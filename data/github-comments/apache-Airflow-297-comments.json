Is this sufficient? I won't have time to add docker, and elastic ingestion nodes etc as I did not add the elastic-search logging support myself.

What is a real use case where you would want to use `none_failed` as in your example?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/580194622/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/580262465","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/7297#issuecomment-580262465","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/7297","id":580262465,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MDI2MjQ2NQ==","user":{"login":"michalslowikowski00","id":22084125,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDg0MTI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22084125?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/michalslowikowski00","html_url":"https://github.com/michalslowikowski00","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michalslowikowski00/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michalslowikowski00/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michalslowikowski00/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michalslowikowski00/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michalslowikowski00/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michalslowikowski00/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michalslowikowski00/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michalslowikowski00/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michalslowikowski00/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-30T13:51:27Z","updated_at":"2020-01-30T13:51:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Waiting

the Airflow doc and example docs suggest none_failed is the trigger_rule to use for the join DummyOperator task in DAGs with branching. (See branch_with_trigger.py here \r\nhttps://airflow.apache.org/docs/stable/concepts.html)\r\n \r\none_success won't work because the join task won't wait for all the branches to finish.\r\n\r\nThere are various real uses. Anything that requires branching and then run subsequent downstream tasks needs the join task. E.g a DAG that does task A on weekdays but task B and C on weekends in parallel and always run task D after either A or B+C is finished. More complicated examples exist if such branching are nested. After this PR, problems happen if the branches are nested like the previous example I gave.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/580306040/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/580345026","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6819#issuecomment-580345026","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6819","id":580345026,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MDM0NTAyNg==","user":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-30T16:45:25Z","updated_at":"2020-01-30T16:45:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had recent activity.

I see one of two possible solutions then:\r\n\r\n1. Keep the current behavior of `none_failed` and create a new trigger rule (`none_failed_including_skips` maybe? I don't know) that behaves as in this PR. I saw keep the current behavior for `none_failed` so as to minimize the amount of refactoring we make people do, even though from a documentation perspective, it would make more sense to change the behavior of `none_failed` and move the current behavior to a new operator like `none_failed_one_success` or something like that just because this behavior is more in line with the intuitive reading of `none_failed` and less likely to cause confusion.\r\n\r\n2. It is easy if slightly annoying to work around this by giving an operator with a `none_failed` trigger rule a single upstream `DummyOperator` dependency so that it has at least one success. If we just want to keep the status quo, we definitely want to update the documentation to make it clear what the actual behavior is and how to get the current documented behavior if you want it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/580496345/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/580522543","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/7298#issuecomment-580522543","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/7298","id":580522543,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MDUyMjU0Mw==","user":{"login":"mik-laj","id":12058428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj","html_url":"https://github.com/mik-laj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-31T00:15:48Z","updated_at":"2020-01-31T00:15:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Travis is sad.

If you have any issues or are unsure about any anything please check our Contribution Guide (https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst)\nHere are some useful points:\n- Pay attention to the quality of your code (flake8, pylint and type annotations). Our [pre-commits]( https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/STATIC_CODE_CHECKS.rst#prerequisites-for-pre-commit-hooks) will help you with that.\n- In case of a new feature add useful documentation (in docstrings or in `docs/` directory). Adding a new operator? Check this short [guide](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/docs/howto/custom-operator.rst) Consider adding an example DAG that shows how users should use it.\n- Consider using [Breeze environment](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/BREEZE.rst) for testing locally, it’s a heavy docker but it ships with a working Airflow and a lot of integrations.\n- Be patient and persistent.

How about calling the new trigger rule `all_success_or_skip` ? That makes it easier to comprehend.\r\n\r\n> 1. Keep the current behavior of `none_failed` and create a new trigger rule (`none_failed_including_skips` maybe? I don't know) that behaves as in this PR. I saw keep the current behavior for `none_failed` so as to minimize the amount of refactoring we make people do, even though from a documentation perspective, it would make more sense to change the behavior of `none_failed` and move the current behavior to a new operator like `none_failed_one_success` or something like that just because this behavior is more in line with the intuitive reading of `none_failed` and less likely to cause confusion.\r\n\r\n I do suggest we update the documentation about `none_failed` trigger rule to match what it actually does. Current the doc says this:\r\n```\r\nnone_failed: all parents have not failed (failed or upstream_failed) i.e. all parents have succeeded or been skipped\r\n```\r\nTo describe `none_failed` more precisely, it should say something like this instead:\r\n```\r\nnone_failed: all parents have not failed (failed or upstream_failed) i.e. all parents have succeeded or been skipped. However if all parents are skipped, the task with none_failed trigger_rule will also be skipped.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe doc also has a paragraph that says this, which is not 100% accurate:\r\n```\r\nThe join task will be triggered as soon as branch_false has been skipped (a valid completion state) and follow_branch_a has succeeded. Because skipped tasks will not cascade through none_failed.\r\n```\r\nA more accurate description is like:\r\n```\r\nThe join task will be triggered as soon as branch_false has been skipped (a valid completion state) and follow_branch_a has succeeded. Because skipped tasks will not cascade through none_failed as long as some other parent tasks have succeeded.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhereas the new trigger_rule you are going to add can described something like this:\r\n```\r\nall_success_or_skip: All parents have succeeded or been skipped. If all parents are skipped, the task with `all_success_or_skip` still succeeds.\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince this involves updating the documentation and no change to the behavior of the existing `none_failed` trigger_rule, it should minimize the amount of changes users have to make.\r\n\r\nThe addition of `all_success_or_skip` can be made in the same PR or a different one. It will make it possible to achieve what this PR originally want to do, having a trigger_rule that succeeds whenever parents are successful or skipped.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/581009288/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/581011325","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/7317#issuecomment-581011325","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/7317","id":581011325,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MTAxMTMyNQ==","user":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-01T09:21:26Z","updated_at":"2020-02-01T09:21:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Just

I also think it is worth solving it, but it will require more time and testing.  If we call the integrate plugins method elsewhere, it will still load GCP and Qubole classes, when it is not needed. In this PR I want to focus only on one small problem and not change the way whole plugins mechanism work. \r\n\r\nMy change is not even related to the plugin loading mechanism at all. This only applies to operators that are in the core. It is a mistake that this code is in the same module. \r\n\r\nBTW. I think that it will also be much easier to do when we drop plugin support for operators, sensors and hook.

If you have any issues or are unsure about any anything please check our Contribution Guide (https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst)\nHere are some useful points:\n- Pay attention to the quality of your code (flake8, pylint and type annotations). Our [pre-commits]( https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/STATIC_CODE_CHECKS.rst#prerequisites-for-pre-commit-hooks) will help you with that.\n- In case of a new feature add useful documentation (in docstrings or in `docs/` directory). Adding a new operator? Check this short [guide](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/docs/howto/custom-operator.rst) Consider adding an example DAG that shows how users should use it.\n- Consider using [Breeze environment](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/BREEZE.rst) for testing locally, it’s a heavy docker but it ships with a working Airflow and a lot of integrations.\n- Be patient and persistent. It might take some time to get a review or get the final approval from Committers.\nApache Airflow is a community-driven project and together we are making it better 🚀.\nIn case of doubts contact the developers at:\nMailing List: dev@airflow.apache.org\nSlack: https://apache-airflow-slack.herokuapp.com/\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/581072311/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/581075478","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/7329#issuecomment-581075478","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/7329","id":581075478,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MTA3NTQ3OA==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-01T22:24:00Z","updated_at":"2020-02-01T22:24:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7329?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#7329](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7329?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/commit/39375c01ced008a715bb2a540df31fe2cf908bbb?src=pr&el=desc) will **increase** coverage by `0.23%`.\n> The diff coverage is `100%`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7329/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&token=WdLKlKHOAU&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7329?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@            Coverage Diff             @@\n##           master    #7329      +/-   ##\n==========================================\n+ Coverage   85.59%   85.83%   +0.23%     \n==========================================\n  Files         863      863              \n  Lines       40520    40520              \n==========================================\n+ Hits        34685    34779      +94     \n+ Misses       5835     5741      -94\n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7329?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [airflow/utils/log/logging\\_mixin.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7329/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy91dGlscy9sb2cvbG9nZ2luZ19taXhpbi5weQ==) | `95.38% <100%> (ø)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [airflow/jobs/scheduler\\_job.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7329/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9qb2JzL3NjaGVkdWxlcl9qb2IucHk=) | `89.34% <0%> (+0.14%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [airflow/jobs/backfill\\_job.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7329/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9qb2JzL2JhY2tmaWxsX2pvYi5weQ==) | `91.88% <0%> (+0.28%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [airflow/hooks/dbapi\\_hook.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7329/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9ob29rcy9kYmFwaV9ob29rLnB5) | `91.73% <0%> (+0.82%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [airflow/models/connection.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7329/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9tb2RlbHMvY29ubmVjdGlvbi5weQ==) | `77.4% <0%> (+0.96%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [airflow/providers/apache/hive/hooks/hive.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7329/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9wcm92aWRlcnMvYXBhY2hlL2hpdmUvaG9va3MvaGl2ZS5weQ==) | `77.55% <0%> (+1.53%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [airflow/providers/mysql/operators/mysql.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7329/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9wcm92aWRlcnMvbXlzcWwvb3BlcmF0b3JzL215c3FsLnB5) | `100% <0%> (+45%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [airflow/security/kerberos.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7329/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9zZWN1cml0eS9rZXJiZXJvcy5weQ==) | `76.08% <0%> (+45.65%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [...w/providers/apache/hive/operators/mysql\\_to\\_hive.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7329/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9wcm92aWRlcnMvYXBhY2hlL2hpdmUvb3BlcmF0b3JzL215c3FsX3RvX2hpdmUucHk=) | `100% <0%> (+100%)` | :arrow_up: |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7329?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** -

After the reload, it leads to the weird behavior below and I am not sure what's going on.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# This can be reproduced by adding below after the imports in `test_baseoperator.py` \r\n### import importlib\r\n### from airflow.models import baseoperator\r\n### importlib.reload(baseoperator)\r\n\r\n# It will fails on the below checks in BaseOperator.chain() and
