If acking is enabled, replaying may kick in if the spout/source supports it;  in all other cases the messages will be lost forever.\n\n``` scala\n        // Collect messages into batches (to optimize network throughput), then flush them.\n        while (msgs.hasNext()) {\n            TaskMessage message = msgs.next();\n            if (messageBatch == null) {\n                messageBatch = new MessageBatch(messageBatchSize);\n            }\n\n            messageBatch.add(message);\n            // TODO: What shall we do if the channel is not writable?\n            if (messageBatch.isFull()) {\n                MessageBatch toBeFlushed = messageBatch;\n                flushMessages(channel, toBeFlushed);\n                messageBatch = null;\n            }\n        }\n```\n\nThe code after the `while` loop will keep any remaining messages -- up to a full batch size -- in memory via the `messageBatch` field in case the channel is not `WRITABLE`:\n\n``` scala\n        // Handle any remaining messages in case the \"last\" batch was not full.\n        if (containsMessages(messageBatch)) {\n            if (connectionEstablished(channel) && channel.isWritable()) {\n              // ...snip...\n            else { // <<< if not WRITABLE, then we keep the remaining messages in memory and try background flushing\n                resumeBackgroundFlushing();\n                nextBackgroundFlushTimeMs.set(nowMillis() + flushCheckIntervalMs);\n            }\n        }\n```\n\nTo illustrate the current behavior (note: this behavior is the same before and after the changes in this pull request -- the PR does not modify this part of the logic) take the following example.\n- Message batch size: `10`\n- `send()` receives a list of `35` messages.\n- The channel becomes unwritable at the time we are processing message 13.\n\nIn this case the code would try to process and split/batch the `35` messages as follows:\n\n```\n10 --> 10 --> 10 --> 5\n\\             /      |\n \\           /       |\n  handled in      handled in if-else after while\n  while loop\n```\n\nHere, the first batch of `10` messages would be successfully written to the channel because the latter is still `WRITABLE`.  The channel would (given our assumption) then become unwritable while we're batching up messages 11-20, and subsequently we would not be able to write messages 11-20 and messages 21-30 to the channel.  Messages 31-35 would be kept in memory (via the `messageBatch` field), and we'd begin background flushing to write those 5 messages.\n\nSo in this scenario:\n- Messages 1-10 would be written successfully.\n- Messages 11-20 and 21-30 would be dropped.  Acking configuration and spout/source behavior would determine whether this dropping would cause message loss or replaying.\n- Messages 31-35 would be buffered in-memory (i.e. not Netty's internal write buffer), and background flushing may or may not be able to successfully write the messages eventually.\n\nIs that a correct summary?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/73847544/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612467177","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4171#issuecomment-2612467177","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4171","id":2612467177,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI0NjcxNzc=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-11T08:30:00Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T12:54:24Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=githubbot\">githubbot</a>:</i>\n<p>Github user miguno commented on the pull request:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/268#issuecomment-73847544\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/268#issuecomment-73847544</a></p>\n\n<p>    I think if the channel is not `WRITABLE` when we are trying to flush a full message batch (or more than one, given that it's part of the `while` loop), then we'll drop those messages until the channel becomes `WRITABLE` again.

But: because there is no backpressure (yet) that we can rely on, this patch will improve at least the situation during the startup phase of a topology to a) prevent that an unacked topo will lose messages during the startup, and b) we do not need to unnecessarily replay messages in case of acked topos during their startup.  This is achieved by checking that all worker connections are ready before the topology starts processing data.\n\nSo backpressure is still an open feature. Backpressure was IIRC mentioned in the initial PR because there was a deficiency (dating back to a ZMQ related TODO) that caused problems related to this PR/Storm tickets (329, 404, and one more).  However, this patch does make the best of the current situation even in the absence of backpressure.
