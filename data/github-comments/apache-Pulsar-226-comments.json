I had to set `stateStorageServiceUrl` to make functions work. Nevertheless, it might be a good idea to supply local BookKeeper URI to functions by default. Thanks for the reply.\r\n\r\n when i debug with localrun mode and use `getCounter()`,I get  `State is not enabled` error too,how to set `stateStorageServiceUrl` ? when i  debug with localrun mode
