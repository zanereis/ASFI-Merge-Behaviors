For e.g. with CosmosDB following [chars are not allowed in id][1]. These may cause issue when used id  is used in URL\r\n\r\n> The following characters are restricted and cannot be used in the Id property: '/', '\\\\', '?', '#' \r\n\r\nSo for '/' `CosmosDBArtifactStore` would replace `/` with `|` as that is not a valid char allowed. If we need to open up the chars allowed in id to any char except '/' then other store implementations would need to store id in encoded form (say base64). \r\n\r\nAlso see [here][2] for some discussion in Apache Jackrabbit project around what aspects may influence which are chars are allowed in names like fields.

All of these should be addressed in a canonical way and fit logically as part of entitlement in my view. You are right to point out that the interface for entitlement is too narrow today because it ignores the kind or additional resource requirements I noted. \r\n\r\nI’d favor encapsulating these checks in a well defined interface vs integrating it with the action api handler. \r\n\r\nFurther, note that the approach of white listing namespaces as done with a deployment configuration makes it more static whereas I view such lists as something that will be dynamic: the privileges should perhaps be part of the identity record (like other limits today) and we should provide an interface to black list and white list (or rather change the rights of the subject). \r\n\r\nI know this broadens scope much more than you’ve done. We can discuss the design and work toward that but allow a transient path to make progress in the meantime.

However, as a platform provider there is a need to periodically add support for additional kinds without allowing use across the entire system. Initially we want to restrict these kinds to certain namespaces which are owned and controlled by approved maintainers of the system.\r\n2) We need to restrict the use of `blackbox` kinds to a namespace containing provider-owned actions which are usable by others within the system. Only actions in these namespaces should be allowed to be created as `blackbox` kinds.\r\n\r\nEventually, this could be handled at an IAM/ACL/oauth level. However, there is no such construct available today. Also, the use cases do not explicitly require a per-subject set of ACLs.\r\n\r\nI see two separate tasks here:\r\n1) Support system-level configuration of how new functionality can be rolled out.\r\n2) Support per-subject IAM and oauth for more granular permissions and
