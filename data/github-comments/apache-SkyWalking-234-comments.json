, so something like `prefix::${a,b,c}::suffix` will work if `a` is empty but `b` is not (say `test`), it evaluates as `prefix::test::suffix`, using `${a},${b},${c}` will need to duplicate the prefixes and suffixes like `prefix::${a}::suffix,prefix::${b}::suffix,prefix::${c}::suffix`, and the empty check is even complicated since `a == null` evaluates `prefix::${a}::suffix` as `prefix::null::suffix`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/839841521/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/839851634","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/6933#issuecomment-839851634","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/6933","id":839851634,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgzOTg1MTYzNA==","user":{"login":"codecov[bot]","id":22429695,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjI0Mjk2OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/254?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/codecov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-12T15:09:55Z","updated_at":"2021-05-12T17:16:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#
