There wasn't any discussion on switching to a pure HTTP client, but we might need to take into consideration the effort it will take and benefits the result will offer if we were to go for that.\r\n\r\nRegarding handling the `Throwable`: I'm currently trying out `BulkItemResponse.getFailure().getStatus` which returns a `RestStatus` (the main reason to switch to this is because ES 1.x doesn't have the `getCause()` method ...., we need something that's usable across all ES versions).\r\n\r\nFrom the Javadocs, it seems like we can just target some of the status codes: https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.elasticsearch/elasticsearch/2.3.5. I'm currently thinking about just handling `TOO_MANY_REQUESTS` (ex. EsRejectedExecutionEx is one of these) and `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` (the timeout exception has this code). What do you think?

IMHO, we should limit the expressions given to the FilterableTableSource to a minimum. E.g. if you look at the [HCatInputFormat](https://hive.apache.org/javadocs/hcat-r0.5.0/inputoutput.html#Filter+Operators) they only support very basic operations `'and', 'or', 'like', '()', '=', '<>' (not equal), '<', '>', '<=' and '>='`. I think that is also enough for our use case. We should also only support basic datatypes. Then we add a Filter after the TableSource in case the TableSource does not support every predicate.

That would be good to keep.\r\n  - One can probably stop the thread when all registries are closed and re-spawn it when new registries come. That would be \r\n\r\nIn summary: I think lingering threads are a type of regression, actually. Introducing that for something that is not broken right now is something I would not do for a release.

catch for that problem.\r\n\r\nI would suggest two changes:\r\n  1. Let's forbid `remove()` in all cases, also when the state is non-queryable. It seems inconsistent that the heap-state allows modifications via the iterable, while the RocksDB state does not.\r\n\r\n  2. It would be nice to get rid of the locking (or the code branch) in the `add()` method:\r\n    - A simple approach is to override `add()` in the queryable state version of the list and synchronize there.\r\n    - A more advanced idea: We may get rid of the locking on the ArrayList alltogether by implementing our own specialized list: Since the list ever only grows (a clear call removes the list as a whole from the map in the heap state) creating a serialized copy means simply taking the list and taking all elements from the list up to the size that are not null (to support `null` we can use a null-marker element). Taking the elements from the list needs to be conservative (take the lower, size or nun-null entries) to compensate for visibility issues across the threads.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/276368686/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/276388661","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3217#issuecomment-276388661","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3217","id":276388661,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NjM4ODY2MQ==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-31T15:08:38Z","updated_at":"2017-01-31T15:08:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks

May be am not getting your concern here. Ya I agree that nested schema is better API but if we go with flat schema then maintaining the family to qualifier relation may not be easy. As you said a seperate TableSource where we define such things would be better.\r\nRegarding HBaseTableSchema I think that is better so that we could modify that class for better serialization and deserialization by adding more logic for different types of classes.

Internally we can and should still use the `family`-`qualifier` but just map everything to a flat schema. The question is whether this would that make the `HBaseTableSource` harder to use. I don't think the column access (`family.qualifier` vs. `family$qualifier`) would be much harder, but acting with families that have lots of columns would be more cumbersome, because each column would be a top-level column and would need to be explicitly selected in a `SELECT` clause. In the nested case, all columns of a family are conveniently grouped together.\r\n\r\nRegarding the `HBaseTableSchema`, we could also use it only internally and not expose it to the user. The `HBaseTableSource` would have a method `addColumn()` and forward the calls to its internal `HBaseSchema`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/276580514/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
