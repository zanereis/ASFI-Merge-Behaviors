I see two main approaches as well as a hybrid.\r\n\r\n**1 - by config:** Doing it as configuration, in `superset_config.py`. If going that route,  I think it's best to give user the full power of configuration as code, and allow them to pass an instantiated `SQLAlchemy` pool object. This enables them to use whatever pool class they see fit, and use whatever parameter they want. In theory they could even create their own pool class here and do as they see fit. This should probably be a `dict` keyed by `database_name` using instantiated pool objects as values.\r\n\r\n**2 - in UI** Doing it in the UI, and expose only the common pool type(s) and parameters that matter. This is likely to be simple at first (only allow `QueuePool` and common parameters like `pool_size, max_overflow, timeout, use_lifo`). An alternative and less form-heavy approach would be to use the current `Extra` json approach and add a key for `queue_pool_parameters` and document how people can pass things like `pool_size, max_overflow, timeout, use_lifo`.\r\n\r\n**3 - hybrid** A hybrid approach could be easy to implement to, where we look for the dict config and fall back on the UI config.\r\n\r\nFor reference, where `Extra` looks like today:\r\n<img width=\"1183\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-01-07 at 9 39 57 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/487433/71915961-b7800380-3131-11ea-94f4-97b04336223c.png\">\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/571690999/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/571695427","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/3524#issuecomment-571695427","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/3524","id":571695427,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MTY5NTQyNw==","user":{"login":"sarithapodali","id":58711660,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NzExNjYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58711660?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarithapodali","html_url":"https://github.com/sarithapodali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarithapodali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarithapodali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarithapodali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarithapodali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarithapodali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarithapodali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarithapodali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarithapodali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarithapodali/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-07T17:46:42Z","updated_at":"2020-01-07T17:46:42Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@everglory99 I face the same issue with temp tables using snowflake.

However, given that Superset usually runs on multiple concurrent worker processes, I think the only way of achieving true pooling would require some sort of locking outside python scope (Redis being the top contender as mentioned above). While it does propose it's own set of challenges (not to mention added complexity), somehow it feels simple enough to be manageable, especially if it can be rolled out as an opt-in feature. Therefore I'd vote to at least try building a Redis locking POC, as it should be pretty quick to put together and see what type of overhead or other problems it might introduce.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/571738818/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/571746004","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/8308#issuecomment-571746004","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/8308","id":571746004,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MTc0NjAwNA==","user":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-07T19:57:14Z","updated_at":"2020-01-07T19:57:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had recent activity.

change management, we did something similar for both \"explore v2\" and \"dashboard v2\", where in the case of \"dashboard v2\", the dashboards had to be validated (and in some cases tweaked) manually individually.\r\n\r\nThings can get intricate as components, endpoints and objects may become shared in intricate ways. For example, the work of deprecating \"explore v1\" became fairly intricate as it was sharing things with v2. Clearly there are pros and cons here, and if we decide to have 2 versions overlap, we should be deliberate on whether we want to go with a \"not DRY\" (where code is duplicated to evolve independently) or a tangled approach (where both versions share components and objects).\r\n\r\nOne thing to mention is that the design is not very clear around state management, and making sure people don't loose work.
