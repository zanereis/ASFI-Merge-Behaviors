Stephan noticed (and I fixed) those problems.\r\n\r\nI think they are important to fix before it gets into hands of developers as this will avoid many first-time issues repeated/reported by many people:\r\n\r\n*  Stephan had some initial struggles with understanding which scripts should be run on host and which in container so I added checks for that (the scripts will print meaningful error if they are run in host but should be in container or the other way round). I also updated docs to emphasise it. I also added more examples with default values for python/backend etc. Plus I added some examples on how to run mypy/pylint/flake when you are inside the environment.\r\n\r\n* Stephan also had python2.7 set as default so (again I had it implemented in pre-commit hooks) I made python 3.6 as default in local scripts even if python2.7 is default in the path. I am also forcing python3.6 when running pylint/mypy/flake/docs - so that they are always run with the same version of python.\r\n\r\n* Also he noticed quite some overhead for running pytest/mypy/pylint with checking the docker for re-builds. I have already optimised it in another commit (pre-commit). so I brought it in (uses md5sum to check if files changed) and now the image for pylint/mypy/flake8/docs is only rebuilt when any of the \"important\" files change (Docker/setup.py etc.). Otherwise it will use already built image - which is almost instanteneuos. I also sped-up pylint along the way (in Mac container it run very long because it was scanning the whole mounted sources - which included 1000s of files in node_modules - and with osxfs being slow it added 20 seconds or so just for 'find' - now it is almost instanteneous. You can also run those static checks for an individual module/file - and I gave some examples how to do it in the docs.\r\n\r\n* I added VERBOSE environment variable - now the scripts are far less verbose by default but you can enable verbosity by setting VERBOSE=\"true\" - this way if somoene will have a problem, setting VERBOSE might help to send the more detailed output.\r\n\r\nI hope you find those changes are really needed for first-time users @ashb :).\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/511140442/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/511144487","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4938#issuecomment-511144487","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4938","id":511144487,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMTE0NDQ4Nw==","user":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-13T18:37:25Z","updated_at":"2019-07-13T18:37:25Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"And one more thing ...

I think it's just the matter of bumping it to higher java version but I did not want to experiment to switch to buster just yet :). I'd rather do it later as separate task or when we do production image. The slim image built just fine, no problems at least at the build stage, it was only the full CI image used to run tests that failed.\r\n\r\nBTW. The nice thing that happened - was that the script is written in such way that it won't push neither of the images if one of them fail :).

What's even more - I also converted the last remaining script (checking the licences) to use docker as well (but this time full CI image as it needs Java). so we have fully dockerized CI build now. \r\n\r\nI also played a bit with the whole environment also on Linux and I think I solved the problem that Stephen reported. When you run tests in container a lot of .pyc files were created using root user on Linux if they were not created before in the host. That caused problems when you try to switch branches and directories are supposed to be deleted (they cannot be because .pyc files are root owned in the host as well).\r\n\r\nI read a bit and I simply did two things: 1) finding and deleting all .pyc files on entering docker container 2) I disabled generation of .pyc files by setting PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=\"true\". It also slows down a little importing (but I have not noticed any slow-down - I will see how it impacts tests on Travis with the current build). Those .pyc files are not as efficient now with multi-processor CPUS and relatively slow docker OSXFS I think it might even be faster without those .pyc bytecode files - this is in ec8182d .\r\nLast, but not least - I also ported some of my later changes to run-test scripts (following your screencast) - right now it performs database intialization only first time it is run per environment (or when you force it with `-i` flag) and it allows to specify `-s` flag to suppress capturing output by nosetest (with some comment explaining how to do ipdb debugging) and -v to switch to verbose output with colors. This is in 4e0b9b2\r\n\r\nI think once it succeeds, it should be more than ready for the prime time.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/511208280/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/511208426","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5489#issuecomment-511208426","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5489","id":511208426,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMTIwODQyNg==","user":{"login":"mik-laj","id":12058428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj","html_url":"https://github.com/mik-laj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-14T14:41:21Z","updated_at":"2019-07-14T14:41:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I looked at this code and the _execute method seems to me unreadable.

I have removed the six module.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/511521781/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/511525842","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5595#issuecomment-511525842","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5595","id":511525842,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMTUyNTg0Mg==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-15T18:54:15Z","updated_at":"2019-07-15T18:54:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/5595?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#5595](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/5595?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/commit/b33b9898677e70ef3fcb4bf03cd28b4077681224?src=pr&el=desc) will **increase** coverage by `0.1%`.\n> The diff coverage is `100%`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/5595/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&token=WdLKlKHOAU&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/5595?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@            Coverage Diff            @@\n##           master    #5595     +/-   ##\n=========================================\n+ Coverage   78.95%   79.05%   +0.1%     \n=========================================\n  Files         489      489             \n  Lines       30684    30684             \n=========================================\n+ Hits        24226    24257     +31     \n+ Misses       6458     6427     -31\n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/5595?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [airflow/www/app.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/5595/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy93d3cvYXBwLnB5) | `97.32% <100%> (ø)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [airflow/utils/dag\\_processing.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/5595/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy91dGlscy9kYWdfcHJvY2Vzc2luZy5weQ==) | `58.25% <0%> (+1.06%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [airflow/jobs/scheduler\\_job.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/5595/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9qb2JzL3NjaGVkdWxlcl9qb2IucHk=) | `70.38% <0%> (+1.24%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [airflow/executors/\\_\\_init\\_\\_.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/5595/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9leGVjdXRvcnMvX19pbml0X18ucHk=) | `66.66% <0%> (+4.16%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [airflow/utils/sqlalchemy.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/5595/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy91dGlscy9zcWxhbGNoZW15LnB5) | `79.06% <0%> (+4.65%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [airflow/executors/sequential\\_executor.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/5595/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9leGVjdXRvcnMvc2VxdWVudGlhbF9leGVjdXRvci5weQ==) | `100% <0%> (+52.38%)` | :arrow_up: |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/5595?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/5595?src=pr&el=footer).

As @ashb mentioned in JIRA - it likely won't be needed in this form when we implement persisting the DAGs /stateless webserver. However it sounds it can be nice as an intermediate solution (and rather smallish incremental change as opposed to big structural change in Airflow itself) until we got all details worked out for those. And can be even cherry-pickable if we ever attempt to release 1.10.5.\r\n\r\nSounds like the idea of stringifying the DAGs is interesting and might be used as a starting point to implement part of DAG persistence (no matter how it will be implemented eventually). It's only for DAG Python code text and 'structure' of course - there is no way this can be used to actually execute the DAGs, but it serves well the purpose that you want fast loading of many DAGs as Python objects in cases where you have to have many DAG objects in the same process (UI/scheduler). But I like the idea to have \"stringified\" and \"real\" version of DAGs - one for structure/code and one for actual execution. Sounds like an interesting optimisation which is pretty independent from any other Airflow features.\r\n\r\nAnd maybe we can use the benefit that this solution is available in Composer already (as alpha) and can be tested on a wide variety of configurations (especially that it is aimed for deployments with big number of DAGs and I assume customers will only enable it when they have big number of DAGs with complex structure). It's very valuable for Airflow community to get code that have been battle-tested already. @coufon -> maybe you can share your experiences with an actual \"production\" usage of this? \r\n\r\nWhat I do not fully understand yet about the current implementation is casting to BaseOperator for non-airflow modules. @coufon - can you maybe explain a bit why this is needed ?\r\n\r\nI understand that the stringified Dags must be picklable to send over multiprocessing Queue and then for the UI to create the objects and be able to show the structure and code. Same in scheduler - we only want to use the Dag code to schedule it. Maybe I am missing something - but I am not sure why this BaseOperator casting is needed in this case as long as all the custom classes are also loaded in webserver/scheduler. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/511660265/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/511661597","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5594#issuecomment-511661597","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5594","id":511661597,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMTY2MTU5Nw==","user":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-16T04:37:23Z","updated_at":"2019-07-16T04:43:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"And I would not worry about multiprocessing queue problems in this case. In this case we have simple Producer -> Consumer case and we use it in the simplest possible way -> put() in producer and get() in consumer.

This (and other) cases shows that we rarely naturally fix all the pylint problems per-file.\r\n\r\nWhile it worked fine for GCP operators/tests, I think the approach proposed by @mik-laj works a bit nicer: https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5587#issuecomment-511205537, however maybe we can modify it slightly.\r\n\r\nI like the idea that you won't fix it file-by-file but warning-by-warning. It sounds much more natural. But I do not like the idea that this means that files will not disappear from the todo list as quickly as we would like them to, and will not prevent people from adding new pylint errors in the meantime to files that are already pretty much cleared.\r\n\r\n@mik-laj already has a script that produces updated pylint_todo.txt so we can regularly re-run and update it (it does not have to be always when we fix some errors - it can be independent and regular). \r\n\r\nI think what might make sense is to combine this approach - maybe we could extend the  script that will run pylint on the whole codebase and produce updated pylint_todo.txt list + list of candidates that can be cleaned really quickly (basically with a few pylint problems left). This way our natural process of fixing pylint problems would look as follows:\r\n\r\n1) Fix particular warning across the board (rinse-repeat for different warnings types) - this can be done independently by different people\r\n2) Regularly (weekly ??) regenerate pylint-todo.txt + fix those files with just a few errors left\r\n3) Repeat.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think @BasPH @mik-laj @nuclearpinguin ?\r\n\r\n@mik-laj - I know you have some tools/scripts that you use to automate some of that work (like creating JIRA issues etc). Maybe you could create a PR with those tools that others (us?) could use as well and we could setup a small 'process' for that. We are down to 4000 errors or so from 5000 but I feel that if we establish this kind of small process, we can invite others to help with the effort and get it done much more quickly. Especially we could encourage new contributors of Airflow to help with that if we give them easy to use process/tools to do it.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/511666687/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/511672797","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5597#issuecomment-511672797","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5597","id":511672797,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMTY3Mjc5Nw==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-16T05:39:00Z","updated_at":"2019-07-16T05:39:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/5597?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#5597](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/5597?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/commit/7d08cacfbbabe95cc147771332125ab806f2ee14?src=pr&el=desc) will **decrease** coverage by `<.01%`.\n> The diff coverage is `0%`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/5597/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&token=WdLKlKHOAU&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/5597?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@            Coverage Diff             @@\n##           master    #5597      +/-   ##\n==========================================\n- Coverage   79.05%   79.05%   -0.01%     \n==========================================\n  Files         489      490       +1     \n  Lines       30684    30685       +1     \n==========================================\n  Hits        24258    24258              \n- Misses       6426     6427       +1\n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/5597?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [...w/contrib/hooks/gcp\\_bigquery\\_data\\_transfer\\_hook.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/5597/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9jb250cmliL2hvb2tzL2djcF9iaWdxdWVyeV9kYXRhX3RyYW5zZmVyX2hvb2sucHk=) | `0% <0%> (ø)` | |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/5597?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/5597?src=pr&el=footer).
