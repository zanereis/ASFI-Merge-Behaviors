But if there are huge number of data, one shard may not be enough.\r\nSince shard is a unit of distribution and replication, too big shard is not good for performance.\r\nAs data grows, at some scale

But it depends on kind of data being stored. This scheme may be ok for whisks where one namespace may contain say 1M entities (which can be stored in single shard). This may not work fine for activations where number of activations may of the order of 10-100M.

\r\nYes. There might not be such huge number of data in one namespace.\r\nBut what if data grows by any possibility, how can we handle that?\r\nAnd if there are not much data, do you expect it will cause any trouble in terms of performance with such small size of data?\r\n\r\nSecond, query is only used to list entities.\r\nAll other APIs, such as get/update/delete and even invoke an action uses normal document get/put api.(surely they can take advantage of cache.)\r\n\r\nAnd I can't expect such huge number of `list` API calls.\r\nAs you mentioned, your approach can improve latency of `list` API.\r\nBut normally `list` API is called by user rather than any systematic call because list is to see what kinds of entities are there. So there may not be 10K or 100K TPS calls.\r\n\r\nThat's the reason why I think action invocation(which includes storing activations) will affect more on the performance and incline to scalable approach.\r\n\r\nAnd, I could not find any support for custom partition key.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/346008437/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/346020503","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/2981#issuecomment-346020503","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/2981","id":346020503,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NjAyMDUwMw==","user":{"login":"dgrove-oss","id":5099100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTkxMDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5099100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss","html_url":"https://github.com/dgrove-oss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-21T13:05:00Z","updated_at":"2017-11-21T13:05:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for the pointer, I'll give it a whirl","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/346020503/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/346032835","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/2810#issuecomment-346032835","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/2810","id":346032835,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NjAzMjgzNQ==","user":{"login":"chetanmeh","id":664531,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NDUzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/664531?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chetanmeh","html_url":"https://github.com/chetanmeh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chetanmeh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chetanmeh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chetanmeh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chetanmeh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chetanmeh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chetanmeh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chetanmeh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chetanmeh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chetanmeh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-21T13:53:53Z","updated_at":"2017-11-21T13:53:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> But normally list API is called by user rather than any systematic call because list is to see what kinds of entities are there.

Learning from proven solutions like Apache Sling is always a valuable asset to avoid making the same things wrong :-)\r\nIndeed we also looked into using Turbofilter, but had to learn that in our case they do not work well. \r\nThe reason is that we use Akka Logging. Log message are passed through the Akka Event Bus (we win asynchronicity on this way) before passed to Logback. When running on INFO level all DEBUG level messaged are not put into the event bus and therefore do not reach Logback and it's filters. The only way to exploit Logback filtering would have been to put all messages into the event bus and use Logback  to filter out the one with the appropriate level. But in this case we would would again see increased memory pressure due to bigger internal buffers needed by the event bus. So we decided for this simpler solution.
