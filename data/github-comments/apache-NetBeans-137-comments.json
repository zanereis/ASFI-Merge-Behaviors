I took the \"upgrade your build system\" to extremes moving from `ant` to `gradle 7.5.x` earlier this year for my main project; then had to back up to `6.8.x`.

Thanks for your help!\r\n\r\nI think the warning dialog in the NetBeans launcher is testing the wrong thing; the problem occurs not when non-ASCII characters occur (c >= 128), but rather when the Win32 GetModuleFileName function returns a string with a question mark in it. The latter happens when there are characters in the path name that cannot be encoded in the system's default codepage (437 on my machine, which can encode certain non-ASCII characters such as the Norwegian æøå). So if the current Windows version is using e.g. a codepage that encodes Cyrillic script, path names with Cyrillic in them should work fine. But if you have Cyrillic script in a path on US Windows, it won't work.\r\n\r\n~~The correct solution would be to change the launcher script to use wchar_t instead of char when passing paths around, and use the corresponding wide-char Win32 functions everywhere (e.g. GetModuleFileNameW instead of GetModuleFileName).~~ (nope, that doesn't solve the JNI problem, and is also not necessary)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1309095085/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1309186173","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/4952#issuecomment-1309186173","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4952","id":1309186173,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5OCJh9","user":{"login":"BradWalker","id":930871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzMDg3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/930871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker","html_url":"https://github.com/BradWalker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-09T18:23:20Z","updated_at":"2022-11-09T18:23:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"It is for issues like this, that I've been working on trying to clean up \"old code\".
