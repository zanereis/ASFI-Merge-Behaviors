This can be avoided by just spinning up a producer and producing to input stream, I will have a prototype for low level (Async and Sync) out soon, you can refer to that \r\n4. This too can be avoided since spinning up a producer in start initializes the stream, I have a working prototype for it. The idea of serializing it and again reading from config is redundant\r\n\r\nOne more thing to be considered in the system is the support of bounded streams, i.e we need to put an EndOfStreamMessage in a stream partition, this can only be done in consumer poll() as of current

I guess it is because the test will try to access something online in US and the access is slow from China. I don't know how to fix this problem. So most likely I will fix the test after I get back US.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/379967775/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/380289933","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/samza/pull/468#issuecomment-380289933","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/468","id":380289933,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MDI4OTkzMw==","user":{"login":"prateekm","id":1085859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODU4NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm","html_url":"https://github.com/prateekm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-11T00:37:17Z","updated_at":"2018-04-11T00:37:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@vjagadish1989 @nickpan47 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/380289933/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/380349752","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/samza/pull/347#issuecomment-380349752","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/347","id":380349752,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MDM0OTc1Mg==","user":{"login":"lindong28","id":5873403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NzM0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5873403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28","html_url":"https://github.com/lindong28","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-11T07:07:04Z","updated_at":"2018-04-11T07:07:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@nickpan47 @prateekm I am able to debug and fix the test failure after using virtual private network.

Should also ensure that adding multiple clients does not increase the shut-down timeout.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/384489940/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/384899083","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/samza/pull/490#issuecomment-384899083","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/490","id":384899083,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NDg5OTA4Mw==","user":{"login":"shanthoosh","id":483745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4Mzc0NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/483745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shanthoosh","html_url":"https://github.com/shanthoosh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shanthoosh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shanthoosh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shanthoosh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shanthoosh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shanthoosh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shanthoosh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shanthoosh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shanthoosh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shanthoosh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-27T08:13:43Z","updated_at":"2018-04-27T08:13:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@prateekm @vjagadish1989 @xinyuiscool \r\nPlease take a look when you get a chance. \r\n\r\nVerification: \r\n\r\n`\r\ni=0\r\nwhile [ $i -lt 100 ]; do\r\n                i=expr $i + 1\r\n                ./gradlew clean :samza-core:test -Dtest.single=\"TestZkBarrierForVersionUpgrade\"  >> ~/test-logs_32\r\ndone;\r\n`\r\n\r\nResult: \r\n\r\n samza: grep -i 'BUILD SUCCESS' ~/test-logs_32 | wc -l\r\n     100\r\n samza:  grep -i 'BUILD FAIL' ~/test-logs_32 | wc -l\r\n       0","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/384899083/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/385063999","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/samza/pull/486#issuecomment-385063999","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/486","id":385063999,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NTA2Mzk5OQ==","user":{"login":"vjagadish","id":7350060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNTAwNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7350060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjagadish","html_url":"https://github.com/vjagadish","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjagadish/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjagadish/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjagadish/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjagadish/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjagadish/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjagadish/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjagadish/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjagadish/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjagadish/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-27T19:00:03Z","updated_at":"2018-04-27T19:00:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Merged and submitted!

offline discussion with @vjagadish1989, @jmakes and @cameronlee314:\r\n\r\nWhile this PR looks pretty good and will work as-is, it would be cleaner to take a different approach to the API.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion is to deprecate the current `ExtendedSystemAdmin#getNewestOffset(SystemStreamPartition ssp, Integer maxRetries)` API and add a new `SystemAdmin#getSystemStreamMetadata(Set<SystemStreamPartition> ssps)` API instead. This new API is an optimization of the existing `SystemAdmin#getSystemStreamMetadata(Set<String> streams)` API, in that it allows fetching metadata for specific partitions instead of the entire stream. The default implementation of this new API can fetch metadata for all streams in the requested SSP set using the current API, and select the SSPs that were requested. Systems can override this if a better batch API is available.\r\n\r\nThen, we can add a cache on top of this new API that has similar prefetch logic as in this PR. For example, it could be a use-case specific `ChangelogMetadataCache` that maintains metadata for the changelog partitions for the container, and is used by the TaskStorageManager. Alternatively, it could be a more general implementation of the StreamMetadataCache, (or a separate SSPMetadataCache) that maintains metadata for all SSPs used in the container. We could also tune the cache TTL based on the commit interval such that we reduce the frequency of metadata fetches.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/385754342/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/385761953","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/samza/pull/499#issuecomment-385761953","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/499","id":385761953,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NTc2MTk1Mw==","user":{"login":"shanthoosh","id":483745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4Mzc0NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/483745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shanthoosh","html_url":"https://github.com/shanthoosh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shanthoosh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shanthoosh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shanthoosh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shanthoosh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shanthoosh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shanthoosh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shanthoosh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shanthoosh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shanthoosh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-01T19:15:35Z","updated_at":"2018-05-01T19:15:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@vjagadish1989

So for rocksDb, I reset the position when returning the iterator (no concurrency within a task allowed here), and for inmemory, I creates a submap so I can create new iterator for it every time.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/386081801/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/386098830","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/samza/pull/485#issuecomment-386098830","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/485","id":386098830,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NjA5ODgzMA==","user":{"login":"ahmedahamid","id":10718804,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzE4ODA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10718804?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedahamid","html_url":"https://github.com/ahmedahamid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedahamid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedahamid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedahamid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedahamid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedahamid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedahamid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedahamid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedahamid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedahamid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-02T19:48:56Z","updated_at":"2018-05-02T20:06:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":" Thank you for taking the time to review the PR, Boris.

The Get and Iterator APIs can be used to read data from a specified snapshot. In a sense, a Snapshot and an Iterator both provide a point-in-time view of the database, but their implementations are different. Short-lived/foreground scans are best done via an iterator while long-running/background scans are better done via a snapshot. An iterator keeps a reference count on all underlying files that correspond to that point-in-time-view of the database - these files are not deleted until the Iterator is released. A snapshot, on the other hand, does not prevent file deletions; instead the compaction process understands the existence of snapshots and promises never to delete a key that is visible in any existing snapshot.\r\n\r\nSnapshots are not persisted across database restarts: a reload of the RocksDB library (via a server restart) releases all pre-existing snapshots.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/386175492/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/386473280","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/samza/pull/502#issuecomment-386473280","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/502","id":386473280,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NjQ3MzI4MA==","user":{"login":"shanthoosh","id":483745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4Mzc0NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/483745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shanthoosh","html_url":"https://github.com/shanthoosh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shanthoosh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shanthoosh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shanthoosh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shanthoosh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shanthoosh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shanthoosh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shanthoosh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shanthoosh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shanthoosh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-04T00:10:23Z","updated_at":"2018-05-04T00:10:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@dnishimura @vjagadish1989 @xinyuiscool \r\nPlease take a look when you get a chance.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/386473280/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/386661647","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/samza/pull/491#issuecomment-386661647","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/491","id":386661647,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NjY2MTY0Nw==","user":{"login":"xinyuiscool","id":24738423,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzM4NDIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24738423?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool","html_url":"https://github.com/xinyuiscool","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-04T16:51:37Z","updated_at":"2018-05-04T16:51:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bharathkk : the updated patch looks much cleaner and now we have a way to deprecate the env var in the future.
