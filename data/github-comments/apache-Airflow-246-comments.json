@mik-laj , \r\nAs Kaxil said, it was my request and I can answer all of your questions. \r\n\r\nFirst of all, no one at Google (except for me, but I am wearing by Apache & Airflow hat here) has access to GA. And be assured I used some screenshots only (about # of visitors per day)  without any personally identifying info to make the case to get funding for the website development from Google. These statistics are valuable because we are investing in the website and we want to make sure that new UX/UI works and brings value to Airflow users. It is also important for improving the most valuable pages of documentation (including measuring the effects from Season of Docs effort) and see how user behavior changes throughout time. Without GA, i don't think we can have a similar amount of fine-grained information around pageviews, navigation of the website, and time spent on each page (not counting also geographical interest, which can help us fund meetups around the world).\r\n\r\nBesides me, Sid, Kaxil and Ash have currently access to GA, all of them are Project Management Committee and someone from Apache as you say. But I am also sending email to add everyone in the PMC. \r\n\r\nAbout GDPR it seems we can comply with it if we don't track any User login info (which we don't) and so we don't strictly have to have any notice [1]. The practice in other Apache Projects is to add the following notice to our website:\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------\r\nWEBSITE USAGE PRIVACY POLICY\r\nInformation about your use of this website is collected using server access logs and a tracking cookie. The collected information consists of the following:\r\n- The IP address from which you access the website;\r\n- The type of browser and operating system you use to access our site;\r\n- The date and time you access our site;\r\n- The pages you visit; and\r\n- The addresses of pages from where you followed a link to our site.\r\nPart of this information is gathered using a tracking cookie set by the Google Analytics service and handled by Google as described in their privacy policy. See your browser documentation for instructions on how to disable the cookie if you prefer not to share this data with Google.\r\nWe use the gathered information to help us make our site more useful to visitors and to better understand how and when our site is used. We do not track or collect personally identifiable information or associate gathered data with any personally identifying information from other sources.\r\nBy using this website, you consent to the collection of this data in the manner and for the purpose described above.\r\nThe ASF welcomes your questions or comments regarding this Privacy Policy. Send them to dev@airflow.apache.org\r\n-------------------------------------------------\r\nAnd lastly, i strongly -1 the alternative that you suggested. I don't see a point of abandoning the 'standard' web analytics tool that we can configure to be GRDP compliant and using far less popular project that personally I don't know how to use and have no bandwidth to study. \r\n\r\n[1] https://www.cookiebot.com/en/google-analytics-gdpr/\r\n[2] https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/privacy.html\r\n[3] https://activemq.apache.org/privacy-policy.html\r\n[4] https://mahout.apache.org/general/privacy-policy\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Please stops comment on this PR.\r\n# Discussion moved to https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5817","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/520946607/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/520964271","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5808#issuecomment-520964271","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5808","id":520964271,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMDk2NDI3MQ==","user":{"login":"feluelle","id":23282078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjgyMDc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23282078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle","html_url":"https://github.com/feluelle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-13T18:58:21Z","updated_at":"2019-08-13T18:58:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Agree with Fokko.

And it was much easier to do the \"series\" of commits. They all depend on the #5777 and once I merge that one (Thanks @fokko for the approaval), I will actually change those commits/PR and make them totally separate (and not depending on each other).

It is an edge case but I wonder if we could something to prevent it. For sure mounting whole source directory /adding it to .docker ignore is a bad idea - performance especially on Mac will suffer and docker caching will be impacted.\r\n\r\nWe could however make a simple test to validate that there are no unexpected entries at the top level and fail the build if there are some unexpected files/directories. We can simply whitelist those that are expected and add the files to that whitelist if we intentionally add it. I think that might solve the problem permanently. WDYT.
