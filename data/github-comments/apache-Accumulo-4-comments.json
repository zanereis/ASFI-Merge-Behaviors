Adding this wouldn't be expressly prohibited from older branches because the o.a.a.core.iterators package (and its sub-packages) aren't covered in our public API definition.

The completely mocked-out IteratorEnvironment is a sign that I haven't thought past the scan case. I'm not even sure if the ColumnFiltering iterator with SortedMapIterator is even a 100% valid in-memory reproduction of how it works in a TabletServer.\n\nI had left input entirely up to the user, so I'm not sure of a simple way to test deletions without potentially messing up some expected table structure. There are some tricky edge cases at compaction that I haven't yet considered how to encapsulate.

I am really curious about the behavior of thrift when a oneway throws an exception on the server side.\n\nBest as I understand it: the oneway modifier just equates to the generated code not calling the method to read the response for an RPC off the wire. This has multiple implications:\n1. The caller does not know if the application received the message (only that the network connection succeeded).\n2. The caller does still receive a response object (this is how void works though, not oneway)\n3. If you try to run another RPC that isn't oneway on the same connection, it's possible that the synchronous call will get goofed up by that oneway's void response (this might be a Thrift bug -- it's certainly a pain to work around).\n\nLet me test what actually happens in the client code when the oneway throws an exception.

Let's define some stuff:\n- Given a request A with response A' over a \"normal\" synchronous thrift call\n- Given a request B with response B' over a oneway thrift call\n- Both of these requests are submitted over the same connection\n- A is run in one thread, B in another (with a latch to ensure they start at the same time)\n1. If A is not submitted and the computation of B' in the server throws an exception, the caller of B does not see this exception. Only side-effect is a server-side log message.\n2. If the order of execution as seen by the client is `A, B, B', A'`, the client will typically get an exception trying to read A'\n3. If the order of execution as seen by the client is `B, A, A', B'`, then both threads see exceptions.\n4.
