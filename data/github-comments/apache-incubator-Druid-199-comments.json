the moment my use-case is local indexing task (\"index_hadoop\" but without remote Hadoop cluster) with ioConfig type \"hadoop\" and input path pointing to \"s3a://bucket/...\" location, all running on AWS vms. The feature I wanted to use is role-based access to S3, which allows reading data from storage using credentials taken from environment (EC2 vm). This make s3a implementation call out to aws sdk and version incompatibility arises caused by very similar exception as mentioned here, i.e.:\r\n```\r\nCaused by: java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: com.amazonaws.AmazonWebServiceRequest.copyPrivateRequestParameters()Ljava/util/Map;\r\nat com.amazonaws.services.s3.AmazonS3Client.invoke(AmazonS3Client.java:3506) ~[?:?]\r\nat com.amazonaws.services.s3.AmazonS3Client.headBucket(AmazonS3Client.java:1031) ~[?:?]\r\nat com.amazonaws.services.s3.AmazonS3Client.doesBucketExist(AmazonS3Client.java:994) ~[?:?]\r\nat org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.S3AFileSystem.initialize(S3AFileSystem.java:297) ~[?:?]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI thought that using newer hadoop-aws.jar would help, but using the oldest newer than 2.7, that is 2.9 didn't help in itself. Instead it had other errors due to incompatibilities between different jars. In afterthought, maybe the culprit is not hadoop-aws.jar, but simply the fact that hadoop-dependencies/2.7 uses too old aws-java-sdk and converging it on the same version as placed in extensions/druid-hdfs-storage/ would be enough (though it will likely require several other jars to be brought in sync between those two dirs).\r\n\r\nI could try using ``mapreduce.job.classloader = true`` and/or just upgrading aws sdk.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/415328785/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/415350679","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/6200#issuecomment-415350679","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6200","id":415350679,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNTM1MDY3OQ==","user":{"login":"hellobabygogo","id":8693129,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2OTMxMjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8693129?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hellobabygogo","html_url":"https://github.com/hellobabygogo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hellobabygogo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hellobabygogo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hellobabygogo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hellobabygogo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hellobabygogo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hellobabygogo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hellobabygogo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hellobabygogo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hellobabygogo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-23T09:22:01Z","updated_at":"2018-08-23T09:22:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"hi， ShilpaSivanesan \r\nhow to use statsD Emitter can you give me an example? i found the metrics log \r\n2018-08-23T17:19:12,415 DEBUG [MonitorScheduler-0] io.druid.emitter.statsd.StatsDEmitter - Metric=[null] has no StatsD type mapping\r\n\r\nhow to fix it?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/415350679/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/415370680","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/6200#issuecomment-415370680","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6200","id":415370680,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNTM3MDY4MA==","user":{"login":"QiuMM","id":15156517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTU2NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15156517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/QiuMM","html_url":"https://github.com/QiuMM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QiuMM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QiuMM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QiuMM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QiuMM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QiuMM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QiuMM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QiuMM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QiuMM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QiuMM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-23T10:37:35Z","updated_at":"2018-08-23T10:37:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@hellobabygogo The doc of statsD Emitter: http://druid.io/docs/latest/development/extensions-contrib/statsd.html.

It's initializing forward and reverse dictionary.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1076\" alt=\"2018-08-28 9 02 07 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1198446/44724736-2f81f680-ab06-11e8-898f-2d58848a0111.png\">\r\n\r\nFrom [the code](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/blob/0.12.0/processing/src/main/java/io/druid/query/groupby/epinephelinae/RowBasedGrouperHelper.java#L993) we can see, the initial dictionary capacity is 10000. So every SpillGrouper needs to allocate at least two 10000-sized dictionary. We have `processing.numThreads` set to 31 and QPS around 30, therefore each second we're creating 1860's 10000-sized dictionary, which causes high GC activities.\r\n\r\nMost of our groupby queries returns just  a few rows, initializing 10000-sized dictionary is a waste.\r\n\r\nThis bug was introduced by #4707. Before 0.12, [initial dictionary is empty](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/blob/0.11.0/processing/src/main/java/io/druid/query/groupby/epinephelinae/RowBasedGrouperHelper.java#L907). #4707 changes it to 10000.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/416583814/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/416616545","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/6255#issuecomment-416616545","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6255","id":416616545,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNjYxNjU0NQ==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-28T14:52:20Z","updated_at":"2018-08-28T14:52:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Great

Could you share some more details of your use case? I wonder especially how large the dictionary was. I set the initial size of dictionary map to 10000 because I thought SpillingGrouper isn't supposed to be used for small dictionary.\r\n\r\nHi @jihoonson , as you commented in #6256 , ConcurrentGrouper always uses SpillingGrouper as sub-groupers no matter whether spilling is enabled or not. So dictionary is initialized for all groupby queries even when it's not used (not grouping by string columns).\r\n\r\nOne of our use cases is providing realtime KPI monitoring for BD (business developer).
