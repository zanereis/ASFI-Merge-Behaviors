But while I merging documentations I found contents and numbering of titles are also varies between documents. \n- Some documents has overview but some are not.\n- Some documents use numbering at titles but some are not.\n- Some documents has spaces between titles and paragraph but some are not.\n- Some documents use <br/> tags to make line spaces but some are not.\n\nSo It may need to build some standard guidelines in documentation styles to give ground rules for users to start documentation on their proposing features. If that guidelines goes well with the community, It will be easy to add nice design and document format in the future. (like http://getbootstrap.com or other OSS projects)\n\nAny suggestions?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/172368367/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/172371433","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/646#issuecomment-172371433","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/646","id":172371433,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MjM3MTQzMw==","user":{"login":"felixcheung","id":8969467,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5Njk0Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8969467?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung","html_url":"https://github.com/felixcheung","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-17T19:50:39Z","updated_at":"2016-01-17T19:50:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"And
