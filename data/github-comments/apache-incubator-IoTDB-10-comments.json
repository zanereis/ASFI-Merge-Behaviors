current implementation is good, but not the best. The problem is that when replications are used, nodes will have overlapped timeseries. For example, node1,2,3 all have timeseries1,2,3, so 3 times as much timeseries will be transferred to respond to the query, let alone further deduplication.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is: you should query each group instead of each node, and the queried node will know from the parameter `header` which group you are querying, so it will only send the timeseries that are actually managed by the node (Remember we use the storage group to partition timeseries schema).\r\n\r\nIt is up to you to make an improvement within this pr or start another pr.
