If we provide only ONE SPI implementation, the class should  implement these three interfaces, and the configuration may like this :\r\n> # \r\n     shardingAlgorithms:\r\n      <sharding-algorithm-name> (+): # 分片算法名称\r\n        type: CLASS_BASED   # 分片算法类型\r\n        props: # 分片算法属性配置\r\n          strategy: standard\r\n          preciseAlgorithmClassName: org.xxx.example.PreciseShardingAlgorithm\r\n          rangeAlgorithmClassName: org.xxx.example.RangeShardingAlgorithm\r\n      <sharding-algorithm-name> (+): # 分片算法名称\r\n        type: CLASS_BASED   # 分片算法类型\r\n        props: # 分片算法属性配置\r\n          strategy: complex\r\n          algorithmClassName: org.xxx.example.ComplexKeysShardingAlgorithm\r\n      <sharding-algorithm-name> (+): # 分片算法名称\r\n        type: CLASS_BASED   # 分片算法类型\r\n        props: # 分片算法属性配置\r\n          strategy: hint\r\n          algorithmClassName: org.xxx.example.HintShardingAlgorithm\r\n      # ...\r\n\r\n\r\n2. We provide THREE SPI implementations, so their types can be different, and the configuration may like this : \r\n> # \r\n      shardingAlgorithms:\r\n        <sharding-algorithm-name> (+): # 分片算法名称\r\n          type: CLASS_BASED_STANDARD   # 分片算法类型\r\n          props: # 分片算法属性配置\r\n            preciseAlgorithmClassName: org.xxx.example.PreciseShardingAlgorithm\r\n            rangeAlgorithmClassName: org.xxx.example.RangeShardingAlgorithm\r\n        <sharding-algorithm-name> (+): # 分片算法名称\r\n          type: CLASS_BASED_COMPLEX   # 分片算法类型\r\n          props: # 分片算法属性配置\r\n            algorithmClassName: org.xxx.example.ComplexKeysShardingAlgorithm\r\n        <sharding-algorithm-name> (+): # 分片算法名称\r\n          type: CLASS_BASED_HINT   # 分片算法类型\r\n          props: # 分片算法属性配置\r\n            algorithmClassName: org.xxx.example.HintShardingAlgorithm\r\n          # ...\r\n\r\n\r\nI prefer to the second one, can you give some suggestions？\r\nThanks!\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/734189671/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/734191849","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/8321#issuecomment-734191849","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/8321","id":734191849,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczNDE5MTg0OQ==","user":{"login":"lazyboyl","id":49420893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NDIwODkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49420893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lazyboyl","html_url":"https://github.com/lazyboyl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lazyboyl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lazyboyl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lazyboyl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lazyboyl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lazyboyl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lazyboyl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lazyboyl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lazyboyl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lazyboyl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-26T09:45:54Z","updated_at":"2020-11-26T09:45:54Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"application.properties I know how to configure it.

@junwen12221 ,\r\n\r\nSorry for my late response, as I am writing a demo to implement the query optimization and federated SQL these days. \r\nYour explanation makes sense to me. My big thanks for your share!  \r\nFrom [104-optimizer](https://github.com/MyCATApache/Mycat2/blob/master/doc/104-optimizer.md), I know you are specializing in Calcite and query optimization. I wonder whether you are interested in this community to participate in this feature? My big welcome. : )\r\n\r\nBTW, what do you think `ProjectableFilterableTable`? I am considering using it instead of `TranslatableTable` to get data from actual databases. Given `push down` rule, I suppose `ProjectableFilterableTable` is enough to filter rows. Besides, it seems `TranslatableTable` has the same function but is more complicated. Do you think which scenario will make us choose `TranslatableTable` rather than `ProjectableFilterableTable`?\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your any innovative ideas.\r\n\r\nBest wishes,\r\nTrista","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/734255476/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/734285548","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/8333#issuecomment-734285548","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/8333","id":734285548,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczNDI4NTU0OA==","user":{"login":"kimmking","id":807508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzUwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/807508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking","html_url":"https://github.com/kimmking","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-26T13:00:54Z","updated_at":"2020-11-26T13:01:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi,

I don't care which project or community. This technology already exists in closed source software.\r\n\r\nCalcite converts  SQL  to `LogicalTableScan ` , before  `LogicalTableScan ` applys other table interfaces.\r\n\r\n`ProjectableFilterableTable `(`FilterableTable`,`ScannableTable`) has built-in rules in calcite, so you can use it to achieve pushdown projection and filtering, and correspondingly you can generate about ```\r\nselect\r\n... from... Where... \r\n```, but if you want to define more relnode (your own SQL generating rules), you can use `TranslatableTable`(or perform conversion in other stages). It can use relnode of your defined table instead of using `LogicalTableScan `. Relatively, you need to write your own rules to optimize it. In fact, a table can be `ProjectableFilterableTable `, `TranslatableTable`, `FilterableTable`, `ScannableTable `or **custom interface**.\r\n\r\nWhen the result of `TranslatableTable `is `LogicalTableScan `, it is trivial.The result also can be another `ProjectableFilterableTable `  RelNode.\r\n\r\nA conservative approach is to distinguish multiple converters or optimizers. In the first stage, when SQL generates relnode, use the built-in table interface and rules of calculate, and then try your own rules or do the next transformation in the second stage.\r\n\r\nIf you know all the rules, you can perform all transformations in one phase.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/734675267/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/734675903","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/pull/8372#issuecomment-734675903","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/8372","id":734675903,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczNDY3NTkwMw==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-27T06:51:01Z","updated_at":"2020-11-27T06:51:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#
