It finished smoothly with this patch.  \r\nThe second test case is 2048 concurrent writes(whole cluster) + 8192 reads(per DN).  8192 reads succeed with accpetable performance. 2048 writes all failed.  The root cause is still leader step down.  It seems this patch is not enough when cluster has a heavy read&write load.
