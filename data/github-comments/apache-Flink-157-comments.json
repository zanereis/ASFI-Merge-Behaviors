In my opinion if we have a better API for Projection may be we could handle it better? The current nested way as you said is better in the sense that all columns of a family are grouped together.

We can keep the interface unchanged, i.e. `def projectFields(fields: Array[Int]): ProjectableTableSource[T]`. But the index of `fields` should be the flat index. We can use the flat field indexes to do projection pushdown even if it is a nested schema.\r\n\r\nFor example, a table source with schema `a: Int, b: Row<b1: String, b2: Int>, c: Boolean`, the flat indexes of `a, b.b1, b.b2, c` are `0, 1, 2, 3`. So a project `SELECT b.b1, c FROM T` will result a `fields` `Array(1,3)`.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think ? \r\n\r\n\r\nFor me the biggest drawback of a nested schema is the lacking support to push projections down.

Even though I implement my own `Timer` scheduler, it just move the `runForever` inside from `ShardConsumerTask`. Because fetch interval is `0`, there is no way to get the next expected execution time and the solution would be running the function forever.\r\n\r\nI think a better solution is defined non-positive fetch interval differs from positive fetch interval and would be executed in another way in the document. The implementation will be two parts: the original way remains the same without `runForever` in `ShardConsumerFetcherTask` and the other is for non-positive fetch interval implemented by using a Thread running `ShardConsumerFetcherTask::run()` forever.\r\n\r\nIt is more reasonable for me to distinguish these two configuration and implement them by using two ways in `ShardConsumer::run()`.

We do not want to expose this as an actual attribute in Flink's SQL (internally, Flink treats record timestamps as metadata which may not be modified by a query).

Actually, RocksDB state's get() method has the idiom of returning a (deserialized) **copy** with which the user can do whatever he likes to, knowing that changes are not reflected in the state back-end. This is also what the window evictors rely on, e.g. `TimeEvictor#evict()`: it uses list state and iterates over the elements removing the ones it wants to remove. Later on, `EvictingWindowOperator#emitWindowContents()` clears the list state and (re-)adds all remaining elements of that iterator back to the list state. Forbidding `remove()` for all cases would require a lot of refactoring there with potential affects in user-defined evictors, too. Since window operators are not queryable though, that was the next-best and least-invasive solution since returning an actual copy in the heap list state implementation was also not desired.\r\n\r\n2. Sounds nice, I'll do some changes to create a version without the code branch using a specialised class for queryable list state. The branching then moves to `HeapKeyedStateBackend#createListState` where it is only called once per creation.\r\n\r\n2. The specialised `ArrayList` implementation sounds like a nice idea but unfortunately, the window evictors' use mentioned above does not follow the assumption of an ever-growing list and makes things more complicated again.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/277212752/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/277248203","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3205#issuecomment-277248203","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3205","id":277248203,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NzI0ODIwMw==","user":{"login":"ex00","id":13835761,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODM1NzYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13835761?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ex00","html_url":"https://github.com/ex00","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ex00/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ex00/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ex00/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ex00/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ex00/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ex00/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ex00/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ex00/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ex00/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-03T13:37:51Z","updated_at":"2017-02-03T14:52:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@jgrier

It looks OK, but this is because the query computes non-grouped aggregates. \r\n\r\nIn case of grouped aggregates, the resulting plan will be less efficient than the plan I proposed because the it will not reuse existing partitioning and sorting properties of the data. This will result in at least one shuffle and one full sort for each distinct aggregate.\r\n\r\nThe trick is to explicitly partition the data for the distinct operation on a subset (i.e., the grouping keys) of the attributes that usually would be used. The following aggregations and joins can be performed in a streaming fashion without partitioning or sorting the data again. This is not possible with your plan. \r\n\r\nWe could try to implement that with some tweaking as an optimization rule (which would be custom and based on the rule you copied from Calcite) or implement it as a dedicated `DataSetRelNode` for distinct aggregates. I'm more in favor of the latter option. \r\nOnce, the optimizer tracks physical data properties, it is easier to implement distinct aggregates using optimizer rules.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/277684416/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/277690481","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3232#issuecomment-277690481","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3232","id":277690481,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NzY5MDQ4MQ==","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-06T14:05:51Z","updated_at":"2017-02-06T14:05:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yes, please continue to comment after pushing changes :)\r\n\r\nI'll have to try this out on a cluster to be certain, but from the looks of it this is good to merge.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/277690481/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/277694620","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3270#issuecomment-277694620","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3270","id":277694620,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NzY5NDYyMA==","user":{"login":"mylog00","id":6622810,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MjI4MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6622810?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mylog00","html_url":"https://github.com/mylog00","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mylog00/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mylog00/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mylog00/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mylog00/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mylog00/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mylog00/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mylog00/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mylog00/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mylog00/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-06T14:19:24Z","updated_at":"2017-02-06T14:19:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think it is independent examples and make it so similar not necessary.
