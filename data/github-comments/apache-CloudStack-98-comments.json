238 and 451, (despite being the very same piece of code) I worry about the exception that is not being logged. I mean, we will see that message, but the exception stack that might be useful for debugging will not be logged.\n\nAdditionally, the code between lines 232 and 239, it seems that it might occur an infinite loop there (before the commit the throw new CloudRuntimeException would break it). I know that when we deal with a connection to a resource, there are hundreds of things that can go wrong and sometimes if we try once or twice it might solve the problem. However, a code that may enter into an infinite loop with a hidden exception does not sound a neat solution for me. \n\nWould not it be better to retry a few times and then, if nothing changes, let an exception happens to break that flow of execution?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/200888647/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/200897012","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1430#issuecomment-200897012","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1430","id":200897012,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwMDg5NzAxMg==","user":{"login":"swill","id":13644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill","html_url":"https://github.com/swill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-24T15:50:16Z","updated_at":"2016-03-24T15:50:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I see your point and I agree with you.

So, when a management restart happens, it syncs data from the secondary storage to see which files are present and which files need to be downloaded and it is at this point that the managment server sets the templates in the DB to `not ready` state. I'm not sure if this is the case with pure NFS but you might want to look at your `template.properties` files on the NFS to make sure they are correct. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/201355723/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/201368034","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1326#issuecomment-201368034","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1326","id":201368034,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwMTM2ODAzNA==","user":{"login":"bvbharatk","id":2075740,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzU3NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2075740?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvbharatk","html_url":"https://github.com/bvbharatk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvbharatk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvbharatk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvbharatk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvbharatk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvbharatk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvbharatk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvbharatk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvbharatk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvbharatk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-25T17:07:08Z","updated_at":"2016-03-25T17:07:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"_Link to logs Folder (search by build_no):_ https://www.dropbox.com/sh/yj3wnzbceo9uef2/AAB6u-Iap-xztdm6jHX9SjPja?dl=0\n\n### ACS CI BVT Run\n\n **Sumarry:**\n Build Number 128\n Hypervisor xenserver\n NetworkType Advanced\n Passed=99\n Failed=4\n Skipped=4\n\n**Failed tests:**\n- integration.smoke.test_guest_vlan_range.TestDedicateGuestVlanRange\n  -
