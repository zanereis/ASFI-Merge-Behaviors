This issue is to **speed the metadata loading**. \r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nAfter some of the researches, we propose another solution to solve this issue.\r\n\r\nCurrently, **a rough solution** is that we can load metadata through [information_schema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_schema) from different databases. (Thanks for your work! @tuohai666  )\r\n\r\nSpecifically, we do some queries from `information_schema`  and skip JDBC' call for databases. In addition, the JDBC loading method **will remain** for conservative treatment.\r\n\r\n### Plan\r\nIn the beginning, I will design the basic framework and interfaces and then implement `MySQL` loading process. After that, we would like to ask our community for help to implement `PostgreSQL`, `Oracle`, `SQLServer`, and `H2`.
