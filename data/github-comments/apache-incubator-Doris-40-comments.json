**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n> At present, Doris uses a 32-bit integer signature for string type in bitmap. e.g. count(distinct v1). v1 is bitmap type which use bitmap_hash to calculate the hash_value.\r\n> \r\n> Although the performance of 32-bit integer signature is better than that of 64 bit, the data precision is low due to the collision rate.\r\n> \r\n> Therefore, the result value in Doris is inconsistent with the result value calculated offline, so we need to explain to the user the reason for the data diff: whether it is caused by the error or the SQL code bug. Gradually, the user no longer believes in the data result of Doris.\r\n> \r\n> An erroneous result is more unacceptable than a slow query.\r\n> \r\n> **Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n> The result value returned by Doris is accurate (100% consistent with the result value calculated offline, e.g. sort -u | wc -l)\r\n> \r\n> **Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n> Current bitmap_hash uses 32-bit integer to calculate the signature. We can add a 64 bit signature function. And it is better to specify the signature algorithm, e.g. murmur3_hash64, so that the subsequent expansion of the signature algorithm is also extended. For example, other signature algorithms are used to calculate the signature, e.g. xxx_hash64\r\n> \r\n> **Additional context**\r\n> At present, the Doris code contains murmur2 / murmur3 signature algorithm.\r\n> \r\n> * murmur_hash3.h: murmur_hash3_x64_64\r\n> * hash_util.hpp: murmur_hash3_32/murmur_hash2_64/murmur_ hash64A (The latter two results are consistent)\r\n> * seed in the hash function: we use 104729\r\n> \r\n> If we use murmur32 signature for nearly 100 million data, there will be 2 ‰ - 8 ‰ error.\r\n> When using murmur64 signature, the error is zero.\r\n> \r\n> In addition, considering the implementation of bitmap, try to consider the signature algorithm witch has smaller high 32 bits.\r\n> \r\n> We find that the distribution of the high 32-bit values of the signature based on 64bit-sign-function is consistent (< 5%%). No one is significantly bigger than the other.\r\n\r\n@yangzhg  I want to fix the issue，can you assign it to me?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/792243732/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/792435191","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/issues/5451#issuecomment-792435191","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/5451","id":792435191,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc5MjQzNTE5MQ==","user":{"login":"qidaye","id":26450235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDUwMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26450235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qidaye","html_url":"https://github.com/qidaye","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qidaye/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qidaye/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qidaye/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qidaye/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qidaye/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qidaye/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qidaye/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qidaye/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qidaye/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-08T03:27:30Z","updated_at":"2021-03-08T03:27:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> The website still shows the broken links\r\n\r\nIt's correct now.
