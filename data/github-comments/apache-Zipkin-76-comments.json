annotations are rarely used (the term annotation in annotationQuery is historical) For the purpose of dropdown I would suggest\r\n\r\n/tags the response could indeed be broken down by service, but in this case the value is more simpler as a map per service name\r\n\r\nex\r\n\r\n```\r\nGET /api/v2/tags\r\n[\"service\": { \"environment\": \"beta\"}, \"service2\"  { \"environment\": \"omicron\"}]\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that breaking down by service has pros and cons. Pro is that a very chatty service who abuses service names can be disabled (though that could also be done on the back end). Con is that there will be a lot of repetition, also a con is that pre-defined tag name/values will be a little more work to break down by service. Ex some sites may choose to limit the predefined key/value obviating a special api for it.\r\n\r\nYou'll notice haystack doesn't currently break down field query by service. They have an api to get the tag keys, and another to get values available for that key. It is a bit simpler, but yeah less insight into whether an auto-complete would succeed or not. https://github.com/ExpediaDotCom/haystack-idl/blob/419450f736634a5f4104998f471d478b632c8bfb/proto/api/traceReader.proto#L84\r\n\r\nSo, another option is just to return the same as they do or everything in one map. One problem with a big map is when people goof cardinality, the performance will suffer greatly I suspect. This is similar to why we have a separate api for service names and span names by service.\r\n\r\nThis leads to an api similar to our service name and span name, also similar to haystack, where you can do a query for tag keys, and another for values by key. Though since these are site defined, I would suggest the api return a friendly label for the key possibly (that or out-of-band config I guess..)\r\n\r\nex\r\n```\r\nGET /api/v2/tagKeys\r\n{\"environment\": \"Environment\", \"threat.level\": \"Maturity\"}\r\n\r\nGET /api/v2/tagValues?key=environment\r\n[\"alpha\", \"beta\", \"omnicron\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn general, data dynamics will be similar in nature to span names api. If we stick to that, we can take advantage of existing code and timeouts around \"name queries\" as querying for tags can be expensive in the same ways span names query are expensive.\r\n\r\nNot all storage currently support a tags query not scoped by serviceName. In this case, maybe if we do make a special \"all\" reserved word, possibly it should not be returned in the case that the backend doesn't support it. I would vote for not differentiating by service thinking it through so far. Interested in other thoughts.\r\n\r\n@openzipkin/core any thoughts? cc also @narayuna @drolando @cwensel from SF
