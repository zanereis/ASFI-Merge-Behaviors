For RM the configuration is extensive to provide lots of flexible options for an admin. As contrast to earlier queue now admin can configure as many queues needed and hierarchy of ResourcePool can be both deep and wide. Each ResourcePool have options to configure selectors, memory resource percentage, queue, etc. Given the configuration is so huge I think it calls for a separation into it's own file. \r\n- Also when RM is enabled then only these configurations will be needed. If RM related configuration is present in drill-override.conf with feature disabled then still Drill will load all of it in memory which won't happen with this separate file in place.\r\n\r\nThis PR only add's support for the new RM configuration parsing and creating in-memory structures. There are still lots of components which needs to be developed like planner components, scheduler, etc. All the changes will come in phases. I have already added functional spec in the JIRA which has detailed explanation about the configuration. But I have also tried adding `package-info.java` with necessary information.

CK does a fine hashing method choosing according to the data types and keys width which is valuable for us to learn. As you mentioned Murmur3Hash does not have a good performance at the shorter integer case.So it's better to use the IntegerHash at the integer keys case.\r\n\r\nThe Boost implementation's discussion you mentioned I had read before. But I think it's reasonable why Boost still keep the current implementation now as a base library. \r\n\r\nThe reason to keep seed away from the hash32 function and involve the Boost's hash_combine method is that I want to change the current hashing strategy later. I plan to change the hash32(hash32(hash32)) row iterate model to `hash32() hash_combine hash32() hash_combine hash32()` column combine model at the multi-keys case. The row iterate module has a data dependency and will hurt the cpu pipeline performance.\r\n\r\nOther hashing methods I know can be found here: https://github.com/benalexau/hash-bench.  It's a java hashing method collection. The benchmark I run showed that https://github.com/OpenHFT/Zero-Allocation-Hashing/blob/master/src/main/java/net/openhft/hashing/LongHashFunction.java 's city_1_1 has a best performance at 32,64 bytes key width.\r\n\r\nI also wonder whether we can do the join keys data type implication at the project node later. So the HashJoin and Exchange node can also benefit from this PR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/469236472/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/469247922","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1639#issuecomment-469247922","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1639","id":469247922,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2OTI0NzkyMg==","user":{"login":"agozhiy","id":31588230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTg4MjMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31588230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/agozhiy","html_url":"https://github.com/agozhiy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agozhiy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agozhiy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agozhiy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agozhiy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agozhiy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agozhiy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agozhiy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agozhiy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agozhiy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-04T13:12:05Z","updated_at":"2019-03-04T13:12:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Conflicts were resolved.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/469247922/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/469282169","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1665#issuecomment-469282169","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1665","id":469282169,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2OTI4MjE2OQ==","user":{"login":"jculio","id":48100759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MTAwNzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48100759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jculio","html_url":"https://github.com/jculio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jculio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jculio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jculio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jculio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jculio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jculio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jculio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jculio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jculio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-04T14:57:15Z","updated_at":"2019-03-04T14:57:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @Charles Givre <cgivre@gmail.com> , I followed your instruction and I\npushed :)\n\nIl giorno ven 1 mar 2019 alle ore 20:36 Charles S.

I'll need to do more fixes to the scan framework, but I'll proceed with that work. Far too difficult to add another option and have to test both paths; doing so would double the effort.\r\n\r\nMy guess is that the original idea was that the partition directories have data and should be considered columns. For example, if data is partitioned by year and month, then those might want to be columns. This is particularly important if the partition columns do not appear within the data itself.\r\n\r\nUsing \"dir0\" and \"dir1\" has always been a hack: they are meaningless names and require that the user map from \"year\" to the partitioning structure and know that, in one table \"dir0\" means \"year\", while in another it might mean \"store\". Moving forward, it would be better to use a Hive-like solution: a mapping from partition directories to columns so that the user sees \"year\" and \"month\" as column names, not \"dir0\" and \"dir1\". Sounds like a job for the new metadata system.\r\n\r\nIf we want a generic directory solution, then allowing a \"dir\" array would be handy: the array can allow any number of entries, avoiding the schema change issues inherent with the current design.\r\n\r\nAgree, all these are more than we can do short term, so let's mothball this change for the Drill 1.x series.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/469357589/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/469370531","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1665#issuecomment-469370531","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1665","id":469370531,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2OTM3MDUzMQ==","user":{"login":"cgivre","id":5513150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTMxNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5513150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre","html_url":"https://github.com/cgivre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-04T18:43:24Z","updated_at":"2019-03-04T18:43:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM

I agree with you. In case if we are to change the structure of the metadata cache file or even change the format in the next version of Drill, the tests need to be rewritten. Yes, metrics of that sort can be added. The proposal is to store a flag allColumnMetadata(to represent column metadata is stored for all the columns) and the subset of columns in the summary file and use it during auto-refresh to store metadata for only the subset of columns. This flag and list can be used to verify the refresh with a subset of columns functionality. But again this will be done in a different Jira in the future.

So changed it to check for a power of two (and greater than 1), and then subtract 1.\r\n\r\nThe test `testUnnestLimitBatchSize_WithExcludedCols()` still fails now. The reason may have to do with LateralJoinBatch-innerNext(), which calls \"update\" on then memory manager (twice - left and right), and **AFTER** that calls allocateVectors().   However the update assumed that the outgoing vectors are already allocated.\r\n   Also allocateVectors() is using \"outputIndex == 0\" to check if the allocation has not yet happened. This may be wrong (e.g., allocated, but batch is still empty).\r\n    In the failed test, the allocated batch was of size 255, but empty, and the update calculated that the remaining size fits 128 entries. So the new allocation size became 127, and the \"max rows\" was calculated as MIN ( 255, 0 + 128 ), hence 128. ==> Thus undoing (2) above could fix that.\r\n \r\n ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/471149386/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/471219735","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1685#issuecomment-471219735","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1685","id":471219735,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MTIxOTczNQ==","user":{"login":"HanumathRao","id":5264087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNjQwODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5264087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao","html_url":"https://github.com/HanumathRao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-09T20:35:34Z","updated_at":"2019-03-09T20:35:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@gparai code changes look good to me. +1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/471219735/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/471235179","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1683#issuecomment-471235179","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1683","id":471235179,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MTIzNTE3OQ==","user":{"login":"paul-rogers","id":3248881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDg4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3248881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers","html_url":"https://github.com/paul-rogers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-10T00:34:12Z","updated_at":"2019-03-10T00:34:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Rebased on latest master.
