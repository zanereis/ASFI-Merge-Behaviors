Looks good to me, thank you for the fix! It's been very frustrating trying to find out how each database handles various types, some return a different JDBC type than the corresponding Java type, and some even differ from each other if the underlying data type is signed or unsigned (which is what happened in this case, the unsigned path was fixed in NIFI-2531 (#823) but the signed path was not).\nTested with various bigint fields in different databases, signed bigint fields with small values (represented in MySQL as java Longs) are processed correctly. Merging to master.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/249874894/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/249884869","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1067#issuecomment-249884869","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1067","id":249884869,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0OTg4NDg2OQ==","user":{"login":"JPercivall","id":11302527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzAyNTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11302527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall","html_url":"https://github.com/JPercivall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-27T14:39:35Z","updated_at":"2016-09-27T14:39:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Reviewing\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/249884869/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/249891022","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1042#issuecomment-249891022","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1042","id":249891022,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0OTg5MTAyMg==","user":{"login":"mcgilman","id":123395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzM5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman","html_url":"https://github.com/mcgilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-27T15:00:21Z","updated_at":"2016-09-27T15:00:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jvwing Just finished up testing and everything looks good.

I just verified this in both the flow.xml and a created template that indeed the default value is serialized and isn't just some UI trick.  So, it just means that for NEW uses of MergeContent the initial default value will be 5.  So I believe the main case you're laying out as a point of concern does not apply as it would still behave the way you'd prefer for existing uses.  Does that eliminate your concern for this part or is there an aspect I am overlooking?\n\nFor the maximum number of entries value the previous setting of nothing meant there was no defined ceiling on the number of flow files which could be merged in a single pass.  This unbounded sort of behavior can be problematic from a memory usage perspective so setting a small default value just means it will now be defined.  Going from undefined to defined behavior could alter the behavior of the flow but of course since it was undefined there was no guarantee.  It also seems like something that could be easily managed in the migration guide and something which would have behavior which is now easy to reason over.  Now, if we were going from defined to undefined then I'd certainly think this would be inappropriate to do outside of probably a major release.\n\nAs for the target memory size the idea wasn't really about a target memory size but rather having a conservative default behavior which the user could adjust if they wanted to.  The value of 100 for max bins was also not targeting a specific memory size when it was chosen and the decision to have the number of entries allowed in a bin by default unbounded was simply a mistake.  What I observed was that on a vanilla install on a laptop I could easily create memory exhaustion using these defaults and the reason why became pretty clear as I had lots of open bins holding lots of flow file objects.  Once I changed to the values mentioned here the behavior was far more intuitive.\n\nAll that said, MergeContent is a complicated animal and desperately needs a custom UI.  That would also serve us quite well but I believe this proposed JIRA and PR is a good step unless I am overlooking some important detail.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/250357032/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/250359429","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1071#issuecomment-250359429","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1071","id":250359429,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MDM1OTQyOQ==","user":{"login":"mosermw","id":10587698,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTg3Njk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10587698?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosermw","html_url":"https://github.com/mosermw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosermw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosermw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosermw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosermw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosermw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosermw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosermw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosermw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosermw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-29T03:06:45Z","updated_at":"2016-09-29T03:06:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Yes @joewitt you've alleviated my concerns about the default for Max Bins.

some of the discussion on the mailing list recently and the original commentary on the JIRA [1], I'd like to propose shifting from an icon based approach when back pressure is engaged to a progress bar style approach where the user can quickly get a sense of how 'full' the queue is currently.\n\n![backpressure](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/123395/19003638/c0abcfc6-871f-11e6-9338-c6b2500c4ee3.png)\n\nThe mockup shows various configuration scenarios. \n- Expiration (clock icon)\n- Object and Data size backpressure (left and right bars respectively)\n- Empty bar - backpressure not configured\n- Partial bar - backpressure configured, partial represent precentage full\n- Full solid bar - backpressure engaged\n\nIf you're up for some additional cycles on this PR I'd be happy to work through the changes with you. If not, I'm happy to take what you started and continue toward the mockup above.\n\nThanks!\n\n[1]
