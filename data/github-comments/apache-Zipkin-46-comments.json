 I've been thinking about how we don't break v3 in process of doing v2. If we change the tags to permit storage of string, number, bool values (as opposed to rejecting them), then the model can upgrade into a more featureful v3 system, particularly with advanced query support.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI think there's definitely a need to keep a v3 in mind when doing v2. How we can eventually support things on our backlog such as analysis or linked traces is important. It is equally important that we can \"upgrade into\" future features (ie usually by adding fields, and at worst removing some). Being future conscious without paralysis or over-engineering today is very tough balance.\r\n\r\nI've know many full-bore systems keep mildly-typed tag values, for filter aggregation or analysis reasons.  For example, [AWS X-Ray](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/blob/master/aws-java-sdk-models/src/main/resources/models/xray-2016-04-12-model.json#L125) and google's [trace proto](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/tracing/trace.proto) have a [3-type value](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/blob/master/aws-java-sdk-models/src/main/resources/models/xray-2016-04-12-model.json#L125) of String bool or number. These can be mapped into json without qualifiers (even though there are some limitations like quoting big numbers). As long as there's only 3 types, we can keep the tags map simple. Basic type is crucial as this allows tags to be a dict vs a list of tuples which is more arduous to map to standard types.\r\n\r\nFor example, eventhough we can't currently query on them, we can still permit basic type tags like so, notably allowing a number.\r\n```json\r\n  \"tags\": {\r\n    \"jdbc.result_count\": 43,\r\n    \"jdbc.query\": \"select distinct `zipkin_spans`.`trace_id` from `zipkin_spans` join `zipkin_annotations` on (`zipkin_spans`.`trace_id` = `zipkin_annotations`.`trace_id` and `zipkin_spans`.`id` = `zipkin_annotations`.`span_id`) where (`zipkin_annotations`.`endpoint_service_name` = ? and `zipkin_spans`.`start_ts` between ? and ?) order by `zipkin_spans`.`start_ts` desc limit ?\"\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother analysis concern is not having to parse the annotations to figure out what they are. One way to accomplish that is to only send a map. However, this is difficult to reverse engineer a user-level description out of, and the lack of that leads to very poor zipkin experience of what I call \"json pooping\". Ex you have a message that is just a json blob. One neat thing I noticed about google's [trace proto](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/tracing/trace.proto) is that it supports both. For example, the annotation still has a primary description field.. and you can later add classification tags for use in filtering or whatnot. In other words, the feature is something you can \"upgrade into\" because the annotation type just gets an \"extra\" field of tags (as opposed to having its primary field replaced by tags)\r\n\r\nEx. In both v1 and v2, annotations look like this (notably v2 excludes the implicit endpoint):\r\n```json\r\n{\"timestamp\":1478624611519000,\"value\":\"mr\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nin V3, we could add or parse classifying tags to it, without breaking existing code.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\"timestamp\":1478624611519000,\"value\":\"mr\", \"tags\": { \"type\": \"messaging\", \"direction\": \"received\"}}\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/265054934/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/265105578","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1427#issuecomment-265105578","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1427","id":265105578,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NTEwNTU3OA==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-06T09:45:05Z","updated_at":"2016-12-06T09:45:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"We probably need something like this, which is from the zipkin-reporter-java producer\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    /**\r\n     * By default, a producer will be created, targeted to {@link #bootstrapServers(String)} with 0\r\n     * required {@link ProducerConfig#ACKS_CONFIG acks}.
