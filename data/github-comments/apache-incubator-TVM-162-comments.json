Tianqi, \r\nNot sure which thread you're referring to. I've managed to compile a Mobilenet TensorFlow model down through TVM to `.wasm` and `.js` files (the JS file being a wrapper over the `wasm`). This includes `SIMD` instructions, using vanilla upstream LLVM. I'd be happy to share details on how to get there, hopefully it'll add value to someone out there. \r\n\r\nI'm struggling now with the `tvm_runtime.js` to ingest the module and infer using it. It seems Emscripten changed their API interface in 2018, and those changes broke TVM code in the `tvm_runtime.js`. So far this is a blocking error: \r\n\r\n```\r\nAssertion failed: Missing signature argument to addFunction\r\nAssertion failed: Missing signature argument to addFunction\r\nRuntimeError: abort(Assertion failed: Missing signature argument to addFunction).

this PR with the same change to the split node's nparts mode.

The latter two stages attach to output stage.  With my nparts change, the latter two stage's IterVars have different ranges from the output stage's IterVar's.  TE generated wrong CUDA code causing numerical mismatch.\r\n\r\nI propose to change schedule_direct_cuda() by removing the threadIdx.x binding in the input padding and weight loading stages.
