I think somehow I forgot to create a JIRA for this although I proposed this change on the devlist. The subject line was `Spring Batch integration` and here's the original content:\r\n```\r\nDear all,\r\n\r\nI'd like to introduce you to the idea of enhancing Fineract with the capability to handle high-volume batch jobs along with a few other things.\r\n\r\nAs any financial system, Fineract also supports batch jobs but they're quite limited on the data volume it can handle. Currently a batch job is a single Java method with loading everything at once and processing that huge chunk of data in a single execution step/transaction.\r\n\r\nTo make Fineract better, we need to alter this simplified framework a little bit and introduce something that's more battle-tested: the Spring Batch module is here to help.\r\n\r\nWith introducing Spring Batch into the mix, we'll finally have a chance to decouple data reading, processing and data writing that'll finally bring us the benefit of making our batch jobs:\r\n- faster\r\n- reliable\r\n- being able to handle huge data volumes\r\n\r\nAnd I'm not gonna just stop there, with Spring Batch in place, we'll be able to distribute our batch job workloads into separate JVMs in a scenario where we want to run a cluster of Fineract instances to cope with the load.\r\n\r\nThe next thing to the Spring Batch module integration is the introduction of a new batch job, Loan Close Of Business; that'll be the starting point of reworking the date handling in Fineract. This job will be simply responsible to \"close\" Loans on a daily basis making sure that interests/fees/etc are calculated properly. It's going to be the first full-fledged job that'll be able to run in a partitioned mode on a cluster of JVMs and multiple threads.\r\n\r\nThe job will be rolled out as disabled by default so it won't interfere with any existing deployments but if somebody will need it's potential and business functionality, they can certainly enable it. Also, there's an extensive documentation I already wrote for this; right now it's in PR for some review and I'm gonna do a few additional modifications but you can check it out here: https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/2326\r\n\r\nI don't want to repeat everything that's in the PR so if you're curious be sure to check it.\r\n\r\nTL;DR; Spring Batch is going to be integrated into Fineract. A new batch job called Loan Close Of Business will be created along with some additional functionality that's described in the PR above.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nArnold\r\n```\r\n\r\nI apoligize for not creating the ticket and thanks for @taskain7 doing it on my behalf. :-)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/1193377686/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/1193377835","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/2437#issuecomment-1193377835","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/2437","id":1193377835,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAuLPJ85HIYAr","user":{"login":"galovics","id":4701389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MDEzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4701389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/galovics","html_url":"https://github.com/galovics","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galovics/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galovics/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galovics/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galovics/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galovics/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galovics/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galovics/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galovics/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galovics/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-24T19:16:35Z","updated_at":"2022-07-24T19:16:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@avikganguly01 \r\n\r\n> Please hold this PR.

I can see @fynmanoj 's point with big PRs, but agree with @galovics that some features just cannot be chopped up in smaller pieces.\n\nConcerning cutting a release before merging this here: let's take a step back and look at what we are replacing (Quartz jobs)... I think it is safe to say that literally everyone has issues with the existing Quartz jobs... for myself I can say that I have at least one conversation on jobs per week.... and usually it's nothing positive. So my take on this would be to have the earlier the better (so, not only because of things rotting away in branches... which is still a valid point).\n\nAnd yes, there might be something to take care of to migrate a production system to a release with batch feature, but that's a fair price to pay for such a major improvement... we just have to document things properly.\n\n2 more cents","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/1195183127/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/1195247727","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/2437#issuecomment-1195247727","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/2437","id":1195247727,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAuLPJ85HPghv","user":{"login":"fynmanoj","id":56669674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NjY5Njc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56669674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fynmanoj","html_url":"https://github.com/fynmanoj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fynmanoj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fynmanoj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fynmanoj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fynmanoj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fynmanoj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fynmanoj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fynmanoj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fynmanoj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fynmanoj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-26T09:33:30Z","updated_at":"2022-07-26T09:59:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@galovics :\r\nThanks for your response, let me try to clarify what I meant above.\r\n\r\n> By `\"infra changes\"` \r\n\r\nI mean the major framework level changes that can affect the users and deployments. \r\n\r\n> Elaborate please.
