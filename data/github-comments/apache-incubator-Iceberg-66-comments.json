It is just generalized also for Flink (and any other use case that can accept a map).\r\n\r\n> Should a file io be created just for the json file and then a new file io be created for the other part of the table after reading the table properties? (manifest list/ manifest + data files?)\r\n\r\nThat is why FileIO is treated as a catalog property instead of a table property, to avoid this complication.\r\n \r\n> Where should the kms key id go? Is that a per table thing to write new data files (table properties) or is it a user/system defined property which should go in the arguments?\r\n\r\nWith the same reasoning as FileIO, if you put KMS key as a table property, then you need to create a table to know the KMS key, which needs to write to S3 and cause a circular dependency. \r\n\r\nI do agree there is a use case for one KMS key per table, that can be added in the future if there is such a request, with the KMS key in catalog property as default, and the one in table property as an override.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if these answer your question.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/742363762/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/742408491","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1850#issuecomment-742408491","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1850","id":742408491,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0MjQwODQ5MQ==","user":{"login":"massdosage","id":29457,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NDU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29457?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/massdosage","html_url":"https://github.com/massdosage","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massdosage/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massdosage/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massdosage/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massdosage/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massdosage/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massdosage/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massdosage/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massdosage/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massdosage/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-10T09:47:31Z","updated_at":"2020-12-10T09:47:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> @zhangdove: Thanks for bringing this up, and confirming the solution! @massdosage: do we want to clarify this in the doc?

What about the HMS Metastore properties (or any other information that is kept alongside the pointer to the iceberg table)?

The general problem being having multiple clean up tasks of any type. Instead, we typically would use multiple separate try-with-resources resource declarations or if you have more complex scenarios (returning a closeable only if several other operations succeed, each

Basically anywhere we user hadoop 2.7 libs. So this doesn't affect runtime.\r\n\r\n2. This occurs anywhere you try and use newer `javax.ws.rs` packages as Jersey1.9 sneakily has overlapping pacakges in `com.sun.jersey:jersey-client`. So i have seen this specifically when working w/ Nessie and Spark or Hive tests (in the iceberg repo or the Nessie repo). The Nessie client loads `javax` packages and hits a variation on `java.lang.AbstractMethodError: javax.ws.rs.core.UriBuilder.uri(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljavax/ws/rs/core/UriBuilder;`. This is a pre-cursor patch to some fixes to allow Nessie as a custom catalog in the hive reader.\r\n\r\nA quick check shows that Spark doesn't ship this old jersey (even though its a dep of hadoop 2.7) nor do some Hives. \r\n\r\nFrom my understanding the only thing this change does is allow us to use modern REST clients from unit tests and it will have no effect on runtime. I could take a more subtle approach and add an exclude for each test dependency if you prefer.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/743186804/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/743193351","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/1914#issuecomment-743193351","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1914","id":743193351,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0MzE5MzM1MQ==","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-11T13:30:00Z","updated_at":"2020-12-11T13:30:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Probably my comment would explain all your other issues - though I don't see type compatibility documentation for other engines yet.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/743193351/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/743200232","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/1911#issuecomment-743200232","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1911","id":743200232,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0MzIwMDIzMg==","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-11T13:44:57Z","updated_at":"2020-12-11T13:44:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I agree that it should be ideal to customize the file name format so that it could be customized against the internal of filesystem or external storage.

The problem here is that cleanup is being done in `finally` to avoid modifying the throwables that might be caught, and to ensure that the cleanup is always done, even if the `catch` cases change over time. Catching `Exception` means that it is annoyingly difficult thanks to checked exceptions to throw the exception that was caught.\r\n\r\nThe PR I opened solves that problem directly. I agree with the idea of using `AutoCloseable` and multiple try-with-resources, but this problem doesn't need multiple blocks. It looks like `RollbackCloseable` does something very similar to the pattern with the `threw` boolean, except that you'd normally use a separate try, which with the `runSafely` method isn't really needed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/743432878/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/743641137","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1919#issuecomment-743641137","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1919","id":743641137,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0MzY0MTEzNw==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-12T02:02:22Z","updated_at":"2020-12-12T02:02:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jun-he, could you look at this?

(I guess you can, but just to double check.)\r\n\r\nI don't know much about Flink itself, but it sounds odd if Flink SQL CLI (you meant CLI, not Flink SQL itself, right?) only works with standalone. I'd expect Flink SQL CLI to submit a job to the cluster and receive the output and print out, but well, I don't know.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/744771533/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/744772624","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1920#issuecomment-744772624","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1920","id":744772624,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0NDc3MjYyNA==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-14T23:09:41Z","updated_at":"2020-12-14T23:09:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 to the general approach.

One last thing to consider is whether we should do this in Hive or whether we should do this through serialization. If we do it in Hive, then we have code that touches `BaseTable` and does substitution.
