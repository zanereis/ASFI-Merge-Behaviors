for the feedback, I have made the changes requested, created an issue (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-2759), and added a dataStreamFiles to both SparkContext and JavaSparkContext which returns the DataInputStream itself (I have a feeling this might create a few more new issues with serialization or properly closing or rerunning tasks, but I guess we'll see). \n\nMy recommendation (as I have done in my own code) would be to use the abstract class `StreamBasedRecordReader` and implement an appropriate version for custom filetypes by implementing `def parseStream(inStream: DataInputStream): T`\n\nAs for PySpark it is my guess that is would be easiest to create a library of StreamBasedRecordReader classes for common file types since it is much less expensive to do IO on the Scala/Java level. Alternatively a Spark function could copy the file into a local directory on demand and provide the local filename to Python\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50700133/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50700224","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1643#issuecomment-50700224","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1643","id":50700224,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNzAwMjI0","user":{"login":"davies","id":40902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies","html_url":"https://github.com/davies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-31T00:44:14Z","updated_at":"2014-07-31T00:44:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I had tried these two approach, we have not easy way to get PIDs of workers, because it's platform dependent.

I had a conversation with @pwendell about this. We came to the conclusion that there is really no benefit from having a mechanism to specify an executor home, at least for standalone mode. Even if we have multiple installations of Spark on the worker machines, we can pick which one to connect to by simply specifying a different Master. In either case, we should just use the Worker's current working directory as the executor's (or driver's, in the case of standalone-cluster mode) Spark home.\n\nI will make the relevant changes shortly. If I don't get to it by the 1.1 code freeze, we should just merge in #1392 instead.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50700741/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50700807","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1499#issuecomment-50700807","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1499","id":50700807,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNzAwODA3","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-31T00:54:10Z","updated_at":"2014-07-31T00:54:10Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA tests have started for PR 1499.

I think the previous issue is that:\n\n``` scala\nimplicit val keyCmd: Manifest[U] = implicitly[Manifest[AnyRef]].asInstanceOf[Manifest[U]]\n```\n\nThis line of code cannot actually get the correct runtime class, the runtime class of `keyCmd` is `Object` as [SPARK-2103](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-2103) mentioned.\n\nBecause we only got `Object`, so create through reflection will get exception is this line:\n\n``` scala\nval keyDecoder = manifest[U].runtimeClass.getConstructor(classOf[VerifiableProperties])\n```\n\nThe right way is like this:\n\n``` scala\nimplicit val keyCmd: Manifest[U] = Manifest.classType(keyDecodeClass)\n```\n\nManifest can also do the same thing if we correctly feed it with class info. But I think it would be better to change Manifest to ClassTag to keep align with other code, so I changed to use ClassTag.\n\nI will add this to Mima exclude.\n\nThanks a lot.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50702546/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50702692","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1508#issuecomment-50702692","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1508","id":50702692,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNzAyNjky","user":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-31T01:26:47Z","updated_at":"2014-07-31T01:26:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I get it now.

So the simple way is to sleep for several seconds after `ssc.start()` and then feed the data.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50703510/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50703601","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1508#issuecomment-50703601","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1508","id":50703601,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNzAzNjAx","user":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-31T01:42:55Z","updated_at":"2014-07-31T01:42:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Jenkins, test this please. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50703601/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50703783","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/557#issuecomment-50703783","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/557","id":50703783,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNzAzNzgz","user":{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-31T01:46:03Z","updated_at":"2014-07-31T01:46:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I will create another PR, thanks a lot.
