Currently I have the LAPACK flag turned on in the build configuration, I build a project successfully, and later at runtime I notice that in fact LAPACK wasn't linked.  I then have to search through the source for references to the LAPACK variable to find that it is silently turned off without logging in the Makefile.  This seems to be the case with LAPACK but with no other linked library, and I'm not sure what the cause for the inconsistent behaviour is here.  I would actually prefer to get a linker error so that I know something is wrong.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/333482834/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/333499947","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/4469#issuecomment-333499947","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/4469","id":333499947,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMzQ5OTk0Nw==","user":{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-02T10:43:40Z","updated_at":"2017-10-02T10:43:40Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"As we've discussed, it builds on osx for cpu, but not gpu.
