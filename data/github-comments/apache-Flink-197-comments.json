And then a UDF that crosses the lists. \r\n\r\nI think this is how you would need to do it in SQL (you could use UNNEST to do the Cartesian product). The Table API could have a syntactic shortcut for that but the internal logical representation would again be the same. \r\n\r\nNot sure if it adds much value.

I read the design doc again, the original idea to support this functionality was doing minimal changes in the current state.  \r\nYes, currently a TableSink's schema is always derived from the query result, and before it is configured the schema is null. Practically, I found that we can overwrite the getOutputType method to declare a concrete sink table's schema, and this can be used in a dml sql validation.\r\n So without adding an new SinkTable or modifying TableSink interface, we can choose keeping  writeToSink() method in TableAPI as a usage of derive table and tell users they can implement a custom type TableSink with output type declaration as a predefined schema.\r\nI'm not sure if we should add a new method like 'sqlInsert' for dml insert sql, and uncertain about the return type of an insert Operatoin in Flink(Calcite's TableModify defines output for DML(INSERT,DELETE,UPDATE) is a RowCount column of BigInt type).

However, I think mixing these modes obfuscates the interface and means that the way how a `TableSink` can be used (with registration or without) depends on its implementation. IMO, a (correctly implemented) `TableSink` should be usable at any place where it can be passed to the Table API. From my point of view mixing both modes in the same interface would be bad API design. Actually, I think the registration mode of defining the schema before is very valuable because it ensures that the output of the query has a correct schema.\r\n\r\nRegarding the method of how to specify the query, I'm very much in favor of providing a separate method. I don't care so much about the name, `sqlInsert()` is just a proposal. However, I think the usage of a  `SELECT` query is completely different from an `INSERT INTO SELECT` query. This is reflected by the different return type and the need to provide a `QueryConfig`.\r\n\r\nBest, Fabian","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/315718525/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/315726238","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4324#issuecomment-315726238","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4324","id":315726238,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNTcyNjIzOA==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-17T11:07:49Z","updated_at":"2017-07-17T11:07:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @hongyuhong, thanks for your feedback!\r\nI agree, passing good error messages to users is important. However, this is very difficult in the optimizer because the optimizer is exploring different paths. If we throw an exception in the optimizer, we would kill the exploration and miss a valid plan. That's why I'm very hesitant to throw exceptions in rules. However, if the optimizer does not find a valid execution plan, it quits with an error message that tells the user that no valid plan could be found but does not point to a particular problem (such as an invalid join condition). \r\n\r\nA good solution for this is still needed.

Some sources don't get state, so they think that we are starting from scratch and they will run partition discovery.

Now, parallel instance 1 will still read from partition 0, parallel instance 2 will think that it didn't restart (because it didn't get state) and will discover partitions and take ownership of partition 1.\r\n\r\n(This is with current `release-1.3` branch code.)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/315805768/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/315820618","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4301#issuecomment-315820618","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4301","id":315820618,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNTgyMDYxOA==","user":{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-17T17:19:06Z","updated_at":"2017-07-17T17:19:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Oye, this is more complicated than I thought. On `release-1.3` the assignment actually works if the Kafka brokers always return the partitions in the same order. The reason is that the assignment of partitions and the assignment of operator state (in `RoundRobinOperatorStateRepartitioner`) is aligned. This meant that it's not a problem when sources think that they are \"fresh\" (not restored from state) because they didn't get any state. If they tried to assign a partition to themselves this would also mean that they have the state for that (again, because partition assignment and operator state assignment are aligned). \r\n\r\nThis PR breaks the alignment because the `startIndex` is not necessarily `0`. However, this is not caught by any tests because the `StateAssignmentOperation` has an optimisation where it doesn't repartition operator state if the parallelism doesn't change. If we deactivate that optimisation by turning this line into `if (true)`: https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/b1f762127234e323b947aa4a363935f87be1994f/flink-runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/runtime/checkpoint/StateAssignmentOperation.java#L561-L561 the test in Kafka09ITCase will fail.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to properly forward the information of whether we're restored in `initializeState()`, I did a commit for that: https://github.com/aljoscha/flink/tree/finish-pr-4301-kafka-13-fixings. The problem is that it is not easy to change the tests to catch this bug. I think an ITCase that uses Kafka and does a savepoint and rescaling would do the trick. (Something like `StatefulJobSavepointFrom13MigrationITCase` but doing the savepoint/restore in one test instead of storing it.)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/315820618/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/315828548","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4136#issuecomment-315828548","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4136","id":315828548,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNTgyODU0OA==","user":{"login":"bowenli86","id":1892692,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTI2OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1892692?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bowenli86","html_url":"https://github.com/bowenli86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bowenli86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bowenli86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bowenli86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bowenli86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bowenli86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bowenli86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bowenli86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bowenli86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bowenli86/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-17T17:46:43Z","updated_at":"2017-07-17T17:46:43Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@zentol

can you modify it or do you want me to add the sub-jiras for the cases you mentioned?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/315983449/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/315983578","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4324#issuecomment-315983578","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4324","id":315983578,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNTk4MzU3OA==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-18T07:38:41Z","updated_at":"2017-07-18T07:38:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Merging.\r\n\r\nI'll open a JIRA to discuss how to pass error messages to users.\r\n\r\nThanks @hongyuhong and @wuchong!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/315983578/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/315983613","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4325#issuecomment-315983613","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4325","id":315983613,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNTk4MzYxMw==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-18T07:38:48Z","updated_at":"2017-07-18T07:38:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Merging","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/315983613/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/315984532","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4076#issuecomment-315984532","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4076","id":315984532,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNTk4NDUzMg==","user":{"login":"twalthr","id":5746567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDY1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5746567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr","html_url":"https://github.com/twalthr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-18T07:42:59Z","updated_at":"2017-07-18T07:42:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @sunjincheng121.
