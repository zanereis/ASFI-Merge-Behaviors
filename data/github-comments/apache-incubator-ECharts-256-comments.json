See [demo here](https://codepen.io/Ovilia/pen/BayJRPg).\r\nThe clipPath position in under global coordinate, but the element is transformed so it doesn't behave as expected.\r\nIn order to fix this, we need to create a group element for each transformed element with clipPath and set the clipPath on the group while the element itself is transformed.\r\nWe cannot find an easy way to fix this by now, so it's marked to be fixed later.\r\n\r\n这个问题是由于同时使用 transform 和 clipPath 的元素引起的。\r\n我们期望 clipPath 的位置是相对于全局的，但 SVG 中如果将 clipPath 作用于一个 transform 过的元素，它实际是相对于元素的。因此，最后计算出的位置不符合预期。\r\n修复的方法可以是为每个带 transform 和 clipPath 的元素新建一个 group 元素，将 transform 作用于图形本身，将 clipPath 设置在 group 元素上。\r\n修复成本较高，考虑在 zrender 重构之后再修复这个问题，所以先标记为 TBD 了。","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/571037185/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/571038719","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/11980#issuecomment-571038719","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/11980","id":571038719,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MTAzODcxOQ==","user":{"login":"echarts-bot[bot]","id":45089189,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDUwODkxODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/20872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/echarts-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-06T07:44:00Z","updated_at":"2020-01-06T07:44:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue is not created using [issue template](https://ecomfe.github.io/echarts-issue-helper/) so I'm going to close it. 🙊\nSorry for this, but it helps save our maintainers' time so that more developers get helped.\nFeel free to create another issue using the issue template.\n\nIf you think you have already made your point clear without the template, or your problem cannot be covered by it, you may re-open this issue again.\n\n这个 issue 未使用 [issue 模板](https://ecomfe.github.io/echarts-issue-helper/?lang=zh-cn) 创建，所以我将关闭此 issue。\n为此带来的麻烦我深表歉意，但是请理解这是为了节约社区维护者的时间，以更高效地服务社区的开发者群体。\n如果您愿意，可以请使用 issue 模板重新创建 issue。\n\n如果你认为虽然没有使用模板，但你已经提供了复现问题的充分描述，或者你的问题无法使用模板表达，也可以重新 open 这个 issue。","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/571038719/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/571039564","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/11981#issuecomment-571039564","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/11981","id":571039564,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MTAzOTU2NA==","user":{"login":"echarts-bot[bot]","id":45089189,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDUwODkxODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/20872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/echarts-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-06T07:47:11Z","updated_at":"2020-01-06T07:47:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi!

We committed to echarts expecting such a critical issue to be resolved fairly quickly, but #7002 was reported more than 2 years ago and there seems to be no progress.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/571731262/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/571733975","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/11135#issuecomment-571733975","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/11135","id":571733975,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MTczMzk3NQ==","user":{"login":"ergouser","id":1202439,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDI0Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1202439?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ergouser","html_url":"https://github.com/ergouser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ergouser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ergouser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ergouser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ergouser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ergouser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ergouser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ergouser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ergouser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ergouser/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-07T19:26:39Z","updated_at":"2020-01-07T19:47:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"We - [ErgoTech](http://ergotech.com) - would really like to release our product with ECharts charts, but the memory leaks (#10130, #9437, #8988, #7002) are absolute blockers for us.  They mean you cannot create any application that needs to create dynamic charts in an application where the browser or computer are not being restarted on a regular basis.  For us, the application must run without issue for months at a time, with charts refreshing every few seconds, and can't because of these issues.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/571733975/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":3,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/571859781","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/10130#issuecomment-571859781","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/10130","id":571859781,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MTg1OTc4MQ==","user":{"login":"pissang","id":841551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MTU1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/841551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pissang","html_url":"https://github.com/pissang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pissang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pissang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pissang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pissang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pissang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pissang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pissang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pissang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pissang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-08T02:11:47Z","updated_at":"2020-01-08T02:12:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @ergouser Can you create a new issue and provide your reproducible demo to us?
