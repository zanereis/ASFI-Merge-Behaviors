Even without the component policy, I'm able to view the provenance event. This is the behavior I was expecting to see following the discussion on the JIRA. It's possible that we're using the same language to refer to different things. Let me try to elaborate/clarify a bit here.\r\n\r\n/processors/1234 - component policy (controls access to a component and its config)\r\n/provenance-data/processors/1234 - comopnent provenance event policy (controls access to the provenance events from a component)\r\n/data/processors/1234 - component data policy (controls access to the data from a component including flowfile attributes)\r\n\r\nThe line you referenced should only verify access to the component provenance event (and it appears that's how it's working). It should not be checking the component policy. My suggestion was to additionally check the component policy prior to populating the component details (`setComponentDetails`). This would be in line with your initial comment on this JIRA.\r\n\r\nWith your most recent changes, I'm not sure its functionality is different than before. It seems that it would be impossible to get a non-summarized event without permissions to the data of the component. I think we only need to verify permissions to data of a component for the attributes and the content specific fields. Other fields should be ok, allowing for a non-summarized event for folks without access to a component's data.\r\n\r\nIt appears that `checkAuthorizationForReplay` was also verifying that the connection that would be replayed into still exists. This would affect the availability of the replay action. Also, while a little nit-picky, I would also suggest using the `checkAuthorization...` methods which return an `AuthorizationResult` instead of relying on an `Exception` during a non-exceptional case. The generation of the stack trace is an expensive operation.\r\n\r\nAlso, it does not seem like you updated or replied to my comment regarding the need to include the flowfile attributes when authorizing access to component's provenance events. I think these are only necessary when authorizing access to a component's data.\r\n\r\nPlease do not squash additional commits. It makes it difficult to review when I cannot easily see the incremental changes. \r\n\r\nThanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/395490424/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/395502132","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2770#issuecomment-395502132","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2770","id":395502132,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NTUwMjEzMg==","user":{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-07T17:30:00Z","updated_at":"2018-06-07T17:30:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"For those reviewing, the simplest way to verify the fix is to create a DebugFlow processor. Set the \"CustomValidate Pause Time\" property to \"70 millis\" and when you apply the update, you should see the component is validating (it's possible that validation will complete before the 50 ms timeout due to java timing precision - if this happens, just configure processor and click \"Apply\" again). Change the duration to 25 millis and you should no longer see the validation occurring. Of course, because of timing issues you may see some variance.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/395502132/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/395514082","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2771#issuecomment-395514082","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2771","id":395514082,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NTUxNDA4Mg==","user":{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-07T18:10:16Z","updated_at":"2018-06-07T18:10:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mcgilman thanks, was able to verify that the logic makes sense, all looks good. +1 merged to master.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/395514082/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/395530444","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2711#issuecomment-395530444","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2711","id":395530444,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NTUzMDQ0NA==","user":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-07T19:03:53Z","updated_at":"2018-06-07T19:03:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 LGTM, thanks all for the reviews and @joetrite for the new feature!

I don't think this is really the approach that we want to take here, though. What our interface provides currently is a mechanism to pass in the 'coordinates', i.e., the location for finding the data that we want. The approach here takes this concepts and muddies it by providing arbitrary key/value pairs that don't make sense for the lookup.\r\n\r\nI would propose an alternative approach, which would be to add a new method to the interface that has a default implementation:\r\n```\r\ndefault Optional<T> lookup(Map<String, Object> coordinates, Map<String, String> context) throws LookupFailureException {\r\n    return lookup(coordinates);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWhere `context` is used for the FlowFile attributes (I'm referring to it as `context` instead of `attributes` because there may well be a case where we want to provide some other value that is not specifically a FlowFile attribute). Here is why I am suggesting this:\r\n- It provides a clean interface that properly separates the data's coordinates from FlowFile attributes.\r\n- It prevents any collisions between FlowFile attribute names and coordinates.\r\n- It maintains backward compatibility, and we know that it won't change the behavior of existing services or processors/components using those services - even those that may have been implemented by others outside of the Apache realm.\r\n- If attributes are passed in by a Processor, those attributes will be ignored anyway unless the Controller Service is specifically updated to make use of those attributes, such as via Expression Language. In such a case, the Controller Service can simply be updated at that time to make use of the new method instead of the existing method.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/396257733/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/396258572","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2773#issuecomment-396258572","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2773","id":396258572,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NjI1ODU3Mg==","user":{"login":"mcgilman","id":123395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzM5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman","html_url":"https://github.com/mcgilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-11T14:15:00Z","updated_at":"2018-06-11T14:15:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@zenfenan Correct.

The new way can clearly go far faster than 2x the old way.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/396259021/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/396264363","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2588#issuecomment-396264363","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2588","id":396264363,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NjI2NDM2Mw==","user":{"login":"ottobackwards","id":1111551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTE1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards","html_url":"https://github.com/ottobackwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-11T14:31:36Z","updated_at":"2018-06-11T14:31:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@joewitt requested changes are in","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/396264363/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/396270266","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2588#issuecomment-396270266","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2588","id":396270266,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NjI3MDI2Ng==","user":{"login":"joewitt","id":3057465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTc0NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3057465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt","html_url":"https://github.com/joewitt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-11T14:48:27Z","updated_at":"2018-06-11T14:48:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"full clean build w/contrib check passes.\r\nreview of code all seems ok and no new dep issues\r\nlicense and notice updates correct/header changes.\r\n\r\nMy review was more legal/structural than functional.

Separating the coordinate and context make sense and implementations will be cleaner by doing so. Although I agree with the idea, let me try to explain why I wanted to put everything into the same map.\r\n\r\nI wanted to muddle all variables into the same map because some lookup target, such as URL for the RestLookupService have both lookup coordinate and environment depending part that can be passed as FlowFile attributes or variable registry.\r\n\r\nFor example, let's say we want to make following URL to be populated by a Expression Language to be used by RestLookupService. `http://test.example.com:8080/service/john.smith/friend/12345`\r\nI think the URL has both lookup and contextual part in it.\r\n\r\n- `john.smith and `12345` are lookup coordinates that vary from input, in LookupRecord context, it varies per recocrd\r\n- But hostname and port is more of contextual values, that varies per FlowFile or environment\r\n\r\nIf the URL property is configured as `http://${apiHost}:${apiPort}/service/${userName}/friend/${friendId}`, and if it can only refer lookup coordinate, then `apiHost` and `apiPort` need to be set for each record lookup. And to do so, user need to configure dynamic properties at LookupRecord processor using record paths, which can be awkward since RecordPathValidator doesn't allow literal String value. A work-around is to use `concat('test.example.com')` to return the constant value for every record lookup.\r\n\r\nTo make this scenario more flexible while meeting with the idea of separating lookup coordinates and context, I wrote MikeThomsen/nifi#1  so that target URL can be configured by 2 properties (if necessary). `BASE_URL` can use Variable Registry, and `URL` can use coordinate.\r\n\r\nIf we pursue the path to separate lookup and coordinate more implementations like that will be needed in different places. That has both pros / cons I think. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the variables those can be referred by an EL is already muddled a lot IMHO. It contains System properties, Variable registry, and FlowFile attribute values and EL can utilize those without knowing where it's configured.\r\n\r\nAdding those values into lookup coordinate may not sound that wrong, if we keep the consistent overlaying order.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/396512384/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/396550108","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2777#issuecomment-396550108","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2777","id":396550108,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NjU1MDEwOA==","user":{"login":"MikeThomsen","id":108184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODE4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen","html_url":"https://github.com/MikeThomsen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-12T10:58:58Z","updated_at":"2018-06-12T10:58:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ijokarumawak \r\n\r\n> Adding those values into lookup coordinate may not sound that wrong, if we keep the consistent overlaying order.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, dangerous to do with LookupService implementations that are based around query builders like the Mongo one.

By introducing the `Map<String, String> context` and providing a default implementation in the interface, all existing services will work as they previously did, and all existing processors will work as the previously did.

If so, how can we do that?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/396603634/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/396611549","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2777#issuecomment-396611549","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2777","id":396611549,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NjYxMTU0OQ==","user":{"login":"ottobackwards","id":1111551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTE1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards","html_url":"https://github.com/ottobackwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-12T14:32:56Z","updated_at":"2018-06-12T14:32:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@markap14 that certainly makes sense, thanks for taking the time to respond","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/396611549/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/396613905","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2777#issuecomment-396613905","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2777","id":396613905,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NjYxMzkwNQ==","user":{"login":"ijokarumawak","id":1107620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak","html_url":"https://github.com/ijokarumawak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-12T14:39:41Z","updated_at":"2018-06-12T14:39:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"As for Variable Registry, I think passing only FlowFile attribute is enough, same as the way AbstractRecordProcessor is doing right now. https://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/master/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-standard-bundle/nifi-standard-processors/src/main/java/org/apache/nifi/processors/standard/AbstractRecordProcessor.java#L113\r\n\r\nIn that sense, I found a contradiction between current documentation and behavior.

The updated NiFi can access Couchbase 4.x and 5.x.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/396781410/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/396792869","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2785#issuecomment-396792869","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2785","id":396792869,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5Njc5Mjg2OQ==","user":{"login":"alopresto","id":798465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODQ2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/798465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto","html_url":"https://github.com/alopresto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-13T02:23:32Z","updated_at":"2018-06-13T02:23:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I discussed with @pvillard31 and we are going to hold off on merging this for right now. Here is what I wrote on the Jira:\r\n\r\n> Pierre Villard can you describe the use case where you feel VR EL support is necessary for these fields? I am guessing you want to be able to specify a keystore and truststore path in the VR and allow an SSLContextService to reference it. I have a couple concerns with this approach:\r\n> \r\n> It allows any user with variable permissions to see the path to the keystore and truststore. In the current setup, the controller service can be deployed with literal paths by an administrator/trusted user, and the service can be referenced by dependent components without exposing the actual file system paths to a less-trusted user (given the proper absence of permissions on the controller service). Currently, a user who does not have view permission to the StandardSSLContextService cannot see the explicit path at all, even if they have view permission to the referencing InvokeHTTP processor (for example). In this new scenario, they would be able to see the explicit path in the Variables window, and see the UUID of the referencing SSLCS (see https://nifi.apache.org/docs/nifi-docs/html/user-guide.html#unauthorized-referencing-components)\r\n> It allows the keystore and truststore path to change without visibility on the configuration dialog. Given EL evaluation, the processor will evaluate not only VR-specific variables, but also system properties and OS-level environment variables. This means that a malicious or incidental occurrence could change the path used to locate the keystore and truststore without the NiFi user being aware\r\n> The original work that introduced the unit tests you reference was done in NIFI-4274 because of a Stack Overflow question where the documentation (which said EL was not supported) and the behavior (incorrectly evaluating EL) did not match.\r\n> \r\n> I appreciate the work you put into this PR. If you have a specific use case that really requires this behavior, let's discuss it. If this is just to bring these properties inline with the baseline EL evaluation, I would ask that we do not implement this at this time.\r\n> \r\n> There is some ongoing work/discussion about how to handle the sensitive properties in conjunction with the VR, Registry, flow versioning, setting from external sources, etc. and I believe it requires a cohesive approach with substantial threat modeling to avoid introducing serious issues into NiFi. We have traditionally held to a \"secure but severe\" policy where some features are absent because of the strict principle that \"sensitive properties are always protected/blocked\". It may be time to re-evaluate that, but introducing these changes piecemeal is dangerous in my opinion.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/396792869/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/396798028","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2686#issuecomment-396798028","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2686","id":396798028,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5Njc5ODAyOA==","user":{"login":"mans2singh","id":8467404,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0Njc0MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8467404?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh","html_url":"https://github.com/mans2singh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-13T02:57:26Z","updated_at":"2018-06-13T02:59:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ijokarumawak - I was thinking that the processor will be used as a transformer (predictor) and there would be a correlation attribute in the flow file which would be used to associate the results with the observations.
