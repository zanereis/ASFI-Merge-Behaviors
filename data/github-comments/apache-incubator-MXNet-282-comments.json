This time , I change to another GPU EC2 called p2.xlarge. Anyway , this change would not make big difference.\r\n#[the cpu usage pic](https://share.weiyun.com/324107260459aa96240ad475577d419c)\r\n#[the gpu usage pic](https://share.weiyun.com/38c9f8703edb1e71c7308ad9f9026435)\r\nAs you can see , there are 6 threads running this script, one shows 101---I guess it means  over 100% usage?     And without exception, the gpu usage is still low. \r\n\r\nand on contrary, running the mnist example below would give over 50% of GPU usage, and it really depends on batch_size:\r\n```\r\nimport mxnet as mx\r\n\r\nimport  argparse\r\ndef parse_args(description):\r\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=description)\r\n    parser.add_argument('--batch_size', dest='batch_size', type=int, default=8)\r\n    parser.add_argument('--train_exp_num', dest='train_exp_num', type=int, default=2000)\r\n    parser.add_argument('--epoch_num', dest='epoch_num', type=int, default=50)\r\n    parser.add_argument('--gpu_num', dest='gpu_num', type=int, default=1)\r\n    parser.add_argument('--lr', dest='lr', type=float, default=0.00075)\r\n\r\n    args = parser.parse_args()\r\n    return args\r\n\r\n\r\nif __name__ == '__main__':\r\n    args=parse_args('for mnist')\r\n    mnist = mx.test_utils.get_mnist()\r\n\r\n    batch_size =args.batch_size #100\r\n    train_iter = mx.io.NDArrayIter(mnist['train_data'], mnist['train_label'], batch_size, shuffle=True)\r\n    val_iter = mx.io.NDArrayIter(mnist['test_data'], mnist['test_label'], batch_size)\r\n\r\n    data = mx.sym.var('data')\r\n    # first conv layer\r\n    conv1 = mx.sym.Convolution(data=data, kernel=(5, 5), num_filter=20)\r\n    tanh1 = mx.sym.Activation(data=conv1, act_type=\"tanh\")\r\n    pool1 = mx.sym.Pooling(data=tanh1, pool_type=\"max\", kernel=(2, 2), stride=(2, 2))\r\n    # second conv layer\r\n    conv2 = mx.sym.Convolution(data=pool1, kernel=(5, 5), num_filter=50)\r\n    tanh2 = mx.sym.Activation(data=conv2, act_type=\"tanh\")\r\n    pool2 = mx.sym.Pooling(data=tanh2, pool_type=\"max\", kernel=(2, 2), stride=(2, 2))\r\n    # first fullc layer\r\n    flatten = mx.sym.flatten(data=pool2)\r\n    fc1 = mx.symbol.FullyConnected(data=flatten, num_hidden=500)\r\n    tanh3 = mx.sym.Activation(data=fc1, act_type=\"tanh\")\r\n    # second fullc\r\n    fc2 = mx.sym.FullyConnected(data=tanh3, num_hidden=10)\r\n    # softmax loss\r\n    lenet = mx.sym.SoftmaxOutput(data=fc2, name='softmax')\r\n\r\n    import logging\r\n\r\n    logging.getLogger().setLevel(logging.DEBUG)  # logging to stdout\r\n    # create a trainable module on GPU 0\r\n    lenet_model = mx.mod.Module(symbol=lenet, context=mx.gpu())\r\n    # train with the same\r\n    lenet_model.fit(train_iter,\r\n                    eval_data=val_iter,\r\n                    optimizer='sgd',\r\n                    optimizer_params={'learning_rate': 0.1},\r\n                    eval_metric='acc',\r\n                    batch_end_callback=mx.callback.Speedometer(batch_size, 100),\r\n                    num_epoch=10)\r\n\r\n```\r\nSo I wonder how to make full usage of gpu? As far as I know, that increasing batch_size is useful--- but not for my script.\r\nAnd as the gpu usage often  fluctuates from 0 to 19 in no time. I guess whether  it is due to my dataiter  creating data for every batch at real time ?   If this is the problem, how to fix it?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/351062486/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/351066182","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/8936#issuecomment-351066182","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/8936","id":351066182,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MTA2NjE4Mg==","user":{"login":"nicolasjamet","id":16217402,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjE3NDAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16217402?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolasjamet","html_url":"https://github.com/nicolasjamet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolasjamet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolasjamet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolasjamet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolasjamet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolasjamet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolasjamet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolasjamet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolasjamet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolasjamet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-12T14:25:49Z","updated_at":"2017-12-12T14:25:49Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Any

From what I have seen in the past from great test engineers it that they keep the config in jenkins to a minimum and directly call a script.  I don't like all kinds of flags and config in the Jenkins configuration, for starters because it's harder to reproduce when you build in the platform by yourself to fix issues. (As a developer I don't want to specify all these flags when building).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/351128643/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/351130522","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/9035#issuecomment-351130522","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9035","id":351130522,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MTEzMDUyMg==","user":{"login":"larroy","id":928489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyODQ4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/928489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy","html_url":"https://github.com/larroy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-12T17:51:02Z","updated_at":"2017-12-12T17:51:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I actually was thinking of having a build.json file with all the flags that can be easily modified.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/351130522/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/351143893","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/9001#issuecomment-351143893","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9001","id":351143893,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MTE0Mzg5Mw==","user":{"login":"rahul003","id":3457240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTcyNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3457240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003","html_url":"https://github.com/rahul003","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-12T18:30:49Z","updated_at":"2017-12-12T18:30:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Please consider merging.
