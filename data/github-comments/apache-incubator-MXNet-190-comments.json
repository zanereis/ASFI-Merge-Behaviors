colorful. Here, the related colors are \"mixed\" to signify blend of:\r\n    i) Symbolic and Imperative programming paradigms, \r\n    ii) Synchronous and Asynchronous execution models, \r\n    iii) CPU and GPU processor support, and\r\n    iv) beautiful overlap of Computation and Communication in a Distributed System.\r\n\r\n2) The Logo signifies some \"deep\" meaning. Here the fully \"open\" Lotus signifies rising and blooming above the complexity murk using the open-source, flexible and efficient Apache MXNet library to achieve an \"enlightenment\" of Deep Learning.\r\n\r\n3) The Logo uses blue color for MXNet to match its web-site background color.\r\n\r\n4) The Logo is distinguishable on a T-shirt from far or by a person not wearing his spectacles, making it easy to notice and remember the logo for the long-term.\r\n\r\n5) The Logo is easy to draw on a white-board during MXNet training lectures.\r\n\r\nYou can design many such alternative logos for free at https://www.logomaker.com and then pay $40 for a high-quality image file once the design is confirmed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/299665335/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":1,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/299669040","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/6103#issuecomment-299669040","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/6103","id":299669040,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5OTY2OTA0MA==","user":{"login":"lryta","id":8669478,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2Njk0Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8669478?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lryta","html_url":"https://github.com/lryta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lryta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lryta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lryta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lryta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lryta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lryta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lryta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lryta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lryta/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-06T22:13:15Z","updated_at":"2017-05-06T22:13:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@nswamy  The background is awesome!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/299669040/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/299684901","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/5502#issuecomment-299684901","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/5502","id":299684901,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5OTY4NDkwMQ==","user":{"login":"praveen7728","id":9313237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzMTMyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9313237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/praveen7728","html_url":"https://github.com/praveen7728","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praveen7728/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praveen7728/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praveen7728/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praveen7728/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praveen7728/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praveen7728/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praveen7728/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praveen7728/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praveen7728/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-07T06:14:39Z","updated_at":"2017-05-07T06:14:39Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I am facing the same problem.
