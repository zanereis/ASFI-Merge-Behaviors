I would like to allocate only a 32x128 shared memory and reuse it four times per tile.  In addition, I want to pad 8 data every two tile rows to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory with storage_align.  I expect C.shared (the local ->shared stage) does exactly 256x256 copying, but the following IR shows 4 times of that.\r\n\r\n    // attr [C.local] storage_scope = \"local\"\r\n    allocate C.local[float16 * 65536]\r\n    // attr [C.shared] storage_scope = \"shared\"\r\n    allocate C.shared[float16 * 16896]\r\n    for (n.c, 0, 256) {\r\n      for (m.c, 0, 256) {\r\n        C.local[((n.c*256) + m.c)] = A[((n.c*256) + m.c)]\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    for (n.outer, 0, 2) {\r\n      for (m.outer, 0, 2) {\r\n        for (n.inner.outer, 0, 4) {\r\n          for (n.inner.outer.c, 0, 64) {\r\n            for (n.inner.inner.m.inner.fused.c, 0, 256) {\r\n              C.shared[((n.inner.outer.c*264) + n.inner.inner.m.inner.fused.c)] = C.local[(((((n.outer*32768) + (n.inner.outer.c*512)) + (floordiv(n.inner.inner.m.inner.fused.c, 128)*256)) + (m.outer*128)) + floormod(n.inner.inner.m.inner.fused.c, 128))]\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n          for (n.inner.inner, 0, 32) {\r\n            for (m.inner, 0, 128) {\r\n              C[(((((n.outer*32768) + (n.inner.outer*8192)) + (n.inner.inner*256)) + (m.outer*128)) + m.inner)] = C.shared[((((n.inner.outer*4224) + (floordiv(n.inner.inner, 2)*264)) + (floormod(n.inner.inner, 2)*128)) + m.inner)]\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n            \r\nIf there is another schedule to achieve this, please let me know.  As of now, I can only accomplish this by tiling both C.shared and C.  C's compute now involves several floormod: `C.shared(floordiv(n, 128), floordiv(m, 128), floordiv(floormod(n, 128), 2), ((floormod(floormod(n, 128), 2)*128) + floormod(m, 128)))`.  `m` and `n` further bring in leaf IterVars to floormod to PropBoundToInputs() during InferBound.  Because the best result from floormod(x, 128) is [0, 128-1], C.shared doesn't reduce domain, although it does compute_at s[C]'s n.inner.outer with range [0,3].\r\n\r\nWith this PR, I am able to get expected IR -- `(n.inner.outer.c, 0, 64)` becoming `(n.inner.outer.c, 0, 16)`:\r\n\r\n    // attr [C.local] storage_scope = \"local\"\r\n    allocate C.local[float16 * 65536]\r\n    // attr [C.shared] storage_scope = \"shared\"\r\n    allocate C.shared[float16 * 4224]\r\n    for (n.c, 0, 256) {\r\n      for (m.c, 0, 256) {\r\n        C.local[((n.c*256) + m.c)] = A[((n.c*256) + m.c)]\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    for (n.outer, 0, 2) {\r\n      for (m.outer, 0, 2) {\r\n        for (n.inner.outer, 0, 4) {\r\n          for (n.inner.outer.c, 0, 16) {\r\n            for (n.inner.inner.m.inner.fused.c, 0, 256) {\r\n              C.shared[((n.inner.outer.c*264) + n.inner.inner.m.inner.fused.c)] = C.local[((((((n.outer*32768) + (n.inner.outer*8192)) + (n.inner.outer.c*512)) + (floordiv(n.inner.inner.m.inner.fused.c, 128)*256)) + (m.outer*128)) + floormod(n.inner.inner.m.inner.fused.c, 128))]\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n          for (n.inner.inner, 0, 32) {\r\n            for (m.inner, 0, 128) {\r\n              C[(((((n.outer*32768) + (n.inner.outer*8192)) + (n.inner.inner*256)) + (m.outer*128)) + m.inner)] = C.shared[(((floordiv(n.inner.inner, 2)*264) + (floormod(n.inner.inner, 2)*128)) + m.inner)]\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nThe improvement has two folds:\r\n1.   EvalSet takes a range map as input to help calculating floormod.  For example:  `[x*4, x*4+3] % 8 = [x*4-x/2*8, x*4+3-(x*4+3)/8*8)]`, if we don't know `x`'s range; but `[x*4, x*4+3]`, if we know `x`'s range is `[0, 1]`.  This is common from tiling.\r\n      \r\n2.   For `a mod b`, if b is an IntImm, single point, and greater than 0, we do the following:\r\n\r\n    // a mod b = a - b * (a/b) if\r\n    // (a) a_max - a_min < b, i.e. that before mod, a's range doesn't cover [0, b)\r\n    // and (b) a_min mod b <= a_max mod b, i.e. that a's range is still continuous after mod\r\nso that `[13, 15] % 10 = [3, 5]`\r\n\r\nIntervalSet evaluation is hard.  These improvements are adhoc to the problems I encountered.  I am open to any alternatives.\r\n\r\nQuestion: how about mod?  It's implementation looks same as floormod.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/616035227/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/616037285","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/5362#issuecomment-616037285","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5362","id":616037285,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxNjAzNzI4NQ==","user":{"login":"anijain2305","id":13822661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODIyNjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13822661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305","html_url":"https://github.com/anijain2305","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-19T05:21:11Z","updated_at":"2020-04-19T05:21:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tqchen This tutorial requires `mxnet-mkl` package.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the CI failure is\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/sphinx_gallery/gen_rst.py\", line 480, in _memory_usage\r\n\r\n    out = func()\r\n\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/sphinx_gallery/gen_rst.py\", line 465, in __call__\r\n\r\n    exec(self.code, self.globals)\r\n\r\n  File \"/workspace/tutorials/frontend/deploy_prequantized_mxnet.py\", line 46, in <module>\r\n\r\n    from mxnet.contrib.quantization import quantize_model_mkldnn\r\n\r\nImportError: cannot import name 'quantize_model_mkldnn'\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nThere is no workaround here, I am using MXNet-MKL quantizer to quantize the model.\r\n\r\nIf we want to have this tutorial anyways, I can wrap the tutorial into a function and comment its invocation.

would be great if we can dissect it down to specific cases in mind and discuss how to solve these cases, I see two kinds of problems:\r\n\r\n- (1) EvalSet need to be aware of the bound of Vars\r\n   - Ideally these bounds should be populated in the analyzer via bind.\r\n- (2) `floormod([13, 15], 10) => [3, 5]` : This seems to be a clean case that we can fix first(independent from the Var bound problem), how about we create a separate PR for the var bound case and aim at fixing this one?\r\n   - For `floormod([a, b], c)`:  check if we can prove `floordiv(a, c) == floordiv(b, c)`, if so, we rewrite to `[a - floordiv(a, c) * c, b -  floordiv(b, c) * c]`, otherwise, follow the old rule.\r\n  - Same rule can be applied to

from the Var bound problem), how about we create a separate PR for the var bound case and aim at fixing this one?\r\n>   \r\n>   * For `floormod([a, b], c)`:  check if we can prove `floordiv(a, c) == floordiv(b, c)`, if so, we rewrite to `[a - floordiv(a, c) * c, b -  floordiv(b, c) * c]`, otherwise, follow the old rule.\r\n>   * Same rule can be applied to ConstIntBound\r\n\r\nThis is also how I
