this seems to cause Ignite to leak open files.\r\n\r\nDoing any of the above will ultimately cause a send message to another node to fail because it can't open a new socket connection but then wait indefinitely for a reply that will never happen because the original message wasn't sent. This then triggers the handshake timeout, the blocked system thread and then the restart handler to fail.\r\n\r\nKilling the node with a SIGTERM causes the node to log \"shutdown hook invoked\" and then nothing else and it never exits; only a SIGKILL will break the deadlock.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/comments/2020240927/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/comments/2020252642","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ignite/issues/11271#issuecomment-2020252642","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/11271","id":2020252642,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdkdzs54apvi","user":{"login":"daniverltd","id":11574665,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTc0NjY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11574665?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniverltd","html_url":"https://github.com/daniverltd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniverltd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniverltd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniverltd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniverltd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniverltd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniverltd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniverltd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniverltd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniverltd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-26T12:06:01Z","updated_at":"2024-03-26T12:06:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Oh, and the correct JIRA ticket link: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IGNITE-20940","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/comments/2020252642/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/comments/2026486825","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ignite/issues/11251#issuecomment-2026486825","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/11251","id":2026486825,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdkdzs54ybwp","user":{"login":"qybf","id":47775316,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Nzc1MzE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47775316?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qybf","html_url":"https://github.com/qybf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qybf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qybf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qybf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qybf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qybf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qybf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qybf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qybf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qybf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-29T02:18:26Z","updated_at":"2024-03-29T02:18:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> the error msg is here:\r\n> \r\n> 2024-02-03T07:00:43,787Z+0000|ERROR|checkpoint-runner-cpu-#91|Log4J2Logger#error:533|Critical system error detected.

If merged, it doesn't require additional fixes of broken extensions and any user code which uses `CdcConsumer` and internal `class MetricRegistry`. I belive, we should remove usages of the internals from `CdcConsumer` first. Then, rename new `interface IgniteMetricRegistry` -> `interface MetricRegistry`.
