I had to preserve the default behavior which uses the system properties, I know that people use it (recall multiple discussions around that). \r\n\r\nI introduced 2 new methods to `ClassUnwrapper`: `getRealClassFromClass` and `getRealObject`. I kept the name `getRealClassFromClass` (not the `getClassFromModel` as you suggested) because it looks to me that `ClassUnwrapper` should not really care about underlying model (CDI/Spring), but it could be used to back different models if needed (fe Annotated, BeanDefinition, ...). The `getRealObject` is outlier but really  needed to fully replace the `ClassHelper` functionality (it is a default method, no need to implement).\r\n\r\nRegarding  `CompositeClassUnwrapper ` it is absolutely possible now, I didn't introduce it yet since I just don't have use case at this moment. If PR looks good, we could build on top.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/479593978/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/479632076","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cxf/pull/529#issuecomment-479632076","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/529","id":479632076,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3OTYzMjA3Ng==","user":{"login":"rmannibucau","id":1249546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDk1NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1249546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau","html_url":"https://github.com/rmannibucau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-03T19:45:26Z","updated_at":"2019-04-03T19:45:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks good, worse case a default method would solve the model api issue.

I started out by making the tests fail in those unit tests. However I had to setup a pretty large amount of mocks and additional classes. To prove this you basically need to setup a complete entity reader that parses an input stream and eventually calls a method that was initialised wrongly with a null value. I managed to get quite far but the test looked more like a system test than a unit test.  Thinking about it again i concluded that the actual fix should be that the initialisation of the ReaderInterceptorMBR should just not accept a null value as message. So that is that actual fix with a associated unittest. The other new unittest do indeed not trigger on this error because it happens downstream in other flow, still i wrote them anyway so they might be useful to have. Long story short, the proof is the null check in the ReaderInterceptorMBR. I would be interested in adding a system test to prove that the entire chain works as designed now, but i would ask for some pointers on where to start.

@scsosna99 could you recheck the case using this impl?\r\n\r\nOur biggest contention appears to be in getCollectionContext(), where manipulating the collection blocks continually.  The solution that we've come up with is to use a ConcurrentHashMap and call putIfAbsent, which substantially reduces blockage\r\n\r\n I wanted to find a solution that kept this a Set - and had a better chance of passing your scrutiny - but blocking continues, synchronizing threads, impacting performance.  I thought using newKeySet() would get me what I needed but didn't; also tried ReentrantReadWriteLock to allow n-read/1-write.\r\n\r\nYour changes would affect other collections which aren't really impacting me, though I thought changing them to ConcurrentHashMap's would help reduce synchronization.\r\n\r\nChances are that all these changes give some general improvement but our hack works better.  Our one-off change is 2.6.11 running against Java7 (don't chastise me, I just started here!) so the JDK bug referenced above would need more research.  Longer-term goal is moving our services out of the monolith which will end up being Spring Boot and new problems arise....\r\n\r\nThanks all, but I'm going to drop this for now.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/553415102/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/554356816","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cxf/pull/597#issuecomment-554356816","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/597","id":554356816,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NDM1NjgxNg==","user":{"login":"scsosna99","id":28620719,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NjIwNzE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28620719?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scsosna99","html_url":"https://github.com/scsosna99","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scsosna99/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scsosna99/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scsosna99/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scsosna99/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scsosna99/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scsosna99/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scsosna99/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scsosna99/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scsosna99/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-15T13:23:34Z","updated_at":"2019-11-15T13:23:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"So I had my team member rerun his performance tests and the original changes I made are much better performing than originally thought.
