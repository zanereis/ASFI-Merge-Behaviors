\n\nI've revised the PR to avoid persisting null columns. \n\nIndexGeneratorJob and Sink have been changed to remember dimension orders outside of/across their individual indexes.\n\nI also added a change to IndexIO's v8 to v9 conversion function, I noticed in some testing/debugging that filtering on a null value would fail in some cases if I converted null dim values within dimension to empty

Just to avoid confusion on my side: My idea was not to create a new Druid extension, but instead to build a simple basic Java module (the term 'module' as in Maven module) containing all the shaded stuff. The core of Druid (and probably then also all extensions) would then have that java package as some simple build dependency. I assume that then this module would be present in the classloader of the Druid core stuff - or would there still be a problem?

We have vast experience with tuning Spark for different workloads, and we have lots of data to test it, so we might help get it fixed.\n\nThanks!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/165194174/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/165194517","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/2089#issuecomment-165194517","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2089","id":165194517,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NTE5NDUxNw==","user":{"login":"drcrallen","id":8213081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMTMwODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8213081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen","html_url":"https://github.com/drcrallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-16T17:56:27Z","updated_at":"2015-12-16T17:56:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@spektom Yep, getting you access.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/165194517/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/165202080","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/2089#issuecomment-165202080","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2089","id":165202080,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NTIwMjA4MA==","user":{"login":"drcrallen","id":8213081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMTMwODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8213081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen","html_url":"https://github.com/drcrallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-16T18:20:59Z","updated_at":"2015-12-16T18:20:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"By popular request, and since development is more on the spark side than the druid-extension side right now, I have made https://github.com/metamx/druid-spark-batch open to the public for general testing / alpha interest.\n\nI would _not_ consider it production ready yet, so please do not expect it to be free of corner cases or support easy upgrades.

have been thinking a little bit about solving the issue with some ClassLoader magic. One big issue here is that the mappers and reducers will be instantiated by Hadoop, of course the offending jars from Hadoop then are already present in the ClassLoader. \n\nSo one idea would be to implement \"delegating\" mapper and reducer classes, which first setup a properly build ClassLoader with Druid provided jars of the problematic classes. This ClassLoader would also need to be implemented such that it first looks into its own list of jars and then delegates to the parent class loader (I think the normal behaviour is the opposite way round). At least it should have a blacklist of classes which should not be delegated to its parent.\n\nThen those delegating mapper and reducer could instantiate the real Druid mapper and reducer using its special ClassLoader. The map/reduce methods of the encapsulting mapper/reducer then would delegate the work to the loaded mapper/reducer.\n\nAny thoughts about that? Does this make sense to anybody?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/165843607/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/165859179","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/2120#issuecomment-165859179","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2120","id":165859179,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NTg1OTE3OQ==","user":{"login":"fjy","id":428325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODMyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy","html_url":"https://github.com/fjy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-18T18:08:17Z","updated_at":"2015-12-18T18:08:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've
