Thanks a lot for this PR! Gather-Sum-Apply will be an awesome addition to Gelly ^^\nHere come my comments:\n- There's no need for Gather, Sum and Apply functions to implement MapFunction, FlatJoinFunction, etc., since they are wrapped inside those in GatherSumApplyIteration class. Actually, I would use the Rich\\* versions instead, so that we can have access to open() and close() methods. You can look at how `VertexCentricIteration` wraps the `VertexUpdateFunction` inside a `RichCoGroupFunction`.\n- With this small change above, we could also allow access to aggregators and broadcast sets. This must be straight-forward to add (again look at `VertexCentricIteration` for hints). We should also add `getName()`, `setName()`, `getParallelism()`, `setParallelism()` methods to `GatherSumApplyIteration`.\n- Finally, it'd be great if you could add the tests you have as examples, i.e. one for Greedy Graph Coloring and one for GSAShortestPaths.\n\nLet me know if you have any doubts!\n\nThanks again :sunny:\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/75249793/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/75254417","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/368#issuecomment-75254417","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/368","id":75254417,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1MjU0NDE3","user":{"login":"uce","id":1756620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTY2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1756620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce","html_url":"https://github.com/uce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-20T15:19:10Z","updated_at":"2015-02-20T15:19:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tillrohrmann and @StephanEwen worked on some other reliablity issues.

everybody for the positive feedback!\n\n> What does the OS load mean? It would be really awesome to show the CPU load, too. I think this is a helpful indicator.\n\nOn the OS load: http://blog.scoutapp.com/articles/2009/07/31/understanding-load-averages\n\nI totally agree that the OS load is not a very good metric for our purposes. \nThe reason why I didn't try to get better metrics for this is that I didn't want to play \"ugly tricks\" to get them.\nMy code is getting the metrics only via the management beans. The `OperatingSystemMXBean` is only exposing the load and the number of processor cores:\nhttp://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/management/OperatingSystemMXBean.html#getSystemLoadAverage()\nThere is another implementation of the `OperatingSystemMXBean` (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/jre/api/management/extension/com/sun/management/OperatingSystemMXBean.html) which is also exposing stuff like `getProcessCpuLoad()`.\nBut the availability of this management bean depends on the used JVM version etc.\n\nAnother way to get the CPU load of the process would be parsing the output of `ps` or `top`. But that also falls into the category of \"ugly tricks\".\nI think we should aim for getting those metrics into the system as well. Adding them is a matter of registering another Gauge in the TaskManager's metrics registry and visualizing the JSON output.\nI hope that these kinds of refinements are done by external contributors.\nOnce this PR has been merged, I'll file a JIRA to improve the CPU monitoring.\n\n> What are the current options for showing the detailed metrics? I see a \"show 3 TMs\" and \"show all TMs\" button in the screenshot? Can you select which three to show?\n\nNo, you cannot choose which three TMs. \nI added these buttons because starting a large Flink cluster (50+ nodes) will cause quite some load on the browser updating all the charts. Usually its sufficient to see monitor the load of a few TMs only, because they are doing mostly the same (ideally).\nBut I agree that there is room for improvement.\n\n> How about we open a document and sketch the design of the monitoring and create smaller PRs to get there step-by-step.\n\nI totally agree that we should do small incremental improvements. \nAs I said in the PR description, the primary purpose of this PR is to get the basic monitoring infrastructure in place, how we present the stuff in the end is subject to further PRs.\n\nI have started working on the \"per-job\" monitoring and found that I have to change some details of this PR as well.\nDepending on my progress on the \"per-job\" monitoring I might contribute the changes here together with the \"per-job\" metrics. If I don't have enough time this week to open a PR for the per job metrics this week, I'll merge this change to master.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/75545711/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/75545980","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/413#issuecomment-75545980","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/413","id":75545980,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1NTQ1OTgw","user":{"login":"rmetzger","id":89049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger","html_url":"https://github.com/rmetzger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-23T14:07:53Z","updated_at":"2015-02-23T14:07:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Exactly, the change is only for 0.8.\nFor 0.9 its already merged to master using the ExecutionConfig.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/75545980/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/75546102","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/408#issuecomment-75546102","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/408","id":75546102,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1NTQ2MTAy","user":{"login":"balidani","id":1805302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDUzMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1805302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/balidani","html_url":"https://github.com/balidani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balidani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balidani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balidani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balidani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balidani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balidani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balidani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balidani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balidani/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-23T14:08:34Z","updated_at":"2015-02-23T14:08:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @vasia!\n\nThanks for the review!

We just need a few more changes: \n- you can add the `Triplet` type inside the gsa package. This should just be a simple wrapper around `Tuple3<VV, EV, VV>`. (I think we don't even need the Vertex IDs here, just the values).\n- I see you have exposed the vertex keys in the UDFs. These should be hidden from the user-facing methods, e.g. in the SSSP example `gather()` should return `Double`, not `Tuple2<Long, Double>`, `sum()` should get two Doubles and return a Double (the minimum) and `apply()` should get a Double (the current value) and an M (the accumulator result) and return a Double.\n  More specifically, the UDFs should be defined like this:\n- `gather: Triplet -> M`\n- `sum: <M, M> -> M`\n- `apply: <VV, M> -> VV`\n\nOf course the wrappers inside `GatherSumApplyIteration` (`GatherUDF`, SumUDF`,`ApplyUDF`) will have to maintain the keys. The point is to hide them from the user :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/75770438/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/75775383","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/430#issuecomment-75775383","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/430","id":75775383,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1Nzc1Mzgz","user":{"login":"ktzoumas","id":1925554,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjU1NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1925554?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktzoumas","html_url":"https://github.com/ktzoumas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktzoumas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktzoumas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktzoumas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktzoumas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktzoumas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktzoumas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktzoumas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktzoumas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktzoumas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-24T15:18:54Z","updated_at":"2015-02-24T15:18:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Reads very very well.
