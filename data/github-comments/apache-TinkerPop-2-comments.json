I don't want our core APIs to be dumping grounds for method permutations (even with `default`) as I would prefer these APIs stay clean and minimalistic (and ultimately, simple for the provider to implement). However, if this is _required_ by Scala, then we can add it. If its just a _nicety_ for Scala we shouldn't (I leave it up to @mhfrantz to decide). As there will always be a \"pretty please\" down the line from some other language... We shouldn't cater if the language has a workaround (e.g. how did Gremlin-Scala work prior to this

Then in the tests we have a whole class of tests that run with that setting turned on so that if we happen to be on linux we get coverage there.\n\nDo you have any thoughts on this?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/148749579/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/148755126","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/110#issuecomment-148755126","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/110","id":148755126,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0ODc1NTEyNg==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-16T16:01:10Z","updated_at":"2015-10-16T16:01:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"VOTE: +1\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/148755126/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/148773801","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/109#issuecomment-148773801","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/109","id":148773801,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0ODc3MzgwMQ==","user":{"login":"anagav","id":2091845,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTE4NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2091845?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anagav","html_url":"https://github.com/anagav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anagav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anagav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anagav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anagav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anagav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anagav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anagav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anagav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anagav/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-16T17:04:44Z","updated_at":"2015-10-16T17:04:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@spmallette  I have successfully run the integration test after some fixes :). \n\nIt makes sense to to have separate tests for linux and non-linux env to get coverage of using epoll event loops.

Do you have any suggestions?\n\nI think we should add a configuration to manage epoll or not epoll somehow.  Maybe you add something to `Settings` called `useEpollIfPossible` that is `true` or `false` (default as `false`).  Then in your code, you use that setting on startup to use epoll if on linux (otherwise just use java nio) or if directly set to `false` just use java nio regardless of OS.  \n\nNow for tests, we could add an environment variable, like `GREMLIN_SERVER_EPOLL` which is `true` or `false`.  in `AbstractGremlinServerIntegration` test you check for that variable (defaulted to `false`) in the `overrideSettings` method.  If `true` then flip the `Setting` to `true` and return it.  That will make all the tests work against Gremlin Server configured in \"epoll mode\".\n\nLastly, we add a new maven profile to the gremlin-server `pom.xml` that adds your `GREMLIN_SERVER_EPOLL` environment variable to the failsafe plugin config so that the integration tests will get that.  In this way we can optionally run those tests as needed.  I think it is sufficient to not constantly run those tests, but if we decide that is so, we could move it out of a profile and into a second failsafe execution.\n\nThis change would also entail an update to the documentation to describe the `epollIfPossible` setting.\n\nWhat do you think?  Still interested in working on it? Sad that you got sucked into this? :wink: \n\n> I just subscribed to the mailing list.\n\ncool - welcome.  feel free to start up a thread on the CI issue.  @mhfrantz and i can will join in from there.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/148808152/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/148815587","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/109#issuecomment-148815587","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/109","id":148815587,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0ODgxNTU4Nw==","user":{"login":"anagav","id":2091845,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTE4NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2091845?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anagav","html_url":"https://github.com/anagav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anagav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anagav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anagav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anagav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anagav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anagav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anagav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anagav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anagav/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-16T19:37:58Z","updated_at":"2015-10-16T19:38:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@spmallette I have already added (first commit :) )  a variable in Settings class which can be overwritten from the config file. \n\nThe setting looks like: \n-  public boolean useEpollEventLoop = false;\n\nSo the decision to use epollevent loop would be `epollSettingEnabled && IS_OS_LINUX` .\n\nAdding a profile based test sounds good to me.

Something about modeling conservative processes, etc.  I feel like I'm this close [holds finger close to thumb] to understanding how this changes everything.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/149403480/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/149407781","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/112#issuecomment-149407781","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/112","id":149407781,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0OTQwNzc4MQ==","user":{"login":"okram","id":148925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODkyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/148925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram","html_url":"https://github.com/okram","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-20T02:29:39Z","updated_at":"2015-10-20T02:29:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Bulk and sack do not play well together when you are dealing with \"energy flows.\" Please see the existing 3.0.1-SNAPSHOT docs for a simple example:\n\n```\ngremlin> g.withSack(1.0f,sum).V(1).local(outE('knows').barrier(normSack).inV()).in('knows').barrier().sack() //(5)\n==>1.0\n==>1.0\ngremlin> g.withSack(1.0f,sum).V(1).local(outE('knows').barrier(normSack).inV()).in('knows').barrier().sideEffect{it.setBulk(1)}.sack() //(6)\n==>1.0\n```\n\n```\n5.

for making those changes - getting into nuts and bolts now.  I'm testing your changes locally.  In doing so, I think you can back out your change to the gremlin-driver pom.xml that adds:\n\n``` xml\n<dependency>\n  <groupId>io.netty</groupId>\n  <artifactId>netty-transport-native-epoll</artifactId>\n  <version>${netty.version}</version>\n</dependency>\n```\n\nepoll seems to come with `netty-all` which is already present.  Tests seem to work for me when I remove that extra dependency, but I thought I'd check with you first to make sure I'm not missing anything.  \n\nPlease validate that everything works on your end without that change and if so, amend your PR.  At that point, I will ask other committers to review and we can work toward

Here's a summary for those who haven't been following along:\n- The PR adds a configuration to Gremlin Server to use a linux-only netty feature that has shown to improve performance.\n- @anagav was good enough to work tests such that we can run Gremlin Server integration tests with and without this feature by way of a secondary maven profile.  In this way we can run tests on any platform.\n\nFrom my testing perspective, I successfully did:\n\n``` text\nmvn clean install\ncd gremlin-server\nmvn verify -DskipIntegrationTests=false\nmvn verify -DskipIntegrationTests=false -Plinux\n```\n\nEven if you're not testing on linux it would be good to try the `-Plinux` option as it will validate the fallback to java NIO and still work.  \n\nI'll handle the merge of this PR (when the VOTE is complete) and update changelog in the process.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/149652503/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/149672326","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/109#issuecomment-149672326","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/109","id":149672326,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0OTY3MjMyNg==","user":{"login":"okram","id":148925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODkyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/148925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram","html_url":"https://github.com/okram","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-20T19:12:22Z","updated_at":"2015-10-20T19:12:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I reviewed the code and the code looks clean.

You should move the \"old\" `readWriteConsumer` and `closeConsumer` to `AbstractThreadedTransaction`.  To make those work with existing usage in `AbstractTransaction` you'll need abstract methods on `AbstractTransaction` like `doReadWrite(Transaction)` and `doClose(Transaction)`.  Then in the respective sub-classes you implement those and with your implementation specific member variables. Not a big change - just need to move some stuff around - Does that make sense?\n\nAs for testing, your integration test covers this change from the top down (plus you obviously have your driver tests) but I think it would be good to include an explicit test in `TransactionTest`:\n\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-tinkerpop/blob/master/gremlin-test/src/main/java/org/apache/tinkerpop/gremlin/structure/TransactionTest.java\n\nThis way we enforce behavior on all Graph System providers that support transactions.  There is a chance that they will not extend `AbstractTransaction` and use their own, so we'd want to ensure that this functionality behaves no matter what they are trying to do or else folks will try to use their `Graph` implementations in Gremlin Server and they could fail.  \n\nYou would run tests against neo4j obviously...if you didn't know you need to explicitly do:\n\n``` text\nmvn clean install -DincludeNeo4j\n```\n\nsee the CONTRIBUTING doc for info on how to just run the `TransactionTest`.  I think you would minimally want a test or two that has two threads going where they each have their own independent settings for `readWriteConsumer` and `closeConsumer`.  Then you would want one where that ensured it was the same setting across threads - make sure that one has this annotation:\n\n``` java\n@FeatureRequirement(featureClass = Graph.Features.GraphFeatures.class, feature = Graph.Features.GraphFeatures.FEATURE_THREADED_TRANSACTIONS)\n```\n\nPlease yell if you need help sorting out what I wrote here.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/149887110/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/149890177","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/113#issuecomment-149890177","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/113","id":149890177,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0OTg5MDE3Nw==","user":{"login":"dmill-bz","id":1415875,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTU4NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1415875?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmill-bz","html_url":"https://github.com/dmill-bz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmill-bz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmill-bz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmill-bz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmill-bz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmill-bz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmill-bz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmill-bz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmill-bz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmill-bz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-21T13:14:28Z","updated_at":"2015-10-21T13:14:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ok that all makes perfect sense (I should have picked up on the AbstractThreadLocalTransaction), I'll go ahead with those changes.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/149890177/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/149948427","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/114#issuecomment-149948427","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/114","id":149948427,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0OTk0ODQyNw==","user":{"login":"pluradj","id":4974160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NzQxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4974160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj","html_url":"https://github.com/pluradj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-21T16:12:47Z","updated_at":"2015-10-21T16:12:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Built successfully with `mvn clean install -DcleanGrapes`.\nManually ran a couple subgraph() tests with Gremlin Server and Gremlin Console (remote).\nConcur with the comments on the wildcard imports.
