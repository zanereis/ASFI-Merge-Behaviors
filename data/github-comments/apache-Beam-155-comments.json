having both setters (serializer and coder) makes sense. For convenience, it would be nice if the user didn't have to specify the coder in simple cases. I think you can try doing that by inferring the coder, if it's not specified explicitly, from the type of the serializer. Here are the steps for that:\r\n\r\n* If a serializer is specified but coder is not, you can inspect the serializer's type using reflection and extract the type parameter of its base class.\r\n* When applying the Read.from() transform to an input, you can use input.getPipeline().getCoderRegistry() to try inferring a coder for that type. Then you'll need to pass that coder into the Source object so you can return it from getDefaultOutputCoder() (by the way, I think that method should be nullable but currently isn't - I've filed
