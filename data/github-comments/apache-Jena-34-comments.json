For example, the aforementioned counting of triples no longer returned results.\r\n\r\nIt's a certainly an ugly tradeoff  - but between \"strictly standard conforming result set but unbearably slow\" and \"usually same result set (unless there are duplicates in the union'd graphs) in a reasonable amount of time\" the latter is the practically relevant one our partners want to see. Especially, we know that our graphs are disjoint.\r\n\r\n### Upcoming Use Case: Graph Groups\r\n\r\nFurthermore, a general requirement we now have in one of our projects is to allow queries need to be able to refer to\r\n\"virtual\" graph names in the FROM clause which can be transparently remapped to the physical ones.\r\nThis is essentially Virtuoso's graph groups where FROM (NAMED) clauses can\r\nbe \"macro expanded\"; e.g. `FROM <x>` is conceptually turned into `FROM <a> FROM <b> ...`.\r\n\r\nIt is very easy to implement these kind features on ARQ level. All that would be needed is a way to pass the original dataset graph and dataset descriptions from Fuseki down to ARQ.\r\n\r\nOf course things would have to wired up in more sophisticated ways with Fuseki if one wanted to add user-sensitive rules. E.g. when authenticated as user X then graph G maps to (A, B) and as user Y graph G maps to C. But that's not (yet) what we need.\r\n\r\n> DynamicDataset work looks reversible.\r\n\r\nThe wrapped original dataset is not accessible (the \"projected\" attribute) :( (unless using brittle reflection).\r\nI would also be fine if unwrapping the orginal Dataset and DatasetDescription via DynamicDatasetGraph was possible.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic static class DynamicDatasetGraph extends DatasetGraphReadOnly implements DatasetGraphWrapperView {\r\n    private final DatasetGraph projected;\r\n\r\n    public DynamicDatasetGraph(DatasetGraph viewDSG, DatasetGraph baseDSG) {\r\n        super(viewDSG, baseDSG.getContext().copy());\r\n        this.projected = baseDSG;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1260883788/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1260982784","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/issues/1557#issuecomment-1260982784","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/1557","id":1260982784,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec5LKRIA","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-28T14:16:09Z","updated_at":"2022-09-28T14:16:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> The wrapped original dataset is not accessible\r\n\r\nThat would be a small change if it does not break `AccessCtl_SPARQL_QueryDataset` and around that area.\r\nVia a context setting so it can be undone maybe.

Add a custom operation implementation and handle the incoming request.\r\n\r\nThat's technical dept on our side:\r\n- It's not a good solution because the rewriting is only an ARQ-level operation which shouldn't escalate to/depend on the server. Checking for whether a Dataset is dynamic is also independent from Fuseki because fortunately DynamicDataset is in ARQ.\r\nConversely, an ARQ plugin doen't need to check for whether a Dataset originates specifically from Fuseki.\r\n-  With the way ACL is implemented in Fuseki, our rewriting based on DynamicDataset would (coincidentally) still work. Conversely, we don't want the prospect of potentially having to subclass every possible servlet when the task at hand is unrelated to them.\r\n- Right now, we have an ARQ plugin bundle which we just copy into the Fuseki extra folder. If we touched the servlets we'd need a Fuseki-plugin bundle (or would we even have to maintain our own Fuseki fork?).\r\n\r\n> Virtuoso [...]\r\n\r\nLet's leave it out because it adds nothing to the discussion.\r\n\r\n> Where is it coming from?\r\n\r\nApparently I am biased, but among my peers it's a common design pattern to have some form of query (template) catalogs that reference the target graph with FROM (typically a single one). \r\nFor example, there is a process where initially a query uses `FROM <latestEvents>` which gets then transformed into `FROM <events2022-09-30>`.\r\nFurthermore, multiple version of the same query (FROM vs GRAPH) is not acceptable because it becomes unmanageable quickly so there must be automatic transformations whenever possible! Within the processing pipelines the FROM clause can then be easily remapped to the final locations - much easier than GRAPH (in the worst case this could even be a regex hack).\r\n\r\nAnd this leads to the issue of slower requests in Fuseki+TDB2 due to DynamicDataset wrapping.\r\n\r\n- One solution for that is to (hard) code a specific rule that prevents the DynamicDataset wrapping when there is a query with just one FROM clause against TDB (considering all possible corner cases). If you want to add specific code for that case then that would help us too:\r\n\r\nIf I am not mistaken, then under certain conditions FROM and GRAPH are equivalent (w.r.t. to a given context; active graph and such), such as this:\r\n```sparql\r\nSELECT (COUNT(*) AS ?c) FROM <x> { ?s ?p ?o }\r\nSELECT (COUNT(*) AS ?c) { GRAPH <x> { ?s ?p ?o }\r\n```\r\n\r\n- The other solution - the one that I favor - is to have a general way to rewrite queries with FROMs that originate from Fuseki with ARQ plugins *without having to touch Fuseki*. This way I can experiment with FROM-to-GRAPH rewriting *independently and without stating that I will look into improving the counting issue* but still have the opportunity to provide a solution as an ARQ plugin bundle that works with vanilla Fuseki in a more future-proof way. If it turns out to be of general community interest then we can still have a discussion integrating the rewriting at a later stage (or maybe by then you already solved it). Yes, it would also allow one to experiment with FROM expansions but this is not a relevant discussion now.\r\n\r\nAs it stands, it seems to me that making the projected dataset in DynamicDataset accessible would be the best solution.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1263317360/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1263757790","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/issues/1559#issuecomment-1263757790","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/1559","id":1263757790,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec5LU2ne","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-30T16:06:48Z","updated_at":"2022-09-30T16:06:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The other two provide begin-commit/abort.

No application should be depending on implementation classes.\r\n\r\nHi @afs, \r\nI'm sorry that my prediction to finish the work on this PR by the end of August was wrong.\r\nThis PR still refers to a branch with a graph that I would only use for very specific use cases and that is not a replacement for GraphMem.\r\n\r\nI still plan to move two candidates (currently called GraphMem2 and GraphMem2Fast) from https://github.com/arne-bdt/jena/tree/GraphExperiments to this PR that would make a good replacement for GraphMem. \r\nMy code needs more testing, documentation, renaming, and cleanup to end up with a maintainable solution.\r\n\r\nCould you perhaps help me with the following questions?\r\n1. where should I add JHM benchmarks? \r\n     To get reliable benchmarks, I needed to introduce JMH. I could easily integrate them into the tests of [jena-arq](https://github.com/arne-bdt/jena/tree/GraphExperiments/jena-arq/src/test/java/org/apache/jena/mem/jmh). \r\n     Would it be appropriate to add a new project called \"jena-benchmarks-jmh\" and move the benchmarks there?\r\n2. where can I get more graphs?\r\n    In the jena repository I could only find \"cheeses-0.1.ttl\" and \"pizza.owl.rdf\" as small sample graphs. \r\n    The graphs I use at work are strictly confidential. There are some comparable graphs provided by ENTSO-E in their conformity assessment, which I can only refer to but not include in the repository.\r\n    I have created additional graphs using [datagenerator] (http://wbsg.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/bizer/berlinsparqlbenchmark/spec/BenchmarkRules/index.html#datagenerator), but the files are quite large and I am not sure whether to include them in the repository.\r\n   The benchmarks behave differently for each type of graph. Sometimes due to hash collisions or different distributions of subjects, predicates and objects. The current results look good to me, but it should be easy for any user to validate their graphs against different graph implementations.\r\n   I think it would be nice to have a public repository with example graphs and even large graphs to have a common base for benchmarks. --> Maybe \"jena-benchmarks-jmh\" should be a separate repository that could contain large graphs?\r\n3. how to deal with typed literals in example graphs?\r\n   Most example graphs seem to be serialized without type information. The benchmarks behave differently if all objects are treated as strings. For our rdf graphs, I implemented a [TypedTripleReader](https://github.com/arne-bdt/jena/blob/GraphExperiments/jena-arq/src/test/java/org/apache/jena/mem/TypedTripleReader.java) that uses the rdf schema files defined by CIM/CGMES. But the implementation felt strange, as this should be a general task.   \r\n  Is there a simpler, more general way to read graphs with typed literals?\r\n\r\nGreetings\r\nArne\r\n\r\n       \r\n     \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1264429044/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1264595049","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/issues/1557#issuecomment-1264595049","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/1557","id":1264595049,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec5LYDBp","user":{"login":"Aklakan","id":839608,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzOTYwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/839608?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan","html_url":"https://github.com/Aklakan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-02T09:30:25Z","updated_at":"2022-10-03T11:02:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"* Yes, the data is in TDB\r\n* As you said, if there are 2+ FROM clauses a general distinct is made loading everything into in memory.

I don't think this has to be TDB specific (e.g. a servlet specifically for TDB).\r\n\r\nWith the current interfaces, the options for doing so seem to be reasonably limited to dataset, query or context. And I agree with your argument that components beneath Fuseki should receive a dataset that per-se only exposes the right amount quads w.r.t. to the protocol and security, as this makes it harder for other components/plugins to accidentally leak information.\r\n\r\nThe final option I see here is having a flag in the dataset context that gets picked up by Fuseki and disables its dynamic dataset wrapping - thus passing the dataset and query on as-is. But this might again leak data when additional wrappers are involved which unintentionally incorrectly pass on that context attribute.\r\n\r\nThe remaining option is to also put the projected dataset into the context just like the named graph and default graphs.

so.\r\n\r\nI did some additional work and it looked like the `ja:schema` may have been partially suspect.  I went back to 4.6.1 and adjusted the config to remove the `ja:UnionModel` and used a `tdb2:unionDefaultGraph` instead like so:\r\n```\r\n...\r\n    fuseki:endpoint [ fuseki:name \"sparql\" ; fuseki:operation fuseki:query ;\r\n        ## Set default-union-graph for this endpoint.\r\n        ja:context [ ja:cxtName \"tdb2:unionDefaultGraph\" ; ja:cxtValue true ] ; ] ;\r\n...\r\n:graphInfMyData ja:InfModel ;\r\n    rdfs:label \"MyData Inference Model\" ;\r\n    ja:baseModel :graphDefault ;\r\n    ja:reasoner :reasonerMyData ;\r\n    .\r\n...\r\n<<< Remove :modelUnionMyData <<<\r\n...\r\n:graphDefault a tdb2:GraphTDB2 ;\r\n    rdfs:label \"Default Graph\" ;\r\n    tdb2:graphName \"urn:x-arq:UnionGraph\" ;\r\n    tdb2:dataset :ds_tdb2_MyData;\r\n    .\r\n```\r\nThis left the Reasoner intact:\r\n```\r\n:reasonerMyData a ja:Reasoner ;\r\n    ja:reasonerURL res:OWLMicroFBRuleReasoner ;\r\n    ja:schema :graphGNR_Ont ;\r\n    ja:schema :graphGNR_VCard ;\r\n    .\r\n```\r\nOn startup, I got an error immediately after the Shiro load:\r\n```\r\n[2022-10-24 14:33:19.738] ERROR [main] [org.apache.jena.fuseki.webapp.FusekiServerListener.serverInitialization(FusekiServerListener.java:106)] - Exception in initialization: caught: Not in a transaction\r\n[2022-10-24 14:33:19.738] WARN [main] [org.eclipse.jetty.webapp.WebAppContext.doStart(WebAppContext.java:541)] - Failed startup of context...\r\n```\r\nWhen I removed the `ja:schema` statements, it all worked well for 4.6.1:\r\n```\r\n...\r\n:reasonerCOLT a ja:Reasoner ;\r\n    ja:reasonerURL res:OWLMicroFBRuleReasoner ;\r\n#    ja:schema :graphGNR_Ont ;\r\n#    ja:schema :graphGNR_VCard ;\r\n    .\r\n...\r\n```\r\nAs I was writing this up, I decided to test 4.7.0-SNAPSHOT as well.\r\n1. Using 4.7.0-SNAPSHOT with the previous config and only moving the  `ja:schema` statements to `ja:subModel` statements in the `ja:UnionModel` didn't help as much as I thought it might--I still got 500 errors after using the UI Edit to view a few graphs.\r\n2. Using 4.7.0-SNAPSHOT with the updated config (above) seems to work well. I couldn't break it with my limited testing.\r\n\r\nAlso, I've tested this issue on multiple machines with different environments, so it's not just due to one machine's peculiar settings.\r\n\r\n**It seems a `ja:UnionModel` is the ultimate culprit.**\r\n\r\nBy using the config with the changes above, the resulting inference on the union default graph adds more graphs than I want. I can live with it for now.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1289483003/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1291188129","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/issues/1588#issuecomment-1291188129","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/1588","id":1291188129,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec5M9feh","user":{"login":"OyvindLGjesdal","id":5328572,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjg1NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5328572?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OyvindLGjesdal","html_url":"https://github.com/OyvindLGjesdal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OyvindLGjesdal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OyvindLGjesdal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OyvindLGjesdal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OyvindLGjesdal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OyvindLGjesdal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OyvindLGjesdal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OyvindLGjesdal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OyvindLGjesdal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OyvindLGjesdal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-25T21:59:36Z","updated_at":"2022-10-25T21:59:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"doh, I downloaded the wrong jar, the correct one should be https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/jena/jena-fuseki-geosparql/4.6.1/jena-fuseki-geosparql-4.6.1.jar and not jena-geosparql-4.6.1.jar.

Too many things ...\r\n\r\n_JMH Benchmarks_\r\n\r\nJMH benchmarks: Jena doesn't have any so we're looking to learn.\r\n\r\nIf `jena-benchmarks-jmh` is good practice, then \"yes\".\r\n\r\nOne word of warning - our CI environments (Apache run Jenkins, and GitHuib actions) - seem positively troublesome towards our timeout tests. This is because they are heavily loaded virtual machines. Sometimes, they pause for significant periods of time - 30 seconds or more. I think, can't prove, this is mostly likely when they do some external operations such as disk I/O.\r\n\r\nBut even if they are troublesome, the JMH benchmarks are good to have to be run on less hostile environments.\r\n\r\n_\"where can I get more graphs?\"_\r\n\r\nI've got BSBM in various sizes - for parse speed tests I use 25million - it's large enough for the parser to settle down so that 25m and 50m give the same speed. \r\n\r\n25e6, 50e6 and 100e6 from the list below\r\n\r\nTemporary:\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ev2CCKB0MBqNXhZdsbOIRxQVBH4mJ0tF\r\n\r\n```\r\nbsbm-50k.nt.gz -- File size: 1.4M  bytes\r\nbsbm-250k.nt.gz -- 6.7M\r\n\r\nbsbm-1m.nt.gz -- 27M\r\nbsbm-5m.nt.gz -- 137M\r\nbsbm-25m.nt.gz -- 660M\r\nbsbm-50m.nt.gz -- 1.3G\r\n\r\nbsbm-100m.nt.gz -- 2.6G\r\nbsbm-200m.nt.gz -- 5.2G\r\nbsbm-300m.nt.gz -- 7.8G \r\nbsbm-400m.nt.gz -- 11G\r\nbsbm-500m.nt.gz -- 13G\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow we deal with data for JMH at scale is very unclear so for now I suggest easy steps - incorporate the tests, external files,  don't run them in the main build yet.\r\n\r\n_how to deal with typed literals in example graphs_ \r\n\r\nBSBM has xsd:date, xsd:dateTime and xsd:integer in the data.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying it has to be BSBM. I use it for parser and loader tests where the characteristic of BSBM that it contains a significant proportion of large literals (100, sometimes 1000's of chars long) is useful so I happen to have it lying around and can generate sets of any size. And having used them over time, I have old figures lying around (a track of the history of hardware!).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1304895584/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1306032695","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/issues/1581#issuecomment-1306032695","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/1581","id":1306032695,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec5N2Ho3","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-07T18:41:35Z","updated_at":"2022-11-07T18:41:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks!

Whereas here we know that the range in the dependency version, if used on a fresh install, would pick the correct and secure version. So dependabot just updates the lock file. But either way should be fine, we can get rid of the specific versions later.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1309132108/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1309166063","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/1609#issuecomment-1309166063","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/1609","id":1309166063,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec5OCEnv","user":{"login":"dependabot[bot]","id":49699333,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDk2OTkzMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/29110?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/dependabot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-09T18:09:14Z","updated_at":"2022-11-09T18:09:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks like loader-utils is up-to-date now, so this is no longer needed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1309166063/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1309168961","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/issues/1583#issuecomment-1309168961","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/1583","id":1309168961,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec5OCFVB","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-09T18:10:23Z","updated_at":"2022-11-09T18:10:23Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Ping. \r\n\r\nWe'll assume that everything mentioned works using the development codebase for the next release -
