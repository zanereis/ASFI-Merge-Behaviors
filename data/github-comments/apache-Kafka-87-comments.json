It seems appealing to deprecate both at the same time and the old consumer won't be deprecated until after 0.10.1.0. I don't feel strongly either way though.\n\nWe had a recent discussion in the mailing list about removing the beta label from the new consumer and people were in favour. As such, it would be great to include this PR in the next release. The minimum set of changes IMO are:\n1. Make the new consumer the default as long as `--zookeeper` is not specified\n2. Fail with an error if `--zookeeper` and `--new-consumer` are specified at the same time\n3. Support the `--new-consumer` option for compatibility\n4. Update usages of the tools in the docs to use the new consumer\n5. Add a note in upgrade.html\n\nI am not sure if we should support `--old-consumer`. The main reason would be to be consistent with the console producer, but probably not worth it.\n\n@arunmahadevan, can you please rebase the PR?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/243416294/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/243442173","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1683#issuecomment-243442173","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1683","id":243442173,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MzQ0MjE3Mw==","user":{"login":"nepal","id":791273,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MTI3Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/791273?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nepal","html_url":"https://github.com/nepal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nepal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nepal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nepal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nepal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nepal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nepal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nepal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nepal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nepal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-30T13:41:56Z","updated_at":"2016-08-30T13:41:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Obsolete.
