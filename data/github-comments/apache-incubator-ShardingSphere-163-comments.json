Thank you very much for the detailed information, and according to the test case you provided, I investigated the cause of the error, and the results are as follows:\r\n\r\n## DDL Statements\r\n\r\nThe exception in the execution of the DDL statement is a bug in the 5.X version. This [PR](https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/pull/7949) will fix this problem.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\n-- @title:truncate,hasShardingKey:none\r\n-- DDL\r\nTRUNCATE customer;\r\n\r\n-- @title:truncateTable,hasShardingKey:none\r\n-- DDL\r\nTRUNCATE TABLE customer;\r\n\r\n-- @title:createIndex,hasShardingKey:none\r\n-- DDL\r\nCREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_customer_email using btree on customer_email  (email(10)) comment 'index for email';\r\n\r\n-- @title:dropIndex,hasShardingKey:none\r\n-- DDL\r\n-- DROP INDEX idx_customer_email;\r\nDROP INDEX idx_customer_email on customer_email;\r\n\r\n-- @title:dropIndexWithAlgorithm,hasShardingKey:none\r\n-- DDL\r\nDROP INDEX idx_customer_email on customer_email algorithm = default;\r\n\r\n-- @title:dropIndexPrimary,hasShardingKey:none\r\n-- DDL\r\nDROP INDEX `PRIMARY` ON customer_email;\r\n```\r\n\r\n## DCL Statements\r\n\r\nThe `GRANT Statement` is executed abnormally, which is also caused by a BUG, and this [PR](https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/pull/7949) will fix it.\r\nI refer to the official [MySQL documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/set-password.html), the `SET PASSWORD` statement should not support `= PASSWORD('auth_string')`.\r\n\r\n\r\n```sql\r\n-- @title:grant,hasShardingKey:none\r\n-- DCL\r\nGRANT SELECT ON db2.invoice TO 'jeffrey'@'localhost';\r\n\r\n-- @title:setPassword,hasShardingKey:none\r\n-- DCL\r\nSET PASSWORD FOR 'bob'@'%.example.org' = PASSWORD('auth_string');\r\n```\r\n\r\n## DAL Statements\r\n\r\nThe `SET Character Statement` occur exception is caused by SQL parse error and it will be fixed together.\r\nThe `SHOW CREATE EVENT`, `SHOW CREATE USER` and `SHOW CREATE VIEW` statements are not supported in 4.X and 5.X versions.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\n-- @title:setCharacterSet,hasShardingKey:none\r\n-- DAL\r\nSET Character Set 'utf8';\r\n\r\n-- @title:showCreateEvent,hasShardingKey:none\r\n-- DAL\r\nSHOW CREATE EVENT event_name;\r\n\r\n-- @title:showCreateUser,hasShardingKey:none\r\n-- DAL\r\nSHOW CREATE USER `user`;\r\n\r\n-- @title:showCreateView,hasShardingKey:none\r\n-- DAL\r\nSHOW CREATE VIEW view_name;\r\n\r\n-- @title:showIndexes,hasShardingKey:none\r\n-- DAL\r\nSHOW INDEXES from ai in customer;\r\n\r\n-- @title:showKeys,hasShardingKey:none\r\n-- DAL\r\nSHOW KEYS from customer;\r\n\r\n-- @title:showKeys,hasShardingKey:none\r\n-- DAL\r\nSHOW KEYS in ai in customer where column_name like '%id%';\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe syntax of the `SHOW INDEXES` and `SHOW KEYS` statements are as follows, the first parameter of the \"from in\" clause is \"tbl_name\", which is the `ai` table in the case​​. If this table does not exist, a similar exception will occur——`[Can not route tables for `[ai]`, please make sure the tables are in same schema.]`:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSHOW [EXTENDED] {INDEX | INDEXES | KEYS}\r\n    {FROM | IN} tbl_name\r\n    [{FROM | IN} db_name]\r\n    [WHERE expr]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## RL Statements\r\n\r\nThe exception of `start slave sql_thread until MASTER_LOG_FILE = 'log_name', MASTER_LOG_POS = 4;` and `stop slave io_thread for channel 'channel1';` statements are caused by sql parse error, and it will be fixed soon.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\n-- @title:startSlaveSqlThread,hasShardingKey:none\r\n-- RL\r\nstart slave sql_thread until MASTER_LOG_FILE = 'log_name', MASTER_LOG_POS = 4;\r\n\r\n-- @title:startSlaveIoThread,hasShardingKey:none\r\n-- RL\r\nstart slave io_thread until RELAY_LOG_FILE  = 'log_name', MASTER_LOG_POS = 4;\r\n\r\n-- @title:stopSlave,hasShardingKey:none\r\n-- RL\r\nstop slave io_thread for channel 'channel1';\r\n\r\n-- @title:stopGroupReplication,hasShardingKey:none\r\n-- RL\r\nSTOP GROUP_REPLICATION;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAccording to the definition of MySQL documents, the `start slave io_thread until RELAY_LOG_FILE  = 'log_name', MASTER_LOG_POS = 4;` statement seems to be illegal.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSTART {SLAVE | REPLICA} [thread_types] [until_option] [connection_options] [channel_option]\r\n\r\nthread_types:\r\n    [thread_type [, thread_type] ... ]\r\n\r\nthread_type:\r\n    IO_THREAD | SQL_THREAD\r\n\r\nuntil_option:\r\n    UNTIL {   {SQL_BEFORE_GTIDS | SQL_AFTER_GTIDS} = gtid_set\r\n          |   MASTER_LOG_FILE = 'log_name', MASTER_LOG_POS = log_pos\r\n          |   RELAY_LOG_FILE = 'log_name', RELAY_LOG_POS = log_pos\r\n          |   SQL_AFTER_MTS_GAPS  }\r\n\r\nconnection_options:\r\n    [USER='user_name'] [PASSWORD='user_pass'] [DEFAULT_AUTH='plugin_name'] [PLUGIN_DIR='plugin_dir']\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `STOP GROUP_REPLICATION` statement is not currently supported.\r\n\r\n---------------\r\nThank you again for the detailed information, and welcome you to test again after the [PR](https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/pull/7949) is merged. 😉\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/718052604/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/718059498","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/7903#issuecomment-718059498","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/7903","id":718059498,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxODA1OTQ5OA==","user":{"login":"willzh55","id":38455226,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDU1MjI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38455226?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willzh55","html_url":"https://github.com/willzh55","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willzh55/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willzh55/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willzh55/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willzh55/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willzh55/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willzh55/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willzh55/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willzh55/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willzh55/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-28T16:40:04Z","updated_at":"2020-10-28T16:40:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\r\n**Similar problems**\r\n\r\n```log\r\n[INFO ] com.zaxxer.hikari.HikariDataSource.getConnection(HikariDataSource.java:110) - HikariPool-1 - Starting...\r\n [INFO ] com.zaxxer.hikari.pool.PoolBase.getAndSetNetworkTimeout(PoolBase.java:535) - HikariPool-1 - Driver does not support get/set network timeout for connections.
