discussion happened on this issue last week. I think what needs to be done to make log rotation work along with archiving is:\n- Modification of TaskLogPusher that allows pushing logs in chunks. This is technically an external interface, so we may have to consider whether it's likely that there are any implementations outside of druid-io.\n- Modification of ForkingTaskRunner to use that new stuff and actually push logs in chunks.\n- Some kind of TaskLogStreamer that can unify the log chunks and any fragment still present on the actual task runner.\n\nOr if we just want to throw away old logs, it's a little simpler:\n- Modification of ForkingTaskRunner to split logs into chunks and periodically delete old chunks. \n- When it's time to push logs (at the end of a task, if that ever happens) then merge & push whatever chunks haven't been deleted yet.\n\nI think it would be nice to do the first thing, since I am a pack rat when it comes to logs, but I'm also wondering how other people feel.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/121059721/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/121064669","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/1511#issuecomment-121064669","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1511","id":121064669,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyMTA2NDY2OQ==","user":{"login":"himanshug","id":246308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjMwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug","html_url":"https://github.com/himanshug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-13T21:27:18Z","updated_at":"2015-07-13T21:27:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"close/reopen

I'd be happy to squash if you guys want, I made a lot of commits just to make the changes easy to follow.\n\n@drcrallen as for your concern about rules, I really don't know how to approach this. It should be noted that this behaves similarly to the S3 firehose so whatever changes we make here we should probably make there for consistency. I don't see this firehose being applicable for realtime scenarios, only indexing service and correct me if I'm wrong, but it's my understanding that won't push segments until the task completes with a \"Success\" status. The firehose doesn't delete files either, so I believe the answer to your question is just \"Run the task
