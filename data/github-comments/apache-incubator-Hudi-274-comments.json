It should raise exception )\r\n\r\nI wasn't able to use 0.11.0 because it has a compatibility issue in AWS Glue. ( it was related to AWS Glue Catalog )\r\nI wasn't able to use 0.10.1 because it has a bug in ZookeeperLockProvider.\r\n\r\nI ended up using 0.10.1 + a patch that fixed the  ZookeeperLockProvider ( available on 0.11.1 )\r\nAnd, I added a logic that checks if the target partition exists ( cc @codope )\r\n\r\nI will test with 0.11.1 and reopen this ticket if I still notice the similar issue.\r\n\r\nThank you\r\nGatsby","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1240177021/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1240196482","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/6609#issuecomment-1240196482","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/6609","id":1240196482,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5J6-WC","user":{"login":"Gump518","id":71010711,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDEwNzEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71010711?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gump518","html_url":"https://github.com/Gump518","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gump518/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gump518/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gump518/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gump518/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gump518/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gump518/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gump518/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gump518/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gump518/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-08T04:16:10Z","updated_at":"2022-09-08T04:16:10Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"clustering causes data duplication or presto engine adapter issue","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1240196482/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1240213423","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/6623#issuecomment-1240213423","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/6623","id":1240213423,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5J7Cev","user":{"login":"praveenkmr","id":9969269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5NjkyNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9969269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/praveenkmr","html_url":"https://github.com/praveenkmr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praveenkmr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praveenkmr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praveenkmr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praveenkmr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praveenkmr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praveenkmr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praveenkmr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praveenkmr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praveenkmr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-08T04:44:59Z","updated_at":"2022-09-08T04:44:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@yihua  Thanks a lot, Ethan..

However, we should not be adding this whole end to end test in `TestCOWDataSource` and `TestMORDataSource`. These tests are there to test overall datasource related functionality, and should not really be used to test something so specific as DMS payload. There should be no need to run an entire end to end test to discover this issue.\r\n> \r\n> There is a `TestAWSDmsAvroPayload` class. We should understand why tests in that class did not catch the issue, and just modify them or add a new test as needed to be able to catch this issue.\r\n\r\nSounds good I agree that adding this unittest in this class might be unnecessary. As for modifying or adding a new test within `TestAWSDmsAvroPayload` this also might not be needed as the tests actually are referring to the correct api and do have coverage. For example in one of the unit tests of that class that handles delete case\r\n```\r\n  @Test\r\n  public void testDelete() {\r\n    Schema avroSchema = new Schema.Parser().parse(AVRO_SCHEMA_STRING);\r\n    GenericRecord deleteRecord = new GenericData.Record(avroSchema);\r\n    deleteRecord.put(\"field1\", 2);\r\n    deleteRecord.put(\"Op\", \"D\");\r\n\r\n    GenericRecord oldRecord = new GenericData.Record(avroSchema);\r\n    oldRecord.put(\"field1\", 2);\r\n    oldRecord.put(\"Op\", \"U\");\r\n\r\n    AWSDmsAvroPayload payload = new AWSDmsAvroPayload(Option.of(deleteRecord));\r\n\r\n    try {\r\n      Option<IndexedRecord> outputPayload = payload.combineAndGetUpdateValue(oldRecord, avroSchema);\r\n      // expect nothing to be committed to table\r\n      assertFalse(outputPayload.isPresent());\r\n    } catch (Exception e) {\r\n      fail(\"Unexpected exception\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nit uses the correct `combineAndGetUpdateValue(oldRecord, avroSchema);` method signature which is not requiring us to take in account the `properties` object. \r\n\r\nIf we want to reproduce the same exception as what was reported we can add the `properties` object to the call `  Option<IndexedRecord> outputPayload = payload.combineAndGetUpdateValue(oldRecord, avroSchema, properties);` and get the same exception \r\n```\r\nava.util.NoSuchElementException: No value present in Option\r\n\tat org.apache.hudi.common.util.Option.get(Option.java:89)\r\n\tat org.apache.hudi.common.model.AWSDmsAvroPayload.combineAndGetUpdateValue(AWSDmsAvroPayload.java:85)\r\n\tat org.apache.hudi.common.model.TestAWSDmsAvroPayload.testDeleteWithProperties(TestAWSDmsAvroPayload.java:123)\r\n\tat sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this however would not make sense as this code change is making sure to use the signature without the `properties` for both `return getInsertValue(schema)` and `\r\nreturn combineAndGetUpdateValue(currentValue, schema)` similar to what the tests have been doing for some time.
