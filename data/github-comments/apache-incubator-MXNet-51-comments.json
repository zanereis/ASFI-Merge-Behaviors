It seems to be a common problem. I have started working on it. Currently I have failed to reproduce the problem on the machine where I compiled the code. I will move to another machine and see if it is a configuration problem. Could you guys also help by trying the following?\n1. run \"where libmxnet.dll\" and see if you are using the right version of libmxnet.dll\n2. run matrixMulCuBLAS from nvidia CUDA samples and see if it works\n3. try building mxnet from source and do the test again\n\nSince it is the same problem with #1228. Let's all move to issue #1228 for this problem.

But to fine-tune it, I may need to change the upmost layer (softmax) to my desired loss function, and initialize fc1000 with random (not from pre-trained model because dimension doesn't match), also I may want to change the learning rate for the upmost layer for  a faster convergence. I looked at issue #1004 and you mentioned \"internal\" method can be used to extract internal parameters, however can we change it directly rather than build from scratch as the only thing we need to change is the top most layer? Or even if we have to build from scratch, do we have API to extract and iterate symbols from the original symbol to avoid do it by hand? Ultimately, can we have a tutorial/example for transfer learning from a pre-trained model as it is really a common use case?

piiswrong,thanks for your quick response.\ni built and installed the MXNet package According to the official website(http://mxnet.readthedocs.org/en/latest/build.html).\nAnd i mean to use Python API,my system is ubuntu 14.\nWhen i copied code from 'Code Examples' to my Pycharm ,i found that Pycharm cannot \nrecognize part of function such as 'mxnet.symbol.FullyConnected' and so on.\nBut it can recognize part of function such as 'mxnet.symbol.Variable' and so on.\nSo i checked up my ~/mxnet/python/mxnet/symbol.py ,i found that there is no function 'FullyConnected' indeed.\nPrompt message from Pycharm is 'cannot find reference 'FullyConnected' in 'symbol.py'.\nIs it possible that my Installation process was at fault ?\nIs there someone else encountered this problem(is likely to be my own problem)?\nAnd i really need your help.\nLooking forward to your

I installed the R package with option `--no-test-load` to check out where files are placed and what they look like.

I then made symbolic links such that both objects are found in both directories `~/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.2/mxnet/libs/` and `~/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.2/mxnet/libs/x86_64`.
