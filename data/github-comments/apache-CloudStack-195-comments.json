I think that we should pay attention if the change of user and caller will really do the job. So far I do not see how this PR changes the behavior.\r\n\r\nBasically this code changes two parameters in startVirtualRouter [_callerUser_ and _caller_ when calling startVirtualRouter(router, callerUser, caller, routerDeploymentDefinition.getParams())]. However, those parameters are only used inside startVirtualRouter when calling the method start(router, user, caller, params, null).\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (router.getRole() != Role.VIRTUAL_ROUTER || !router.getIsRedundantRouter()) {\r\n            return start(router, user, caller, params, null);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the method **start** does not use either the _user_ and the _caller_ parameters in the overridden implementation (the one that you are using).\r\n\r\n```\r\n    protected DomainRouterVO start(DomainRouterVO router, final User user, final Account caller, final Map<Param, Object> params, final DeploymentPlan planToDeploy)\r\n            throws StorageUnavailableException, InsufficientCapacityException, ConcurrentOperationException, ResourceUnavailableException {\r\n        s_logger.debug(\"Starting router \" + router);\r\n        try {\r\n            _itMgr.advanceStart(router.getUuid(), params, planToDeploy, null);\r\n        } catch (final OperationTimedoutException e) {\r\n            throw new ResourceUnavailableException(\"Starting router \" + router + \" failed! \" + e.toString(), DataCenter.class, router.getDataCenterId());\r\n        }\r\n        if (router.isStopPending()) {\r\n            s_logger.info(\"Clear the stop pending flag of router \" + router.getHostName() + \" after start router successfully!\");\r\n            router.setStopPending(false);\r\n            router = _routerDao.persist(router);\r\n        }\r\n        // We don't want the failure of VPN Connection affect the status of\r\n        // router, so we try to make connection\r\n        // only after router start successfully\r\n        final Long vpcId = router.getVpcId();\r\n        if (vpcId != null) {\r\n            _s2sVpnMgr.reconnectDisconnectedVpnByVpc(vpcId);\r\n        }\r\n        return _routerDao.findById(router.getId());\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSorry, but I can't see how your code alters the behavior as intended. Can you please show that by changing the parameters _user_ and _caller_ you are changing the behavior?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/284080525/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/284130539","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/892#issuecomment-284130539","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/892","id":284130539,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NDEzMDUzOQ==","user":{"login":"cloudmonger","id":22165217,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTY1MjE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22165217?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudmonger","html_url":"https://github.com/cloudmonger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudmonger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudmonger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudmonger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudmonger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudmonger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudmonger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudmonger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudmonger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudmonger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-04T05:57:25Z","updated_at":"2017-03-04T05:57:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"###

How about you temporary alter 'vmware.create.full.clone' to make it true for the PS pool used during the test and then revert it back to the original value.\r\nYou can use similar to below to alter flag just for the PS pool:\r\n       updateConfigurationCmd = updateConfiguration.updateConfigurationCmd()\r\n        updateConfigurationCmd.name = \"vmware.create.full.clone\"\r\n        updateConfigurationCmd.value = \"true\"\r\n        updateConfigurationCmd.storageid = pool.id\r\n        updateConfigurationResponse = self.apiClient.updateConfiguration(updateConfigurationCmd)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/284243594/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/284297687","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1278#issuecomment-284297687","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1278","id":284297687,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NDI5NzY4Nw==","user":{"login":"anshul1886","id":1712815,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MTI4MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1712815?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886","html_url":"https://github.com/anshul1886","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-06T04:01:41Z","updated_at":"2017-03-06T04:01:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@GabrielBrascher @rafaelweingartner, Please go through deployment planner code. Deployment planner decides the VM placement and virtual router also goes through that. Deployment planners uses allocators and planners. In those planners and allocators you will find the admin account related checks as pointed out in one of my previous comment. My intent to point out those old commits of Calling context introduction was that with that introduction there is calling context is passed around implicit. Here the code changes are making sure that context gets changed to proper user.\r\n\r\nHope this clears your

I also made a minor tweak to the UI to allow setting the root disk bus via the add template dialog in the UI:\r\n\r\n![template_screen1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1360240/23617917/4d49494a-0254-11e7-8bf1-9c33a68a407d.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n![template_screen](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1360240/23617743/b29b8dd6-0253-11e7-970b-6aafe314bd49.png)\r\n\r\nSo this way you can select virtio scsi by one of the following three ways:\r\n\r\n1) selecting os type as \"Other PV Virtio-SCSI (64 bit)\"\r\n2) uploading a template and specifying details[0].rootDiskController=scsi, either from the UI or the API, then creating a VM from this template\r\n3) deploying a VM and specifying details[0].rootDiskController=scsi , currently only available via the API\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/284440859/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/284442424","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1278#issuecomment-284442424","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1278","id":284442424,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NDQ0MjQyNA==","user":{"login":"rafaelweingartner","id":4129005,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjkwMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4129005?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelweingartner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-06T16:07:18Z","updated_at":"2017-03-06T16:07:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@anshul1886 sorry, but I still do not understand you.\r\n\r\nYour changes affect `NetworkHelperImpl.java` class. Do we agree on that?\r\n\r\nYou changed lines 334 and 512. You changed the call `startVirtualRouter`; this method is implemented in the same `NetworkHelperImpl.java` class. Before you change the call was `startVirtualRouter(router, _accountMgr.getSystemUser(), _accountMgr.getSystemAccount(), routerDeploymentDefinition.getParams())`; then, you altered the code to `startVirtualRouter(router, callerUser, caller, routerDeploymentDefinition.getParams())`. \r\n\r\nYou changed the way the code is retrieving objects “user” and “account”; before the user was retrieved as `_accountMgr.getSystemUser()`, now it is retrieved as `_accountMgr.getActiveUser(CallContext.current().getCallingUserId())`. The account was obtained as `_accountMgr.getSystemAccount()` and now it is obtained as `CallContext.current().getCallingAccount()`.\r\n\r\nCan we agree on this?\r\n\r\nYou are telling me to look at the Deployment planner. However, what I fail to understand is the following.\r\n\r\nLooking at lines 334 and 512, the `user` and `account` are passed as parameters to `com.cloud.network.router.NetworkHelperImpl.startVirtualRouter(DomainRouterVO, User, Account, Map<Param, Object>)`. This method is in the same ` NetworkHelperImpl` class. The only thing the ` startVirtualRouter` method does with the mentioned objects is to send them as parameters to ` com.cloud.network.router.NetworkHelperImpl.start(DomainRouterVO, User, Account, Map<Param, Object>, DeploymentPlan)` at lines 349, 387, or 412. Then, the method to ` com.cloud.network.router.NetworkHelperImpl.start(DomainRouterVO, User, Account, Map<Param, Object>, DeploymentPlan)` does not use the ` User` and `Account` objects.\r\n\r\nCan we agree on that?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/284442424/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/284450044","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1961#issuecomment-284450044","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1961","id":284450044,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NDQ1MDA0NA==","user":{"login":"serg38","id":16176702,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTc2NzAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16176702?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38","html_url":"https://github.com/serg38","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-06T16:29:16Z","updated_at":"2017-03-06T16:29:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"LGTM\r\ntag:mergeready","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/284450044/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/284464941","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1989#issuecomment-284464941","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1989","id":284464941,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NDQ2NDk0MQ==","user":{"login":"serg38","id":16176702,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTc2NzAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16176702?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38","html_url":"https://github.com/serg38","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-06T17:14:54Z","updated_at":"2017-03-06T17:14:54Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@abhinandanprateek

One random example:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n @ActionEvent(eventType = EventTypes.EVENT_VOLUME_UPLOAD, eventDescription = \"uploading volume\", async = true)\r\n    public VolumeVO uploadVolume(UploadVolumeCmd cmd) throws ResourceAllocationException {\r\n        Account caller = CallContext.current().getCallingAccount(); \r\n```\r\nFor more details refer https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/Using+CallContext and commits 7928963 and 11e1e58  which I have mentioned earlier.\r\n\r\nHopefully this clears your doubts.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/284638345/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/284640913","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1859#issuecomment-284640913","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1859","id":284640913,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NDY0MDkxMw==","user":{"login":"nitin-maharana","id":12583725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTgzNzI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12583725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitin-maharana","html_url":"https://github.com/nitin-maharana","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitin-maharana/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitin-maharana/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitin-maharana/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitin-maharana/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitin-maharana/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitin-maharana/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitin-maharana/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitin-maharana/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitin-maharana/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-07T07:12:54Z","updated_at":"2017-03-07T07:12:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Please find the test plan executed from below link(Updated in wiki page).\r\nhttps://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/NCC+Integration+with+CloudStack+Test+Plan\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/284640913/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/284641793","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1991#issuecomment-284641793","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1991","id":284641793,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NDY0MTc5Mw==","user":{"login":"borisstoyanov","id":13551960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTUxOTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13551960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov","html_url":"https://github.com/borisstoyanov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-07T07:18:19Z","updated_at":"2017-03-07T07:18:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"basic zone is not supported currently with BO @karuturi \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/284641793/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
