In cases where boost ignores an error condition to avoid throwing in a destructor, I have instead preferred to abort the process.  My thought process on this is that should mutex destruction return EBUSY or EINVAL, it is a design flaw in the implementation using the Mutex class.  EBUSY means we tried to delete the mutex while it was locked.  EINVAL means it may have been destroyed twice.  In either case, getting a core is way more useful than silently letting the issue pass by in a release build.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/290925332/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/290926843","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/896#issuecomment-290926843","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/896","id":290926843,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MDkyNjg0Mw==","user":{"login":"jeking3","id":11771245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzcxMjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11771245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3","html_url":"https://github.com/jeking3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-01T15:23:46Z","updated_at":"2017-04-01T15:23:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think this should be closed and resubmitted, the history got messed up.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/290926843/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/290942915","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/1082#issuecomment-290942915","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/1082","id":290942915,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MDk0MjkxNQ==","user":{"login":"jeking3","id":11771245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzcxMjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11771245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3","html_url":"https://github.com/jeking3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-01T19:48:11Z","updated_at":"2017-04-01T19:48:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jfarrell the Jira ticket was resolved as \"Won't Fix\" here; can you close this PR?
