A direct way of helping with readability of code which overuses `var` could be to replace `var` with the actual type and draw it in a different color. Could be a toggle button somewhere or hotkey. It would have to switch back to var if the text cursor is over it which complicates things unfortunately I have to admit.\r\n\r\nThis wouldn't change the syntax of the language and wouldn't incentivize overuse of var / change of formatting / create IDE dependence.\r\n\r\nMaybe there is a way to solve those use cases differently so that NB doesn't have to enable inline hints by default (even though the feature itself is probably required anyway since some users might want to have feature parity with other IDEs)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1223983771/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1227249394","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/4054#issuecomment-1227249394","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4054","id":1227249394,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5JJlby","user":{"login":"albilu","id":35330562,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MzMwNTYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35330562?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/albilu","html_url":"https://github.com/albilu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albilu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albilu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albilu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albilu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albilu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albilu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albilu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albilu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albilu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-25T13:19:34Z","updated_at":"2022-08-25T13:19:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hello, facing the same issue since a while.

For example, if we replace `var` with `Map<? extends String, ? extends String>`, the length of the text will be different?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1229403932/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1229463744","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/4554#issuecomment-1229463744","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4554","id":1229463744,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5JSCDA","user":{"login":"blakemcbride","id":6467584,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Njc1ODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6467584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blakemcbride","html_url":"https://github.com/blakemcbride","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blakemcbride/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blakemcbride/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blakemcbride/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blakemcbride/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blakemcbride/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blakemcbride/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blakemcbride/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blakemcbride/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blakemcbride/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-28T13:58:53Z","updated_at":"2022-08-28T14:02:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I ported my app to Java 17.

For example, if we replace `var` with `Map<? extends String, ? extends String>`, the length of the text will be different?\r\n\r\nit would change the formatting too. The differences are in the other aspects as e.g. it doesn't incentivize overuse of var. Replacing var with the type via a toggle would purely work as reading aid, while inline hints change the syntax of the language and change how code is written / incentivize overuse.\r\n\r\nIf var is used correctly, there is no reading aid needed, since:\r\n - it is used in places where the type truly doesn't matter to reduce ceremony as the JEP states\r\n - it can be used where the type is obvious or if its defined somewhere else\r\n - (..)\r\n\r\ne.g to use a Map of Maps with verbose generic types (maybe even with upper or lower bounds) you can simply use var and extract the elements later with the concrete type. Generic declarations can quickly get out of hand - var helps here a lot.\r\n\r\nwhile looking at:\r\n`Path root = manager.getRoot();`\r\n\r\nthe jep would suggest to use a descriptive name when using var, since the type could be anything here:\r\n`var rootPath = manager.getRoot();`\r\n\r\nwith hints this starting to get verbose again:\r\n`var rootPath : Path = manager.getRoot();`\r\n\r\nand a dev might ignore the advice and switch back to a short name since the IDE is providing this info anyway:\r\n`var root : Path = manager.getRoot();`\r\n\r\nfirst of all: this isn't java. Second: the initial version is the most compact and the easiest to read since var is used here in a completely unnecessary situation.\r\n`Path root = manager.getRoot();`\r\n\r\nThats why I spoke out for not enabling it by default (in #4358), and maybe trying to find a better way of providing reading aid for code which overuses var, esp in a way which doesn't influence how the code is written / incentivize overuse. \r\n\r\nE.g. having a toggle which replaces var with the type would not influence how devs write code - it would be a pure reading aid devs could enable it when needed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1230201487/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1230224027","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/4563#issuecomment-1230224027","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4563","id":1230224027,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5JU7qb","user":{"login":"neilcsmith-net","id":3975960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3975960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net","html_url":"https://github.com/neilcsmith-net","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-29T12:32:00Z","updated_at":"2022-08-29T12:32:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"That's not a valid project.
