TVM benefited a lot from Halide's original design and  would definitely want to have clear attributions. See also our recent guidelines in https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/issues/3474\r\n\r\nTo explain why did we miss some of the attribution in the exact place of the code you pointed out. When the code was written from scratch while reflecting the same API semantics of the Halide and other tools such as loopy, we did not add attributions in the exact place of the code. Our original thought was that the attribution in the project page to Loopy and Halide would suffice in these cases. \r\n\r\nThis is of course an oversight and we would like to fix it in whatever way you think is better. Pease also feel free to send in PRs to suggest ways that you think are better.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/524164513/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/524166806","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/3822#issuecomment-524166806","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3822","id":524166806,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNDE2NjgwNg==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-23T04:21:34Z","updated_at":"2019-08-23T04:21:34Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/pull/3824

How about an alternative then? \r\n\r\nIf we dont want to share the InferType (and possibly others in future) among Dialects, Dialect ops will have to write their own InferType functions. For QNN ops, it is a co-incidence that the inferType functionality is same. Currently, there are around 8-10 QNN ops that we are targetting. We can copy paste the infer-type for these ops from Relay to QNN and wrap them in a different function. Here, there is a code duplication, but with much less impact on Relay codebase.

One VTA has a lot of overhead in terms of buffers and serialization, so two VTAs are by construction slower than one bigger VTA that consumes the same resources as the two VTAs as percentage-wise the one big VTA will have many more compute resources than the two smaller VTAs. So going N-wide on the VTA cores will be less optimal than making the core bigger. \r\n\r\nNow, N-wide compute structures do have a benefit in concurrency models that increase capacity. So if you are building a VTA accelerator card for a data center appliance where that server is running many neural network models concurrently, then N-wide VTA cores would make sense. The complexity will be in the software to drive the concurrency as you now need a resource manager and possibly need to introduce core affinity, and secondly, the efficiency of command and memory streams. As you are now cutting the command bw to a core by N you need to rebalance the ISA. And if you are using local memory you will need to design a memory controller that can aggregate reads and writes from the core, just like the GPUs need to do for their processors.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/524811117/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/524811985","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/3781#issuecomment-524811985","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3781","id":524811985,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNDgxMTk4NQ==","user":{"login":"lixiaoquan","id":25603835,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NjAzODM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25603835?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaoquan","html_url":"https://github.com/lixiaoquan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaoquan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaoquan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaoquan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaoquan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaoquan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaoquan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaoquan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaoquan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaoquan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-26T10:40:41Z","updated_at":"2019-08-26T10:40:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It seems not necessary to pass on_value and off_value as tvm.relay.Expr, why not just treat them as attributes?

To do tensorization using TVM, input channel number must be a relatively large one. Otherwise, the compute resource is not going to be efficiently used. Either zero padding has to be done along the input channel dim which will result in low efficiency or the small convolution can't be shifted to VTA. In the first convolution of most image classification networks,  input channel size = 3, thus VTA now can't shift this workload with efficiency. If we keep increasing the core size, there will be more operatiors can't be efficiently shifted.\r\n\r\nHowever, with more cores, we can block the computation with flexibility. If the input channel size is small, but the output channel is large, we can distribute the computation of different output channels to different cores.

We should plan some instrumentation in both the TSIM and the VTA hardware to measure utilization and efficiency during execution. 30 years ago I invented a performance methodology called XUE: for throughput, utilization, and efficiency using the operational analysis notation, and we implemented that methodology in the Intel chip-sets. A decade later, I redid this in the NVIDIA chipsets as well. The patents are now EOL, so we can implement it freely in VTA.\r\n\r\nThe basic idea is simple. using operational analysis, you count all the instructions through the pipeline during some period T. That will give you the throughput, X. At each stage, you also measure if the stage is working on something, or if it is idle. That gives you the utilization, U.  Assume your pipeline has a peak throughput of P. If your pipeline is running at 100% efficiency, you should get U*P = X. However, inefficiency in the data flow due to stalls and bubbles lowers that efficiency, which you can calculate with the ratio E = X / U*P. That in one paragraph is the XUE method.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/524908005/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/524913563","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/3781#issuecomment-524913563","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3781","id":524913563,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNDkxMzU2Mw==","user":{"login":"soiferj","id":3534847,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MzQ4NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3534847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/soiferj","html_url":"https://github.com/soiferj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soiferj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soiferj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soiferj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soiferj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soiferj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soiferj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soiferj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soiferj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soiferj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-26T15:46:17Z","updated_at":"2019-08-26T15:46:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The on_value and off_value can be any data type.

As long as we implement all the features, please feel free to remove the old vulkan runtime.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/525994251/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/525998305","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/3833#issuecomment-525998305","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3833","id":525998305,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNTk5ODMwNQ==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-29T02:45:58Z","updated_at":"2019-08-29T02:45:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for great discussions, the community uses https://discuss.tvm.ai/ for general developing discussions, please move the discussion thread there :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/525998305/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/526000820","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/3676#issuecomment-526000820","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3676","id":526000820,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNjAwMDgyMA==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-29T02:59:21Z","updated_at":"2019-08-29T02:59:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks @lixiaoquan @kazum !","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/526000820/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/526001445","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/3783#issuecomment-526001445","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3783","id":526001445,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNjAwMTQ0NQ==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-29T03:02:47Z","updated_at":"2019-08-29T03:02:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"OK, I am fine with either way. @yzhliu @zhiics please try to summarize the discussion and suggest a path forward.
