A couple comments from a UX perspective:\n1. We need to bring the button to trigger the modal closer to the row of the cursor. To the left of the column where the error indicator lives seems viable. (We can't put it in the same column as the error indicator b/c we need to be able to allow the user to pop up the editor for a value that has an error.)\n2. The button should only appear on the row where the cursor is. (In other words, we shouldn't see an icon next to every row.)\n3. Would prefer an alt-edit or a modal icon, rather than a keyboard. Keyboard isn't precise enough, as every edit action inside the editor involves the keyboard. One could make the same argument against an edit icon, so an alt-edit (something custom, probably) or a modal/window icon could work.\n\nQuestions:\n1. Will the editor pop up even when a user has an error? For example, what about a value that doesn't have a closing quote? Will the user have to use ACE to fix that before popping the value editor?\n2. What happens when a user has selected with her cursor more than one value (ie more than one row)? Does the editor icon not appear?\n3. Can the editor in the value editor be an ACE editor, also? \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/46872912/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/46874623","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/248#issuecomment-46874623","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/248","id":46874623,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2ODc0NjIz","user":{"login":"garrensmith","id":179458,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTQ1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/179458?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith","html_url":"https://github.com/garrensmith","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-06-23T17:20:36Z","updated_at":"2014-06-23T17:20:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@robertkowalski and @kxepal, @seanbarclay has fixed the issue.

Reason being that the string gets unquoted - and a wrong string can yield surprising / unpredictable results and really mess up the JSON editor. And indeed: icon-edit (fa-edit in FontAwesome) does look better, I've include this one instead of the keyboard. So far I'm turning the icon into disabled state when either several lines are selected or the cursor / selection is on a line without a string. \nConcerning the idea of putting the icon besides the line (somewhat like a SmartTag in some office suites ;-) ): I'm not sure and I also have no real opinion just yet (as e.g. the button would come closer but you start chasing it like a SmartTag; as the button gets to where your eyes are but outside the toolbar where buttons are not unexpected). Just not sure. Let me / let us all put some more thought into this one\nBesides: I have to figure out how to do this anyway (by positioning, by css class like the error icon, by some other way, ...), so maybe we get some more feedback on this in parallel\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/46887185/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/46889945","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/251#issuecomment-46889945","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/251","id":46889945,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2ODg5OTQ1","user":{"login":"seanbarclay","id":181646,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTY0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/181646?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanbarclay","html_url":"https://github.com/seanbarclay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanbarclay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanbarclay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanbarclay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanbarclay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanbarclay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanbarclay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanbarclay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanbarclay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanbarclay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-06-23T19:25:38Z","updated_at":"2014-06-23T19:25:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"To piggyback on what @bradnoble was saying- you could display an \"Edit\" or Pencil icon on the far right on the same line, to indicate you can edit that line content.

Technically, colours are the same, but they looks and feel differently due to surrounding elements. Suddenly, we couldn't fix our brain and colour recognition, but we can hack design to let it looks more consistent.\n- New sidebar doesn't updates API URL for Design Doc Metadata item. Btw, this actually view index info.\n- May be move New doc and New index items from submenu  on the sidebar? It doesn't always figure where they are while both are more common operations rather then Permissions and Compaction.\n- May be rename accordion item view to Views? And don't show it if there are no any views for specified ddoc.\n- Idea: may be instead of having Design Doc Metadata and collapsed Views accordion items have single menu item Views and on click by it show View Index Info and list of all available views on main working frame (where view results get rendered)?

Looking forward 2 your feedback!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/48240400/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/48463679","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/258#issuecomment-48463679","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/258","id":48463679,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NDYzNjc5","user":{"login":"rnewson","id":47223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson","html_url":"https://github.com/rnewson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-09T12:34:39Z","updated_at":"2014-07-09T12:34:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"We should add a supervising service agnostic approach here.

I think if people are building CouchDB from source we can expect that they have the needed dependencies installed. And this is well documented, too.\n\nAdditionally I think that the problem regarding the missing docs during a build from source, without the dependencies needed to create them, is a separate task. In this patch I want to solve the problem that the latest docs are linked in Fauxton. \n\nAnother reason against linking the online docs is that folks behind firewalls are getting problems with a link to the online docs.\n\nThe behavior change introduced in the current patch is the same behavior that Futon currently has.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/48637964/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/48638541","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/232#issuecomment-48638541","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/232","id":48638541,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NjM4NTQx","user":{"login":"KlausTrainer","id":230061,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDA2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KlausTrainer","html_url":"https://github.com/KlausTrainer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KlausTrainer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KlausTrainer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KlausTrainer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KlausTrainer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KlausTrainer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KlausTrainer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KlausTrainer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KlausTrainer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KlausTrainer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-10T17:43:05Z","updated_at":"2014-07-10T17:43:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1\n\nGood
