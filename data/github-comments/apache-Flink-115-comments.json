The `setRegion` function on the AWS Kinesis client calculates the endpoint URL from the region name and sets it on the client. The `setEndpoint` function is meant to allow for testing against non-AWS endpoints, or even new AWS endpoints in Regions unrecognized by an older version of the library.\n\nI think that requiring the AWS region, and optionally using the AWS endpoint if provided, will work well; this is consistent with the AWS client's own behavior.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/232039252/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/232041947","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2192#issuecomment-232041947","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2192","id":232041947,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMjA0MTk0Nw==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-12T13:09:41Z","updated_at":"2016-07-12T13:09:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Good idea in general.\nI would use variables for all versions used more than once.

Also, from the original discussion / comments in the JIRA, the Kafka API doesn't seem to have changed between 0.9 and 0.10, so it might be possible to let the Kafka 0.9 connector use the 0.10 client by putting the Kafka 0.10 dependency into the user pom.\n\nMay I ask whether you have tried this approach out already? Also,\n\n> At The Weather Company we bumped into a problem while trying to use Flink with Kafka 0.10.x.\n\nWhat was the problem? If you can describe, it'll be helpful for deciding how we can proceed with this :) There's another contributor who was trying this out, I'll also try to ask for his feedback on this in the

`wait $mypid` or just `wait` works for me if I `./bin/jobmanager.sh start cluster` (jobmanager starts in foreground), then in another terminal `./bin/jobmanager.sh stop` and both terminals are now at the command prompt.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/232788827/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/232795318","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2249#issuecomment-232795318","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2249","id":232795318,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMjc5NTMxOA==","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-14T21:17:53Z","updated_at":"2016-07-14T21:17:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Please

This is great and i could see the metrics in JMX.  I have one more question on interoperability of Accumulators and Metrics.  As per my understanding, currently Metrics are only available at system level , and User Accumulators are available to Job writers.  Is there any plan for supporting Metrics for Job writers? Metrics give much more capabilities than current Accumulators and would be a great way to track custom metrics at each operator level? \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/232834220/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
