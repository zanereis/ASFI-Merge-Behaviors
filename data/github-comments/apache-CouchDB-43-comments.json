@eiri \r\nThanks for the explanation, it clarified this issue for me. One more question though :)\r\nI know that you are going to remove `seq` and `kseq` b-tree logic completely from the `mrview` according to dev mailing list, but unfortunately we have to stick to this \"broken\" implementation for now in our own fork until proper implementation will be re-introduced (I mentioned reasons in the previous comment). So I'm curious is it possible to re-implement `Seq` index a little bit and instead of\r\n```erlang\r\n{Seq, Key} -> {DocID, EmittedValue, DocRev}\r\n```\r\nhave something akin to:\r\n```erlang\r\n{Seq, phash2(Key)} -> {DocID, EmittedValue, DocRev}\r\n```\r\nfor a better performance? Since we only care about the order by `seq` in case of `Seq` index and here we need `Key` only to deduplicate stuff, unlike in `KeyBySeq` index where a particular `Key` matters.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/378597834/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/378645557","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/1142#issuecomment-378645557","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1142","id":378645557,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3ODY0NTU1Nw==","user":{"login":"eiri","id":70542,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNTQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70542?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiri","html_url":"https://github.com/eiri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiri/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-04T15:38:46Z","updated_at":"2018-04-04T15:38:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> So I'm curious is it possible to re-implement Seq index a little bit...\r\n\r\nProbably, maybe?.. I don't know, to be honest, I haven't thought too hard about it. Setting custom `less` on `seq_btree` feels like a less hacky approach to me and I'd simply serialize key to binary to take a randomness of hashing out of the equation.\r\n\r\nI presume the keys were used on seq btree because a view can emit multiple keys per db update. Which, I imagine, would give a duplicated entires in `_changed` feed when filtering used, no idea how replicator suppose to handle that.\r\n\r\nHonestly I'd be very wary of using a known broken feature in a production even if it works in a small subset of the tests and talking from experience migrating production views from fork to upstream, especially when file format changed, is a _huge_ PITA. But that's your call, obviously, I don't see this feature to get into active development too soon.

I can't think about any other alternatives to `fast_view`. Before this we tried to use mango selectors with some hackery on the `nginx` side to make `Couchbase Lite` replication work, but unfortunately selectors also are too slow and have [some other issues](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/1151). Simply avoiding using `seq` and `kseq` indexes proved to be outright slow and completely unusable in production scale.

Perhaps if we do that we can make an arbitrary \"engine_info\" key that allows storage engines to expose any data they might feel like having there?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/380131597/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/380415007","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/1184#issuecomment-380415007","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1184","id":380415007,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MDQxNTAwNw==","user":{"login":"jareware","id":560055,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MDA1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/560055?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jareware","html_url":"https://github.com/jareware","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jareware/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jareware/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jareware/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jareware/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jareware/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jareware/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jareware/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jareware/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jareware/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-11T11:10:45Z","updated_at":"2018-04-11T11:10:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Also ran into this issue:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{ error: 'unknown_error',\r\n  reason: 'badarg',\r\n  ref: 4258677272,\r\n  name: 'unknown_error',\r\n  status: 500,\r\n  message: 'badarg' }\r\n```\r\n\r\nLooking at the DB logs around that time:\r\n\r\n```\r\nApr 11 13:58:11 [error] 2018-04-11T10:58:10.848863Z nonode@nohost <0.2276.41> 59b7147c82 rexi_server: from: nonode@nohost(<0.2106.41>) mfa: fabric_rpc:update_docs/3 exit:{timeout,{gen_server,call,[couch_proc_manager,{get_proc,{doc,<<\"_design/myUpdateValidation\">>,{1,[<<100,39,93,199,51,195,88,67,22,50,78,244,160,45,176,213>>]},{[{<<\"validate_doc_update\">>,<<\"function (newDoc, oldDoc, userCtx) { /* redacted */ }\">>}]},[],false,[]},{<<\"_design/myUpdateValidation\">>,<<\"1-64275dc733c3584316324ef4a02db0d5\">>}},5000]}} [{gen_server,call,3,[{file,\"gen_server.erl\"},{line,190}]},{couch_query_servers,get_ddoc_process,2,[{file,\"src/couch_query_servers.erl\"},{line,498}]},{couch_query_servers,with_ddoc_proc,2,[{file,\"src/couch_query_servers.erl\"},{line,463}]},{couch_query_servers,validate_doc_update,5,[{file,\"src/couch_query_servers.erl\"},{line,318}]},{couch_db,'-validate_doc_update_int/3-lc$^0/1-0-',5,[{file,\"src/couch_db.erl\"},{line,784}]},{couch_db,'-validate_doc_update_int/3-fun-0-',3,[{file,\"src/couch_db.erl\"},{line,784}]},{couch_stats,update_histogram,2,[{file,\"src/couch_stats.erl\"},{line,102}]},{couch_db,'-prep_and_validate_updates/6-fun-1-',3,[{file,\"src/couch_db.erl\"},{line,878}]}] \r\nApr 11 13:58:11 [error] 2018-04-11T10:58:10.862568Z nonode@nohost <0.2106.41> 59b7147c82 req_err(4258677272) unknown_error : badarg \r\nApr 11 13:58:11     [<<\"dict:fetch/2 L130\">>,<<\"couch_util:-reorder_results/2-lc$^1/1-1-/2 L456\">>,<<\"fabric_doc_update:go/3 L41\">>,<<\"fabric:update_docs/3 L259\">>,<<\"chttpd_db:db_req/2 L428\">>,<<\"chttpd:process_request/1 L295\">>,<<\"chttpd:handle_request_int/1 L231\">>,<<\"mochiweb_http:headers/6 L91\">>] \r\nApr 11 13:58:11 [error] 2018-04-11T10:58:10.863338Z nonode@nohost <0.2305.41> -------- CRASH REPORT Process  (<0.2305.41>) with 1 neighbors exited with reason: bad return value {os_process_error,\"OS process timed out.\"} at gen_server:init_it/6(line:334) <= proc_lib:init_p_do_apply/3(line:237);

If an update validator function takes too long, os process will throw timeout, but the whole batch will be processed nevertheless. It seems that in 2.1.1 that timeout from the update validator was swallowed up the pipe and an attempt to fetch the missing key on reorder was throwing an exception.\r\n\r\nEvidently it was fixed since then. I can't pinpoint where that happened, but when I run the same case on current master it handles the error fine:\r\n```json\r\n...\r\n   {\r\n        \"id\": \"1719307e8c6a14bc1f89f6e9570612bd\", \r\n        \"ok\": true, \r\n        \"rev\": \"1-1aefbf37f7524ef1d7708843e035d128\"\r\n    }, \r\n    {\r\n        \"error\": \"os_process_error\", \r\n        \"id\":

  \"rev\": \"1-ca8a74b9258d00dc126bbae88ab1844f\"\r\n    }, \r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis can be reproduces with validation fun looking something like this.\r\n```javascript\r\nfunction(newDoc, oldDoc, userCtx) {\r\n  if (newDoc.timeout) {\r\n    var now = new Date().getTime();\r\n    while(new Date().getTime() < now + 60000) { }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe bulk's payload needs to be larger than 100 docs and have at least one doc with field `\"timeout\": true`.\r\n\r\nNote, that the config parameter `[couch_httpd_auth]` `timeout` not really related to this, os process timeout configured by `[couchdb]` `os_process_timeout` and is 5 seconds by default.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/380493233/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/380580320","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/1278#issuecomment-380580320","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1278","id":380580320,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MDU4MDMyMA==","user":{"login":"chewbranca","id":5326,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5326?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chewbranca","html_url":"https://github.com/chewbranca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chewbranca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chewbranca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chewbranca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chewbranca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chewbranca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chewbranca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chewbranca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chewbranca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chewbranca/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-11T20:10:40Z","updated_at":"2018-04-11T20:10:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"First
