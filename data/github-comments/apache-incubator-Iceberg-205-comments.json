 Hmm I guess it depends on what \"correct\" behavior means here, but if the partition stats reflect values that can never be returned in a query (because the files containing those values have been deleted), then that seems incorrect to me.\r\n\r\nAnd changing the behavior would be a perf improvement, particularly when the manifests are quite large, as they are in our use case.  Filtering using the partition stats at the manifest list level means certain manifests don't have to be read.  With incorrect partition stats, the manifests are read even when they don't have any files that can answer the query.\r\n\r\nAgree that a mode to simply drop files rather than keep references would solve the problem.  But then I would ask, what's the functionality of keeping around deleted files in the manifests with \"Status: 2\" (deleted) ?

Really excited to see the contribution! Just a question, I think we would like to promote people to use the Rest catalog implementation instead of having more catalog implementations. Is that approach considered? Is there any issue for Snowflake to go with that approach?\r\n\r\nI'm very excited to see this work as well, thank you for the contribution @manisin!\r\n\r\nWhile this is very exciting to me as I've worked on the catalog API a good bit and it would also be good for the community for this to be open source, I'm also curious if the REST API would be able to fulfill these needs. There are a number of things that can be standardized for performance improvements and general capabilities at the catalog level that way (e.g. holding locks, etc).\r\n\r\nBut mostly, thank you again for this contribution. It will be beneficial for people to be able to integrate with snowflake without too many dependency concerns and with open source code. 😄

However, I worry the new behavior may cause performance regressions in some cases as we will generate more splits (even though we may not benefit from any join optimizations). Do we want to expose a way to force combining files across partitions (i.e. old behavior)? There are two ways to support that: either add a read option in Iceberg or try checking if storage-partitioned joins are enabled in Spark SQL (if not, we can safely combine). Since Spark will pass join attributes in the future, adding a read option does not seem preferable. Any thoughts?\r\n\r\nAs discussed offline, this adds a Spark SQL conf: `spark.sql.iceberg.splits-by-partition`, to dictate whether we should combine splits across partition boundaries in Iceberg. There's work planned on Spark side to add APIs and pass the info to Iceberg, which is a better solution and will eventually supersede this approach.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1283000536/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1283007514","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/6001#issuecomment-1283007514","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/6001","id":1283007514,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85MeSQa","user":{"login":"stevenzwu","id":1545663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDU2NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1545663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu","html_url":"https://github.com/stevenzwu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-18T21:10:27Z","updated_at":"2022-10-18T21:10:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @nastra for fixing the problem and adding an smoke test for the runtime module.
