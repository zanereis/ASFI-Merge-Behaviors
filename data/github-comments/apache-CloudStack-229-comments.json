job on finally opening the PR Sachin. Can you do a few things first:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Create a JIRA ticket at issues.apache.org Under the `Cloudstack` project giving a basic overview of your change (you can basically copy paste the description from here)\r\n2. Rename the PR from `http Handler` to a more descriptive message like `[CLOUDSTACK-<jiraID>] Adding Support for NoVNC Console for KVM`\r\n3. Rebase all your commits to a single commit.\r\n4. Make sure the new files that you have added (for example the NoVNC websocket handler) have the apache licence at the top. You can look at any other java file and copy the licence from there. Note that this only applies to the files that *you* have created, not the ones that you got from the noVNC project.\r\n5. Finally, give a little more description about your approach and how you are proxying the websocket connection and the change to replace the `HttpHandler` with `Jetty`\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/318524162/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/318529057","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/2190#issuecomment-318529057","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/2190","id":318529057,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxODUyOTA1Nw==","user":{"login":"blueorangutan","id":16489489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDg5NDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16489489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan","html_url":"https://github.com/blueorangutan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-28T01:12:35Z","updated_at":"2017-07-28T01:12:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<b>Trillian
