I’m not clear about your situation, The situation that the memory leak is that the trace isn't finished, and the `StackDepth` don’t remove from thread local. And the issue maybe caused by two thread had to share the StackDepth variable.\r\n\r\n1.  The code of I added in this PR is after the traceContext be finished.\r\n2.  `StackDepth` in springmvc plugin had store in thread local, and also you later discovered it.\r\n3.   you do not need to worry share thread in threadLocal variable.\r\n\r\n> wu-sheng: RunningContext only closes when TracingContext close. Can't do like this.\r\n\r\nthis is original code of  `skywalking/master`:\r\n``` java\r\n //ContextManager.stopSpan() : \r\n    public static void stopSpan(AbstractSpan span) {\r\n        if (get().stopSpan(span)) {\r\n            CONTEXT.remove();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n// TraceContext().stopSpan(span) : \r\n    public boolean stopSpan(AbstractSpan span) {\r\n        AbstractSpan lastSpan = peek();\r\n        if (lastSpan == span) {\r\n            if (lastSpan instanceof AbstractTracingSpan) {\r\n                AbstractTracingSpan toFinishSpan = (AbstractTracingSpan)lastSpan;\r\n                if (toFinishSpan.finish(segment)) {\r\n                    pop();\r\n                }\r\n            } else {\r\n                pop();\r\n            }\r\n        } else {\r\n            throw new IllegalStateException(\"Stopping the unexpected span = \" + span);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        if (checkFinishConditions()) {\r\n            finish();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        return activeSpanStack.isEmpty();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n// checkFinishConditions(): \r\nprivate boolean checkFinishConditions() {\r\n        if (isRunningInAsyncMode) {\r\n            asyncFinishLock.lock();\r\n        }\r\n        try {\r\n            if (activeSpanStack.isEmpty() && asyncSpanCounter.get() == 0) {\r\n                return true;\r\n            }\r\n        } finally {\r\n            if (isRunningInAsyncMode) {\r\n                asyncFinishLock.unlock();\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        return false;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n```\r\n**Read this original sourceCode and you will find that CONTEXT.remove() is executed after TraceContext finished，**if  RUNTIME_CONTEXT.remove() after CONTEXT.remove(),I don't think there has any problem, and add this line is required. \r\n I searched globally for used by RUNTIME_CONTEXT in project, it never be  removed**.It has a risk of out of memory.** Theadlocal is best to  execute remove() after use completed in current Thread. I believe that if there is no RUNTIME_CONTEXT be added in this place, there will be other business bug , but we have not found it now.\r\n\r\nby my changes, I tested a day on my team’s project yesterday，did not find any questions for this change, and it solved the spring plugin's bug of this PR point(we don't use tomcat、undertow or jetty-server plugins,because there is an imperfection about display of operation-name of  restful-api 。).\r\n\r\nI didn't want to reply because this PR was closed. I reply it  because I think the technology should be stricter.\r\n\r\nThanks for listening. @wu-sheng @ascrutae ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/499330998/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/499348641","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/2750#issuecomment-499348641","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/2750","id":499348641,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5OTM0ODY0MQ==","user":{"login":"zhaoyuguang","id":10150229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTUwMjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10150229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaoyuguang","html_url":"https://github.com/zhaoyuguang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaoyuguang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaoyuguang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaoyuguang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaoyuguang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaoyuguang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaoyuguang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaoyuguang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaoyuguang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaoyuguang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-06T04:59:22Z","updated_at":"2019-06-06T04:59:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@karott I fixed the problem of `mdc` array out of bounds, can you try again?

Some point were left out:\r\n> -handleRetryRollbacking\r\n> -handleRetryCommitting\r\n> -handleAsyncCommitting\r\n> -LockManager\r\n\r\nHi @CoffeeLatte007 , thanks for reviewing, the `LockManager` instrumentation is added(as the trace below.\r\n\r\nAs for the three `handleXxx` methods, they are indeed not instrumented, but the underlying operations (`BranchCommit`, `BranchRollback`) are

\r\n\r\nTo follow up after a whole night of debugging, I have found something. I do not know how to solve it, but certain internet networks can have a firewall configured that can block a specific port and not allow downloads for specific packages. I have found some solutions for other applications and tutorials where people have the same error:\r\n```ruby \r\nFailed to execute goal com.github.eirslett:frontend-maven-plugin:1.6:npm (npm run build)\r\n```\r\nwhich involve opening a specific port to allow this plugin to be downloaded, but I do not know enough about networking to suggest this at my work. \r\n\r\nI fixed this by trying to compile at home, which had no problems. This network problem is unfortunately obfuscated by the not-so-helpful error messaging.\r\n\r\nI know this is a common issue for many people from seeing the issues here, so I suggest to anyone if you do run into this issue to not fret and reinstall your node, npm versions etc. First try it on another network.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/500657984/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/500661422","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/2848#issuecomment-500661422","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/2848","id":500661422,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMDY2MTQyMg==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-11T02:24:46Z","updated_at":"2019-06-11T02:24:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This should have been fixed in master.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/500661422/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/500661717","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/2849#issuecomment-500661717","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/2849","id":500661717,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMDY2MTcxNw==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-11T02:25:54Z","updated_at":"2019-06-11T02:25:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"We have this class in agent jar, you could check.
