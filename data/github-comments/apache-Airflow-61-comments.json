I still see a lot of redundancy between those 2 config groups - i.e. a lot of fields with the same values. However, this is a great start. \n\nOne suggestion. The function test_mode() can easily be confused with the variable of the same name, which can be found in various places like models.py (e.g. Task_instance states are not recorded in the db for test_mode). test_mode is set when someone calls \"airflow test\" using the CLI. \n\nPeople may confuse this method with returning a boolean of whether or code is being run via \"airflow test\". In light of that, I suggest changing the name of our method to something like configure_for_test().\n\nThat's my only concern. Also, the commit messages are a hair over 50 characters.

However if a previous dagrun exists this dagrun will be used. In case of a scheduled dagrun it will not be rewritten to a backfill run-id. This will need to be addressed separately. Probably some discussion is required on the approach.

It sees that the object is not a unicode and first try to implicitly coerce it into unicode (which works since it's ascii by default) and then encode it into string... I think the reason I did this was because I was hitting unicode errors during testing for some reason with data that were passed in, but I cannot recall exactly.\n\nI do agree that for this to be python3 compatible we should not be encoding it. As long as removing the encode will still work with 2, Im more than happy for the change!

just started to look at this same issue -- thanks for fixing.  One suggestion would be to change the `schema='default'` argument for all the `get_*` functions to `schema=None` (e.g., [here](https://github.com/devonberry/incubator-airflow/blob/aebbd6c381fda40f801fb8b04c380ce9f137d918/airflow/hooks/hive_hooks.py#L599)).\nOtherwise, users would have to do something like `get_data(hql, schema=None)` to get the existing behavior.  That is, the new implementation will use `'default'` as the schema, even if the stored db connection specifies a different schema.  I was also a little unsure of whether it was ok to add arguments to `get_conn` since this is an implementation of a BaseHook function which takes no arguments.\n\nFor reference, here is what I had started with: https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/compare/master...askeys:hiveserver2_implement_schema_argument\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/240525758/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/240525775","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1743#issuecomment-240525775","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1743","id":240525775,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MDUyNTc3NQ==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-17T19:47:38Z","updated_at":"2016-08-17T19:47:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## [Current coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/1743?src=pr) is 64.69% (diff: 33.33%)\n\n> Merging [#1743](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/1743?src=pr) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/branch/master?src=pr) will decrease coverage by **0.01%**\n\n``` diff\n@@             master      #1743   diff @@\n==========================================\n  Files           127        127          \n  Lines          9498       9498          \n  Methods           0          0          \n  Messages          0          0          \n  Branches          0          0          \n==========================================\n- Hits           6146       6145     -1   \n- Misses         3352       3353     +1   \n  Partials          0          0          \n```\n\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io?src=pr).

I tested the test cases included in JIRA on the commit right before this PR, and the test case behaved as expected. I am not sure what is the best way to achieve what this PR does while avoiding the bug.
