Mike McCandless did tests on Linux (he has a machine that he hardly switched off in a loop with remote hardware power plug) and he tested it: When machine came up, index was still alive (he tested Linux).\n\nFsync on directory flushes the file buffers of the directory _\\+ its metadata_. The first one is also done by syncing metadata of a file contained, yes that works, but the directory's metadata is not necessarily written. Because of that it could happen that the inode of the directory is there, but the entry in the parent directory not yet (because the directory's metadata was not yet synced). After hard kill of machine, the fsck will report a lost+found inode (the directory). Because of the lost dir entry, the directory itsself is not visible in its parent.\n\nI would still try to fsync also in windows, maybe it works at some time.
