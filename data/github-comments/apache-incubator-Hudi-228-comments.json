Thanks for the great writeup.  I have a couple of thoughts/questions from an external perspective.\r\n\r\n- Should we name this blog to explicitly mention as Asynchronous metadata indexing using Hudi. This will avoid confusion with the current indexing concept here for users - https://hudi.apache.org/docs/indexing ?\r\n- Also I see that we have a category of `Services` in our Docs. There is a page for clustering, compaction, etc in there. Since this is one of the table services, should we also add a page on metadata indexing under `Services`. It can have a brief description and point to this blog for detailed content. \r\n-  One last thing is, seeing the description, I also wanted to understand what happens if we disable `hoodie.metadata.index.async` . What is the behavior then ? Does it run inline  ? What are the implications. It would be good to see those explained as well. \r\n\r\nLet me know your thoughts.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1112726886/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1112728730","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/5280#issuecomment-1112728730","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/5280","id":1112728730,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5CUuSa","user":{"login":"yihua","id":2497195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTcxOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2497195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua","html_url":"https://github.com/yihua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-28T22:57:58Z","updated_at":"2022-04-28T22:57:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@arunb2w If you don't need Hadoop or Hive specifically, you can compile Hudi jars and use Spark to write Hudi table to the local file system.

For the former case, you can directly use `spark.read.format(\"org.apache.hudi\").load(\"s3://bucket/folder\")` to read the whole table.  If both `s3://bucket/folder/cluster=abc/` and `s3://bucket/folder/cluster=efg/` are separate Hudi tables, the behavior of reading them both in one `spark.read.format(\"org.apache.hudi\")` statement is undefined, since usually there is no such use case.  You may still run multiple reads and union the dataframes to get one dataframe:\r\n```\r\ndf1 = spark.read.format(\"org.apache.hudi\").load(\"s3://bucket/folder/cluster=abc\")\r\ndf2 = spark.read.format(\"org.apache.hudi\").load(\"s3://bucket/folder/cluster=efg\")\r\ndf3 = df1.union(df2)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that, the glob pattern to find all parquet files in a Hudi table to load them is deprecated, so you can just use the Hudi table base path to read all data.  Hudi maintains the format of data written to parquet files, and manually globbing selective parquet files to read may lead to unexpected behavior.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1113827711/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1113834072","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/5198#issuecomment-1113834072","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/5198","id":1113834072,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5CY8JY","user":{"login":"yihua","id":2497195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTcxOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2497195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua","html_url":"https://github.com/yihua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-29T22:33:00Z","updated_at":"2022-04-29T22:33:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@babumahesh-koo Sg.

@codope I read through the blog. Thanks for the great writeup. I have a couple of thoughts/questions from an external perspective.\r\n> \r\n> * Should we name this blog to explicitly mention as Asynchronous metadata indexing using Hudi. This will avoid confusion with the current indexing concept here for users - https://hudi.apache.org/docs/indexing ?\r\n> * Also I see that we have a category of `Services` in our Docs. There is a page for clustering, compaction, etc in there. Since this is one of the table services, should we also add a page on metadata indexing under `Services`. It can have a brief description and point to this blog for detailed content.\r\n> * One last thing is, seeing the description, I also wanted to understand what happens if we disable `hoodie.metadata.index.async` . What is the behavior then ? Does it run inline  ? What are the implications. It would be good to see those explained as well.\r\n> \r\n> Let me know your thoughts.\r\n\r\nGood points @bhasudha \r\n\r\nI have moved the setup and usage related sections to a separate page under `Services` tab,  check out #5476 \r\nI need to do some more work on this blog. I will rename, add more design elements and diagram. If async indexing is disabled with any of the index types enabled then those metadata partitions will be created/updated synchronously. Added this line in caveat section in #5476 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1113976714/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1113977124","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/5476#issuecomment-1113977124","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/5476","id":1113977124,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5CZfEk","user":{"login":"codope","id":16440354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQwMzU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16440354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope","html_url":"https://github.com/codope","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-30T12:04:53Z","updated_at":"2022-04-30T12:04:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@nsivabalan @bhasudha @xushiyan Added this guide to go under `Services` tab.
