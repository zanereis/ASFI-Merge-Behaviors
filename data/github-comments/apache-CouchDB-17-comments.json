Can you share the link to dev list please?\n\n@dch reason I'm asking is because I'm trying to update a [recipe](https://github.com/gmile/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/couchdb.rb) on homebrew. It appears so that all homebrew users are stuck with 1.6.1 forever (more than a year now). I do see an [old commit](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/commit/5cefb216b27d60772738458e9af411710676ccd4#diff-ccdcb18cac44281832236416670515d9R10) from yours fixing support for erlang R18.0 and all I wanted is to expand support to 19.0 as well.\n\nI was hoping to update the couchdb recipe so that it'd unblock another issue, related to upgrading Erlang recipe on homebrew to 19.0. There's an evidence that updating erlang will break current couchdb 1.6.1 installation on homebrew.\n\nI saw a few options to resolve the issue with erlang recipe:\n1. update the text of your patch directly (which I did in https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/2891) (it kind of feels wrong and dishonest to update someone's code, given your credentials in the text of that patch, but if it's OK with you – maybe it's the quickest way forward?),\n2. do it _the proper way_™, and patch the 1.6.x branch first (which I'm aimed at here, with this PR), and then override the text of your patch with the text of my patch, including overriding the credentials (this didn't work, see last edit to [this comment](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/2891#issuecomment-231862749)),\n3. do it even more proper way, tag a latest stable 1.x.x (1.6.x?) release, and cleanup homebrew recipes

\n\nThe problem is the setting is really a tri-state switch of \"disabled\", \"warning\", \"enabled\". SELinux setup on RHEL works the same (disabled, permissive, where it logs but don't block access, and enabled where it blocks access). And the reason I kept existing setting is for backward compatibility, so users don't have to re-write or port their config files.\n\nSomething like `reduce_limit_debug = true | false` needs an explanation how it interacts with `reduce_limit`. For example reduce `reduce_limit_debug` would only work with `reduce_limit = false`, which is not intuitive. When `reduce_limit = true` there is not much need to log as it already blows up and user will find out.\n\n@rnewson Any thoughts on this?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/236660355/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/236661327","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/425#issuecomment-236661327","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/425","id":236661327,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNjY2MTMyNw==","user":{"login":"kxepal","id":785983,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NTk4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/785983?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal","html_url":"https://github.com/kxepal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-01T18:14:54Z","updated_at":"2016-08-01T18:14:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@nickva \nHmm....ok.
