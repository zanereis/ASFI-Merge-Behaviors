the code. but the config of `.prettier.js` and `.eslintrc.js` conflict beause of `quotes` and `comma-dangle` rule is not effect in `.eslintrc.js`. by the way don't you report errors when you execute `npm run lint` locally? @songjianet\r\n> \r\n> Yes, currently we have three people developing the new `ui`, and they can run normally using `webstorm` and `vscode` respectively.\r\n\r\nThans for your answer，but I find `eslint-config-prettier` can't found `pretter`'s config, bease of `.pretter.js` is not support for `pretter`. the official profile names supported are as follows:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8847400/147881272-bf41b4f4-a400-4ec7-b02b-1d231fb03690.png).\r\nYou can run `npm run prettier` correctly because the configuration file name is specified by the `--config` parameter.\r\nbut `eslint` can't recognize it.\r\nIn addition the code has other obvious styles for `eslint`. examples:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8847400/147881429-5818dee8-d0a8-4bab-8807-f6b84f0776d6.png)\r\nthis file is `veiws/home/index.tsx`.\r\nBased on these I don't think you can run `npm run lint` without reporting errors. \r\nHope your reply @songjianet
