The problem here is that `Reduce`'s `accept` gives a fatal error. (ir.cc) Why do we have two visitor styles? And why Reduce shouldn't work with the old style?\r\n\r\nSecond attempt: I tried to implement your idea above. I guess I need to use `IRMutator` and `mutate` instead of `IRVisitor` and `visit` since `visit` doesn't return a value as you show in your snippet. \r\nI am thinking of Halide::Internal::IRMutator::mutate like this:\r\n```c++\r\nExpr IRMutator::mutate(Expr e) {\r\n    if (e.defined()) {\r\n        Expr e2 = callback(this, e);\r\n        if (e2.defined())\r\n          expr = e2;\r\n        else\r\n          e.accept(this);\r\n    } else {\r\n        expr = Expr();\r\n    }\r\n    stmt = Stmt();\r\n    return expr;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIn which `callback` is a function that you have given an example of above, i.e., makes a `Reduce` node with `visit`ed children if it's a `Reduce` op at the top, otherwise return `Expr()`. I also need to get `callback` defined in IRMutator. Also we need a `callback` overloaded for `Stmt`. Is this what you had in mind? \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/353186088/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/353209561","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/715#issuecomment-353209561","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/715","id":353209561,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MzIwOTU2MQ==","user":{"login":"taknevski","id":7050189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNTAxODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7050189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/taknevski","html_url":"https://github.com/taknevski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taknevski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taknevski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taknevski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taknevski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taknevski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taknevski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taknevski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taknevski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taknevski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-20T23:09:14Z","updated_at":"2017-12-20T23:09:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Probably using the cross compile mechanism specifying the llvm target with the fma  flag would sort out this problem.
