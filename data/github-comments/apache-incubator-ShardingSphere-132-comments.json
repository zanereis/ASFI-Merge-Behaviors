@tristaZero \r\nThis is a good idea, but there are some problems：\r\nAfter my master library failed,MySQL Group Replication will automatically switch a slave master library, which can read and write, but the slave library configured in shardingsphere-JDBC can only read, how can I automatically change the state of this slave library accordingly, changing the read-only state to read and write state？\r\n\r\n这是一个好的想法，但是还存在以下问题:\r\n我的主库故障后，MySQL Group Replication会自动切换一个从库为主库，此时这个从库可以读写，但是我在shardingsphere-jdbc里面当时配置的这个从库只能读，怎么才能相应的对这个从库自动变更状态，将只读状态变更为读写状态？\r\n\r\n
