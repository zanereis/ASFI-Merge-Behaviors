I think it's good to have it even if you are maybe the only one that can run it. I mean, you could be the \"gate keeper\" for the stability and reliability of the SolidFire plugin, and report on the test you run.\n\nI haven't looked in detail at the test, but I'm definitely very happy to see it as part of this PR. One suggestion that I make (and it's entirely up to you to decide to do it or not), is to commit the test as part of the PR (I scanned the list of files, while on my phone, and didn't see it there). A good location for it (one that causes less friction with the BTV runs) could be 'test/integration/plugins'.\n\nCheers\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/216987677/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/217010122","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1054#issuecomment-217010122","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1054","id":217010122,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNzAxMDEyMg==","user":{"login":"wido","id":326786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/326786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido","html_url":"https://github.com/wido","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-04T21:32:13Z","updated_at":"2016-05-04T21:32:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Done @rhtyd !\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/217010122/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/217011034","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1533#issuecomment-217011034","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1533","id":217011034,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNzAxMTAzNA==","user":{"login":"wido","id":326786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/326786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido","html_url":"https://github.com/wido","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-04T21:35:42Z","updated_at":"2016-05-04T21:35:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for this!

Ubuntu 16.04 has issues with strongswan NetworkManager integration so I could not test using that. I would expect the VPN replacement to allow users to use all of these clients/OSs in both NAT-ed, double NAT-ed and non NAT-ed cases. Our test cases should cover VPN access usage from clients on: Windows 10/8/7, OSX and Linux (NetworkManager with l2tp or strongswan-nm), and optionally for Android and iOS phone l2tp clients.\n- I tried to fix the NAT issues, but I could not figure the configs out\n- I could not test site to site VPN or VPN customer gateway features\n\n:-1:
