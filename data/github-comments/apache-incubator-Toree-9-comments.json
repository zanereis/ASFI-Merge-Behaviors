I and @requaos reached a consensus that we should not drop Scala 2.12 in Spark 3.x periods, as I explained before, Spark 3.x uses  Scala 2.12 in default, it rarely uses the non-default Scala version in production.\r\n   >  (from @requaos) Planning forward to support both Scala 2.12 and 2.13, with a default preference for 2.12, will be most optimal.\r\n\r\n   #199's approach totally breaks the Scala 2.12 support.\r\n\r\n2. coursier upgrading involves some breaking changes, #199 silently changed the logging behavior(no test coverage). It is also worth accomplishing in an independent PR.\r\n\r\n3. #199 contains many irrelevant changes, e.g. it upgraded Java 8 to 11, and it's hard to thoroughly review with so many lines of change.\r\n\r\nAs @requaos said, I think he also agrees to break it down.\r\n\r\n> ... this is a larger effort than initially planned ...\r\n\r\n> Please let me know what I can do to prepare this PR into the singular context of Scala 2.13 support.\r\n\r\n> I can accommodate upstream changes in my fork to assist in this effort. As you see fit to divide this labor, I will gladly reduce the scope of my PR to reflect an incremental task to work more gradually towards our shared goal.\r\n\r\n@lresende That's my opinion, my goal is to accomplish the upgrading quickly, keep code quality, and make the code change history clear.

The `AddJar` seems to work with some jars but no all of them, I couldn't get what makes my jar not well loaded by the kernel. \r\n\r\nHere are the steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n- create a 2.1.21-debian11 dataproc cluster (probably the jar won't work with other env, but this is the one I am testing with)\r\n\r\n- download the jar to the local filesystem using terminal on the notebook ```gsutil cp gs://untienots_public/myproject-assembly.jar .```\r\n\r\n- load the jar in the notebook then do an import \r\n\r\nYou can check the screenshots to see the results and to see that my jar actually contains the class that couldn't be imported\r\n\r\nThe same jar is working well in dataproc jobs and spylon (another scala spark kernel), I can share the jar's code source if it can help.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1024\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-08-16 at 14 10 45\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/incubator-toree/assets/142032694/70955798-32e2-4955-bb5a-966fb1cb4aae\">\r\n<img

The restriction comes from the transitive deps of Spark, including Hive and Hadoop, see details in discussions in SPARK-44811 SPARK-36676.
