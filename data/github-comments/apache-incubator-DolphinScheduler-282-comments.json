I have two way out of my mind\r\n> \r\n> 1. we are already have https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/blob/bf5f7a88c5a7ef1c7772c6b9c5830fd72dc599ec/dolphinscheduler-python/pydolphinscheduler/src/pydolphinscheduler/java_gateway.py#L30-L47\r\n>    , I think we should covert file into module(or keep file), and migrate all `gateway.entry_point.createTenant` call into this file or modules,\r\n> \r\n> ```python\r\n> def create_tenant(name, description, queue_name):\r\n>     # we may also add some parameter verify before call\r\n>     return gateway.entry_point.createTenant(name, description, queue_name)\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> and we only need to call function `create_tenant` when we need.\r\n> \r\n> 2. we have `models` module in path https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/tree/dev/dolphinscheduler-python/pydolphinscheduler/src/pydolphinscheduler/models, and the `models` in python usually mean connection to data store system, we can take for all java gateway service is Python API DAO layer, and we migrate all `gateway.entry_point` call into module `modules`(create them if not exists)\r\n\r\nI think the first plan is better.\r\nIn the first plan, the code for API calls is more concentrated.\r\nAPI calls may have multiple methods that are not easily grouped into a single module, so the second plan may not be well implemented.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1207138249/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1207139828","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/10976#issuecomment-1207139828","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/10976","id":1207139828,"node_id":"IC_kwDOClTkms5H8330","user":{"login":"EricGao888","id":34905992,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTA1OTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34905992?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EricGao888","html_url":"https://github.com/EricGao888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EricGao888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EricGao888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EricGao888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EricGao888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EricGao888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EricGao888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EricGao888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EricGao888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EricGao888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-06T03:54:28Z","updated_at":"2022-08-06T03:54:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I'm
