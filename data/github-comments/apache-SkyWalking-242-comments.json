The worst case of this change is that the executed `prepare requests` concurrently and then call `batchDAO.synchronous.` But it is also faster than before because prepare requests are executed concurrently.\r\n            2.

There will be no small fragments requesting to write to the storage, reducing the pressure of the storage and improving the write performance\r\n                2. In ES, call each `batchDAO.synchronous` takes at least 10 seconds to cause even if one piece of data is submitted, what will wait 10 seconds.

Could you explain your point?\r\n\r\n> Service A calls service B through the gateway. Service C calls service D through the gateway.\r\nIf services A, B, and D are in a group, and this group is selected in the topology, it shows this:\r\n\r\nThis is always what we expect to see, `one-level-jump` group topology never would be complete topology. \r\n\r\n___\r\nBesides all above, why you don't have an agent on Gateway? This uninstrumented setting is for a gateway not supported, but SkyWalking covers most popular gateway, even the ones we don't, I think you should add for them.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/866692320/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/866720293","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/7165#issuecomment-866720293","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/7165","id":866720293,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2NjcyMDI5Mw==","user":{"login":"heihaozi","id":2956927,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NTY5Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2956927?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/heihaozi","html_url":"https://github.com/heihaozi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heihaozi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heihaozi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heihaozi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heihaozi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heihaozi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heihaozi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heihaozi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heihaozi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heihaozi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-23T10:26:26Z","updated_at":"2021-06-23T10:26:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you for such a quick response.\r\n\r\nFor example, when `service A` is called, it is called through `gateway G`.\r\n\r\nIn the topology, only the calls of `service A` and `gateway G` are shown.\r\n\r\nHowever, which real services call `service A` through `gateway G` is very necessary from a business perspective.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/866720293/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/866740183","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/7165#issuecomment-866740183","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/7165","id":866740183,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2Njc0MDE4Mw==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-23T11:00:25Z","updated_at":"2021-06-23T11:00:25Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Yes, I know.
