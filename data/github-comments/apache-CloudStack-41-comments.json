some API request size and time comparisons for various pagesizes against a large template collection (more than 4000 templates across 30+ zones);\n\n| Page Size | API response size (KB) | Time (ms) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 20 | 15.8 | 360 |\n| 100 | 77.1 | 366 |\n| 150 | 117 | 448 |\n| 200 | 157 | 408 |\n| 250 | 199 | 440 |\n| 500 | 402 | 791 |\n\nBased on this data, on the lowest side pagesize of 100 seems alright for the time taken vs the payload size, but has more risk on a lower reduced list size (not enough to render a scroll); on the higher side pagesize of 200-250 seems alright considering roughly similar time.\n\nRefs:\n\nps=20\n![20](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/95203/9541300/6e7a97d0-4d84-11e5-804c-c7efc228ff9b.png)\n\nps=100\n![100](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/95203/9541303/71af4932-4d84-11e5-917e-4236278fc2da.png)\n\nps=150\n![150](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/95203/9541306/74924bd6-4d84-11e5-988b-5b5ccbe5e1c0.png)\n\nps=200\n![200](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/95203/9541310/7eda7672-4d84-11e5-9f68-ac775554d60d.png)\n\nps=250\n![250](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/95203/9541311/7edba98e-4d84-11e5-99a8-74f9b13039d7.png)\n\nps=500\n![500](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/95203/9541312/7ee1a910-4d84-11e5-8bbc-3088d3655301.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/135661968/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/135662629","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/714#issuecomment-135662629","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/714","id":135662629,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNTY2MjYyOQ==","user":{"login":"karuturi","id":186833,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjgzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/186833?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi","html_url":"https://github.com/karuturi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-28T07:35:52Z","updated_at":"2015-08-28T07:35:52Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I
