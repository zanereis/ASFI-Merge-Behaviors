I am interested in your thoughts :-).\r\n\r\n_Stateful parsing_\r\nIn one of our to-be-written parsers, we need to read an external file, parse the file and keep the parsed file in memory. As far as I can see, Stellar is stateless and not capable of keeping data in memory. It might be possible by using environment variables, but this approach might get messy.\r\n\r\n_Performance_\r\nA ChainParser does not need to interpret a language the way Stellar does. We found that interpreting a language was a performance bottleneck in the parsers. In fact, we implemented a lightweight template engine in one of our links, but that was breaking the throughput rate of the parsers. Therefore, we removed this mechanism.\r\n\r\n_Tests_\r\nThere is no clear way how to write end-to-end tests for parsers involving Stellar. Using the ChainParser approach, the data files (input and expected output) and parser config are kept in one place and it is easy to add new tests for a parser.\r\n\r\n_Sharing configuration_\r\nWhen parsers are created using Stellar, there is no clear way how the parser configuration files are shared.\r\n\r\n_Post processing_\r\nNote that Stellar can still be used for post-processing the parser output. Therefore, parsers can fully rely on all the Stellar functionality.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/374864919/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/374943864","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/960#issuecomment-374943864","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/960","id":374943864,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NDk0Mzg2NA==","user":{"login":"cestella","id":540359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/540359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella","html_url":"https://github.com/cestella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-21T13:52:38Z","updated_at":"2018-03-21T13:52:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"+1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/374943864/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/374973743","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/946#issuecomment-374973743","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/946","id":374973743,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NDk3Mzc0Mw==","user":{"login":"wardbekker","id":35603,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35603?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wardbekker","html_url":"https://github.com/wardbekker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wardbekker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wardbekker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wardbekker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wardbekker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wardbekker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wardbekker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wardbekker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wardbekker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wardbekker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-21T15:14:13Z","updated_at":"2018-03-21T15:14:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Shout

I compared doing Geo enrichments in the legacy Java adapter versus doing them with `GEO_GET` in Stellar.  I also compared doing enrichments with the legacy HBase Java adapter versus `ENRICHMENT_GET`.\r\n\r\nMaybe the root cause of the performance bottleneck that you experienced was something else, a tuning issue or an unexpected problem with your template engine?  There also certainly could be a performance bug somewhere in Stellar that I am not aware of, but I think it is reasonable to expect similar performance between raw Java and Stellar.   If we do have a performance issue with Stellar, then I'd like to isolate and address it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/375037767/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/375041909","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/969#issuecomment-375041909","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/969","id":375041909,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NTA0MTkwOQ==","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-21T18:06:13Z","updated_at":"2018-03-21T18:18:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> @kevin91nl  said...

I found the Index DAOs really hard to work with and grok back then.  I had to refactor them slightly to get decent unit tests for the one thing I was trying to fix.  I feel like we are running into the same problem.\r\n\r\nI apologize if this feedback is too abstract and not specific enough.  Maybe I'm way off base because I haven't spent enough time in this portion of the code.  Maybe some of this is pre-existing, but whatever the case is, I'd really like to try and avoid repeating another #832.\r\n\r\n(1) Use composition over inhertence\r\n\r\nI think trying to share code between the two implementations (ES and Solr) via inheritance with an abstract base class is going to get us in trouble.  I would do exactly the kind of refactoring you did, but instead via composition.  \r\n\r\nThe two implementations are now fairly tied at the hip.  Code is shared between the two in the base class without well-defined abstractions defining how they interact.  Changes in the base class to evolve Solr is likely to break ES or vice versa.\r\n\r\nA good example of this is in `removeAlertsFromMetaAlert` lines 128 - 131.  It seems we had to add some logic in here due to a qwerk in Solr.  We are only going to find more qwerks over time.  The abstraction is already breaking a bit here and will continue to do so.\r\n\r\n(2) These DAOs are big.\r\n\r\n I don't see that many unit tests around this; mostly integration tests.  And I think that is partly because we could break this logic down into multiple, smaller chunks to make testing it easier.  And that also makes it easier for newbies to grok.\r\n\r\nFor example, there is logic in there for calculating meta scores.  That should be broken out into its own class whose sole responsibility is to do that.  Then we can easily write unit tests around it.  Right now, that logic is all tied up in the abstract base class which prevents us from easily unit testing it.\r\n\r\nThere is other high-level logic like that, that we could easily test in unit tests, if we refactored this and broke this down into smaller chunks.\r\n* Do not add/remove alerts from/to a metaalert that is not active.\r\n* Only add alert to a meta alert, if it does not already exist\r\n* Only remove alert it it is actually in the metaalert\r\n* If making meta alert active, add the meta alert guid to every attached alert.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/375463732/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/375464842","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/971#issuecomment-375464842","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/971","id":375464842,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NTQ2NDg0Mg==","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-22T21:33:00Z","updated_at":"2018-03-22T21:33:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @ottobackwards .\r\n\r\nFeel free to send it.

I definitely appreciate you looking at this, the feedback is definitely helpful, especially since like I said, this is a first cut, that gets things implemented in a very similar manner to the current implementation.  Iterating on it is definitely worthwhile, but I think you're right, the feedback is a little too abstract to work with as-is, so let's try to work out a more concrete approach.  Here's my initial thoughts, which are also mostly too abstract, but we can try to get more detailed from here.\r\n\r\nRe (1):\r\nWe could probably do something fairly similar to what we have the other DAO's.  Specifically, break things up into SolrMetaAlertUpdateDao + ElasticsearchMetaAlertDao, SolrMetaAlertSearchDao + SolrMetaAlertSearchDao, etc. Then have the SolrMetaAlertDao just wrap the appropriate calls as needed. I think this will help make it more digestible (which is definitely a worthy cause), but I don't think it helps make the implementations more independent. I'd still expect them to be fairly large and share a lot of code in some abstraction (whether that's abstract classes or not). The reason they'd share code is that, unlike the SolrSearchDao vs ElasticsearchSearchDao is that the metaalerts are (mostly) avoiding digging into Solr and ES internals which is definitely not the case for the other DAOs.\r\n\r\nEssentially there's a tradeoff between changes in the base classes breaking one or both (but if that happens, I'd argue that our testing is incomplete and we should be adding more tests like you mention) or having them vary independently and having issues that are fixed on one side not fixed in the other (which has it's own set of testing challenges).  I'm curious what you think is a good approach to breaking things up beyond that that avoids a lot of code duplication.\r\n\r\nFor the implementation specific quirks, I completely agree, the abstraction probably isn't as well defined as it could be.  it might be possible to refactor some things to make it more well defined, but at some point we're other going to be duplicating code or patching abstraction leaks at the DAO level.  Because I don't think Solr and ES (and any other implementation we choose) are fundamentally able to be papered over in a perfect abstraction. I definitely agree it would be nice to make them less tied at the hip, the problem is that a lot of this stuff is already broken up at the abstraction points we have (particularly at Document level, rather than implementation specific level). Right now, the implementation details are obscured from the calling REST service, and its the responsibility of the MetaAlertDao to handle the implementation details.\r\n\r\nRe (2):\r\nFor the specific calculating metascores case, and probably some of the other stuff, it only seems useful to break that sort of thing into it's own class if we intend on making it pluggable.  After all, that is a function that is pretty tied into how metaalerts are laid out and I'm not really sure what the benefit of splitting individual operations out like that is (unless we potentially needed to make them available across composed DAOs).  The other thing is the actual calculation of the scores themselves are maintained by a different class.  It's only the actual management of the metaalert representation handled by the Dao.  I'm \r\n\r\nTo do more unit testing, there's definitely some easy targets in there.  I'd kept the unit tests that existed, but looking back at them, there's definitely more things and helper functions that could be better tested even without splitting things into more classes.\r\n\r\nIs it worthwhile to do the refactoring into the *MetaAlertUpdateDao and *UpdateSearchDao et al., along with adding some of the unit tests, and seeing where we are at that point?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/375498693/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/375659048","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/967#issuecomment-375659048","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/967","id":375659048,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NTY1OTA0OA==","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-23T13:07:01Z","updated_at":"2018-03-23T13:07:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The problem is somewhere in Storm's windowing functionality.

After fixing those fields and sending the request again through Swagger, I get the same 500 error above.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/376328665/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/376672082","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/968#issuecomment-376672082","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/968","id":376672082,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NjY3MjA4Mg==","user":{"login":"merrimanr","id":311928,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTkyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/311928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr","html_url":"https://github.com/merrimanr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-27T20:54:46Z","updated_at":"2018-03-27T20:54:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 by inspection.

The entire denormalization implementation is directly because of the limitations / strengths of Lucene stores. A store that implements more familiar joins would be totally different (and probably much, much simpler) than the ES and Solr impls.\r\n\r\nI agree that refactoring is extremely nice to improve testability, but I'm not sure what the benefit of making things more extensively pluggable (beyond splitting the DAO up into the Search / Update / subsets + your example of calculating metascores is good).  Are you more interested into breaking things out into more classes than that, just breaking apart functions more so they're more easily tested, some combination of both?\r\n\r\nI guess the main question is: \"Is breaking the meta alert dao into the various sub functions (Search, Update, etc.) + pulling out the calculate logic + at least a refactoring pass for testability a good first step in moving this forward?\" I want to make sure there's at least a clear next step before doing a lot of adjusting, even if the exact final state might shift a bit.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/377936370/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/377999542","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/967#issuecomment-377999542","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/967","id":377999542,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3Nzk5OTU0Mg==","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-02T18:16:49Z","updated_at":"2018-04-02T18:16:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This should go in after #977 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/377999542/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/378291513","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/970#issuecomment-378291513","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/970","id":378291513,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3ODI5MTUxMw==","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-03T15:29:09Z","updated_at":"2018-04-03T15:29:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> @justinleet Are you more interested into breaking things out into more classes than that, just breaking apart functions more so they're more easily tested, some combination of both?\r\n\r\n> @justinleet Is breaking the meta alert dao into the various sub functions (Search, Update, etc.) + pulling out the calculate logic + at least a refactoring pass for testability a good first step in moving this forward?\"\r\n\r\nYes, I like it; that works.

You've followed all the existing patterns and your contribution looks solid.  \r\n\r\nBut ultimately I am +0 on this.  I want others to speak up should they see value in this, but I'd argue that this should not be merged.  Please let me explain my reasoning.\r\n\r\n**Support Burden**\r\n\r\nIMHO, the 'surface area' to support in Metron has always been too large.  We as a community spend too much time supporting non-core functionality, which impedes our progress in delivering features targeted toward the cybersecurity use case.\r\n\r\nOne key example of this are the multiple different deployment targets that we support.  This has been a difficult and time consuming support task over the history of the project. I've done plenty of work on this myself.\r\n\r\nCoalescing Metron installation around the MPack was a major step forward for us.  This was intended to help remove some of that support burden.  With the MPack, much of that burden is shifted to Ambari.  \r\n\r\nFor example, with everything in Metron today, you can stand-up a single node in AWS and use the Mpack to install Metron.  It is not as \"push button\" simple as your contribution here, but it is \"good enough\" considering the resources we have in the community today.\r\n\r\n**Uncommon Use Case**\r\n\r\nWe should also consider that running Metron on a single node is a recipe for a horrible user experience.  It should only be run on a single node for development purposes, which is something that we already do support. I would not recommend that anyone run Metron on a single node for any other purpose.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nI'd prefer not too add to our ongoing support burden by merging this PR.  What you've done is a great contribution and I'd love to see you publicly share and support this as a separate project, outside of Apache Metron, going forward.\r\n\r\nIf others agree or disagree with my reasoning, please do feel free to share.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/378672905/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/378673954","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/943#issuecomment-378673954","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/943","id":378673954,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3ODY3Mzk1NA==","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-04T17:06:18Z","updated_at":"2018-04-04T17:06:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I was able to replicate this same problem in master running on the ubuntu14 dev environment.
