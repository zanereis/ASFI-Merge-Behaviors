And is the 0-value treated as a special value?\r\n\r\n@ErikJansenIRefact \r\nYes, `0` is a special value. Setting either limit to `0` will disable retention. That's the catch. \r\nPR #8358 introduced new behavior that prevents setting just one of the values to 0 via the Admin API. To disable the retention policy, both values have to be set to 0 when using the Admin API. \r\nThe \"setting either limit to 0 will disable retention\" behavior still applies to existing configurations (after upgrading to 2.7.0 when it's out) and also for `defaultRetentionTimeInMinutes` and `defaultRetentionSizeInMB` settings. I wonder how to get this documented?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/718046439/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/718048764","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/8397#issuecomment-718048764","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/8397","id":718048764,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxODA0ODc2NA==","user":{"login":"lhotari","id":66864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari","html_url":"https://github.com/lhotari","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-28T16:23:11Z","updated_at":"2020-10-28T16:24:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> I would suggest however that you describe the behaviour when both settings (time and size) have a value > 0.

size) have a value > 0. Are the messages now removed if one of the thresholds exceeds or only if both of them are exceeded. So are the settings a \"logical and\" or a \"logical or\"?\r\n> \r\n> And is the 0-value treated as a special value? So, if size = 10Gb and time=0 are message now removed if size > 10Gb?\r\n> And if size = 10Gb and time = 1d are messages now removed if either the size or the time is exceeded?\r\n\r\nGood question.  it's \"logical or\".
