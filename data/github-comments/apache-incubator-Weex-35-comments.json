__LINE只是为了这些方法selector名字不一致（但是有相同前缀）。这样在初始化weexsdk时，利用oc runtime拿到OC类的所有selectors，然后过滤出带这个前缀的方法们，依次调用这些方法，拿到要注册给前缀的真正接口名称。所以你加回车，也只是这些方法名的行号变了一下，并不影响weexSdk拿到真正要的方法名。只要WX_EXPORT_METHOD_SYNC(xxx)这些代码不在 **同一行** 就可以。\r\n\r\n到于方法丢失的问题，是weexsdk的多线程问题。参考这个PR进行修改，或升级到最新版本即可。https://github.com/apache/incubator-weex/pull/2394\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-weex/issues/comments/496180220/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-weex/issues/comments/496180845","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-weex/issues/2392#issuecomment-496180845","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-weex/issues/2392","id":496180845,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NjE4MDg0NQ==","user":{"login":"wqyfavor","id":113776,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzc3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/113776?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wqyfavor","html_url":"https://github.com/wqyfavor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wqyfavor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wqyfavor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wqyfavor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wqyfavor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wqyfavor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wqyfavor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wqyfavor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wqyfavor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wqyfavor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-27T11:30:32Z","updated_at":"2019-05-27T11:30:32Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"加个异常断点，看看具体抛出来的异常是什么","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-weex/issues/comments/496180845/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-weex/issues/comments/496181038","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-weex/issues/2392#issuecomment-496181038","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-weex/issues/2392","id":496181038,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NjE4MTAzOA==","user":{"login":"wqyfavor","id":113776,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzc3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/113776?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wqyfavor","html_url":"https://github.com/wqyfavor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wqyfavor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wqyfavor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wqyfavor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wqyfavor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wqyfavor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wqyfavor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wqyfavor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wqyfavor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wqyfavor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-27T11:31:16Z","updated_at":"2019-05-27T11:31:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"看你的截图我感觉是instanceId为空","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-weex/issues/comments/496181038/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-weex/issues/comments/496181292","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-weex/issues/2335#issuecomment-496181292","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-weex/issues/2335","id":496181292,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NjE4MTI5Mg==","user":{"login":"wqyfavor","id":113776,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzc3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/113776?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wqyfavor","html_url":"https://github.com/wqyfavor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wqyfavor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wqyfavor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wqyfavor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wqyfavor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wqyfavor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wqyfavor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wqyfavor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wqyfavor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wqyfavor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-27T11:32:19Z","updated_at":"2019-05-27T11:32:19Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"这个是服务端的问题，建议做代码参考，不用在意能否连上。之后我们有时间会再看一下
