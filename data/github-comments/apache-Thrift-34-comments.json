To compile Thrift with only Go support, run the following at the root of the repository:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ sh bootstrap.sh\r\n$ ./configure --prefix=/usr \\\r\n              --without-cpp \\\r\n              --without-c_glib \\\r\n\t       --without-qt4 \\\r\n              --without-qt5 \\\r\n              --without-libevent \\\r\n              --without-csharp \\\r\n              --without-haskell \\\r\n              --without-php \\\r\n              --without-ruby \\\r\n              --without-python \\\r\n              --without-erlang \\\r\n              --without-perl \\\r\n              --without-java \\\r\n              --without-c_sharp \\\r\n              --without-d \\\r\n              --without-php \\\r\n              --with-go \\\r\n              --without-lua \\\r\n              --without-nodejs \\\r\n              --without-rs\r\n$ make\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will create a `thrift` binary in `compiler/cpp/thrift`.

So, if you want to add both a `0.12.0` and a `v0.12.0` tag for this release, that works for me. In addition, if we run into issues integrating with third party sites that require minor build script-only changes, we will introduce additional SemVer compliant tags such as `v0.12.0+dub.0.1` (see [rule 10](https://semver.org/)). Just a heads up...\r\n\r\nWe typically have tried to avoid that type of tag and would go with a v0.12.1 release which is why we have had .x branches previously. not sure why this changed along the way, i think composer or one of the other build/packaging tools needed specific versioned branches","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/430628591/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/430632120","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/1611#issuecomment-430632120","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/1611","id":430632120,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMDYzMjEyMA==","user":{"login":"jeking3","id":11771245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzcxMjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11771245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3","html_url":"https://github.com/jeking3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-17T13:39:12Z","updated_at":"2018-10-17T13:40:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"We will need a `v0.12.0` tag in order to integrate with the dub (dlang) repository.  There's a good chance something will go wrong and a build metadata update will be needed.  By making an additional commit on the `0.12.0` branch and then tagging that commit `v0.12.0+dub.0.1` then it will satisfy the dub requirements for integration.  I see no need to go through a 0.12.1 release just to fix a little bit of build metadata for one language.\r\n\r\nSo again, we can have both a `0.12.0` tag to remain consistent with past tagging, and
