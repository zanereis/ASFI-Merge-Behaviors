It could be considered an `archiving` feature, and in most systems, retrieving archived data has a separate process than active data.\r\n\r\nAlso, if a user is trying to access a trace thats not available in the regular datastore, the UI can share a link to archive/permanent store, or even pull trace from there. Search will be a bit tricker, but we can handle that too by picking the correct datastore based on the TTL for the regular store.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/333226158/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/333245889","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1332#issuecomment-333245889","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1332","id":333245889,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMzI0NTg4OQ==","user":{"login":"Logic-32","id":25107222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MTA3MjIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25107222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Logic-32","html_url":"https://github.com/Logic-32","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Logic-32/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Logic-32/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Logic-32/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Logic-32/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Logic-32/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Logic-32/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Logic-32/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Logic-32/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Logic-32/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-29T21:41:45Z","updated_at":"2017-09-29T21:41:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@adriancole, it looks like I need to revive this case.

Some copy/paste the 64bit, etc. The rationale I was told from Abhishek is that the backend will reject the trace. The timestamp is used to store the data and enable even partitions in the backend. So, basically not using 32 of the 128 for the timestamp has a severe penalty if trying to use X-Ray propagation. 96 bits of random is great for probably 99.9% of deployments, and also doesn't impact sampling as most only look at lower 64-bit anyway.\r\n\r\nIf we had great support for a different way of 128-bit trace ID generation, I'd not suggest something like this, but as we don't, seems a very good reason to recommend and track one. Of course folks can make trace ID generation pluggable, but I think the tradeoff wins in favor of making things align with the largest cloud.\r\n\r\nTaking this forward, for example, I'd open a ticket on B3 with a suggested generation format for 128-bit trace IDs, with this rationale, and whoever wants to do this could originate trace IDs that Amazon won't toss. Remember, it isn't just X-Ray, it is also ALB, Api Gateway and other products that use the same ID format (if only for log correlation).\r\n\r\nThis means even if users never use X-Ray storage (which some sites can choose to as it is possible to convert zipkin data to X-Ray data), at least propagation will pass and you can ID correlate and pull data in a pinch.\r\n\r\nI think of this as tactical as it is easy to do and can be done even today. It allows us to tunnel AWS IDs through clients written for B3. Trace-Context stuff is more strategic as there's more going on there. This sort of integration shows almost exactly the pattern needed for trace-context, too.\r\n\r\nAnyone don't want me to suggest why a tracer might put timestamp in first 32 of 128? If I did, I'd mention it isn't fully random etc, and also maybe some sanity check tricks.

Will share as soon as done, but I see no road-blocks.\r\n\r\nOther notes:\r\nAmazon actually have the same sampling approach as we do. They support a \"deferred\" decision (same as absence of B3-Sampled flag). Only difference is that in this case the http response contains the result of that decision. However, I checked and this behavior isn't mandatory.\r\n\r\nSome concern raised by @jcchavezs about encoding sensitivity. Here's the response to this. Amazon's format is version stamped. If the version isn't one, we can't continue the trace anyway (until that version is understood). We have choices including adding a tag about the linked ID before the trace is restarted. Amazon have a very good api compat track record. I am in no way concerned about X-Ray trace format v1 disappearing next year. We don't know what v2 will be anyway, and who knows, it might be the `trace-context` format. Anyway TL;DR; is that in my playground, I'll verify the version, and when processing inbound headers, we can think about how to restart a trace if we are in strict AWS compat mode (implies restarting a trace if the first 32 bits could not have been epoch seconds).\r\n\r\nSo, basically there are two parts.. the easy one is just using a different algo for root IDs. The second part is for AWS interop... if a library must use AWS-compat IDs, then it needs to restart traces which don't include valid epoch seconds. The second part only impacts sites running on AWS, and can be handled by an optional tracer plugin.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/333424193/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/333425162","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1262#issuecomment-333425162","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1262","id":333425162,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMzQyNTE2Mg==","user":{"login":"yurishkuro","id":3523016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MjMwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3523016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro","html_url":"https://github.com/yurishkuro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-02T01:58:53Z","updated_at":"2017-10-02T01:58:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@adriancole

:)\n\nnit: the component relevant to out-of-band in zipkin lingo is \"reporter\".\nWe don't define the term SDK. http://zipkin.io/pages/architecture.html\n\nSo, something already recording data in a zipkin format sends directly to\nX-Ray or via a \"collector\". A collector can be any component on a transport\n(streaming or otherwise, zipkin-server or otherwise) that takes standard\nzipkin encoding and pushes it to X-Ray. I'm intentionally being abstract as\npeople have different ways they accept data.\n\nThe first (direct) technique allows folks for example who are running\nlambdas and want to pay by the trace a way to proceed without any\ninfrastructure. They just align permissions and go. For example, one can\nwrite a lambda and run it inside or outside AWS (reporting to zipkin when\noutside)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/333440589/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/333440997","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1695#issuecomment-333440997","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1695","id":333440997,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMzQ0MDk5Nw==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-02T04:57:19Z","updated_at":"2017-10-02T04:57:19Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> i don't get this. when we search against that index we still are searching for local_serviceName:annotation or local_serviceName;tag_key;tag_value.\n\nI mean to say that the serviceName can be refined independent of the\nball of tags. for example, span.local_serviceName = foo filtered\nbefore annotationQuery.

However, that even seems a bit inappropriate since I'm not in a position to \"talk about what is possible, especially what is easy to support.\"\r\n\r\nAs it stands, I'm also not sure \"backpressure\" is entirely the issue we're having.  The second instance we had an OOM, for example, was because Elasticsearch ran out of disk space.  Something obviously easy to remedy, but in that case I wouldn't expect zipkin-server to lock up and die like it did.  Instead, imo, it should try to push what data it gets and drop whatever Elasticsearch says it can't store; assuming Elasticsearch has the ability to say it can't store it.  To some extent, I'm curious why the ES_HTTP_READ_TIMEOUT property doesn't resolve this issue.  I'm guessing it's because OkHttp3 may not be able to establish the connection to Elasticsearch and therefore isn't getting to a point where it's waiting on a read?\r\n\r\nWith all that said, aside from the obvious reasons, would you still recommend updating to v2 to test this issue or do you suppose we'll still have the same problem but with a bit more buffer until we blow the heap?

We were planning on doing a pull request but v2 came out before we could get some solid tests in ;)\r\n\r\np.s. For what it's worth, we have instrumented zipkin-server with metrics we report to Graphite and our heap remains sub-1.5GB, averaging about 500MB, until ES dies.  At which point there is a rapid, borderline immediate spike to 3GB where it then churns on GC indefinitely.  The heap dumps I mentioned earlier were taken at this

We actually had to up the 10k span limit in ThriftCodec to 20k because we were semi-regularly getting 13k spans per message (rouge service we've identified and quieted down a bit).  On average I'd say we're in the 10s per message but with the number of services we have we get hundreds of thousands of spans a second (IIRC).  So, in short, the messages probably aren't that big on average but there are _a lot_ of them.\r\n\r\nI'd definitely be pro dropping early if you know the backend is down though I'm not in a position to try and implement something like that myself.  We can definitely try setting 'maxRequests=something' but, out of curiosity, where would we set that?

the different tables (bc bound by the one piece of hardware).\r\nAgain as expected reads are fast when selecting traces by their IDs, when finding trace ids by the service+span, and when selecting span names by service name.\r\nThe three SASI indexes here all perform well, roughly 5x times the latency compared to the fast (select by partition key) reads.\r\nOf the three SASI indexes reads, searching \"by_annotation\" in the traces table is the slowest, as expected as this actually uses two SASI indexes, one of which is the only SASI index that uses the `CONTAINS` mode permitting full text searching.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/335043608/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/335049651","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/1758#issuecomment-335049651","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1758","id":335049651,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNTA0OTY1MQ==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-09T00:29:01Z","updated_at":"2017-10-09T00:29:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks
