Say for example memory ? I am a beginner in python, but I assume it would have a concept of specifying the requirements, just like we can do in java (via Xmx etc.).\nFurther, for distributed resource schedulers (Yarn / mesos / kubernetes / GCE etc.), even cpu cores / disk can be specified. Although I am afraid those specifications might not be applicable for local executors. So the behavior will differ with envts (rather undesirable).\n\nOne more thing, do you have plans for UI for defining a DAG? say some sort of drag drop which allows to select from available operators

After I dug into it more, I'm not a fan of how the logs are stored on the filesystem for each worker. On top of that, each worker has to spin up a webserver to serve the logs back to the main ui process. I'm thinking of building an adapter where you can specify where the logs can be stored. It would be up to that adapter to define how to query the underlying data store to get the logs back out. Not sure if this makes sense. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/141558725/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/141561156","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/425#issuecomment-141561156","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/425","id":141561156,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MTU2MTE1Ng==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-18T20:33:00Z","updated_at":"2015-09-18T20:33:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Oh wow! that is ambitious.

Airflow can fill that space very nicely (and oh that would be such a relief), but by restricting to specific operators which take inputs more aligned with mesos.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/141630659/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/141631536","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/417#issuecomment-141631536","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/417","id":141631536,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MTYzMTUzNg==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-19T06:55:46Z","updated_at":"2015-09-19T06:55:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Clearly the best option is to add a parameter to `BaseOperator` that would be called `executor_config` or something, and the format is specified in the the executor's documentation.

you for such great product as airflow.\nI would like to speculate about \"Externally Triggered DAGs\". You've mentioned \"genome\", \"data scientist\" I'm working as bioinformatician for the last 4 years and I feel that useful, easy to install and configure workflow system is really the problem. So my speculation is about tools that bioinformatician usually run. The diversity of tools is incredible java/python/R/C++/perl based, some of them output the result into stdout some of them can put a bunch of files into current dir or relative to current subfolder. The names of output files can depend on input file/s name or be separated one. The organization of pipeline is not only the order of tools but also some logic, like, in one step we can mark some replicates on the other we can do analysis with or without replicates and based on result choose the best solution and produce output. Usually it is good to make different branches for later analysis if something wrong and repeat from specific position and downstream to save a time.\n\nSo my understanding to enable this kind of functionality and be useful airflow has to think about DAG like an instance but not each task and context has to be the same/shared for the whole DAG to pass all the data between steps. \n\nSo I just would like to have some insights about future logic for this functionality. To avoid going in wrong direction.\n\nThanks,\nAndrey\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/142098919/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/142108222","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/438#issuecomment-142108222","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/438","id":142108222,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MjEwODIyMg==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-21T21:06:20Z","updated_at":"2015-09-21T21:06:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"First thank you for doing this!

Luckily it easy to do this from the CLI and not too hard from the UI.\n\n`upstream_failed` as all other task instance states in Airflow is not a logical state, it is persistent. Marking tasks `upstream_failed` allows for the scheduler to move on an not accumulate more dependencies to check at each run. It's important to keep the scheduler's worker close to O(n) in relation to the number of tasks.\n\nThere could be more logic in this area (recursing through downstream tasks on \"mark success\", and clearing the state), but it may be more tricky than it first seems (trigger_rules, other dependencies, ...)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/142997548/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/142997598","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/458#issuecomment-142997598","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/458","id":142997598,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0Mjk5NzU5OA==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-24T17:32:09Z","updated_at":"2015-09-24T17:32:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Nice
