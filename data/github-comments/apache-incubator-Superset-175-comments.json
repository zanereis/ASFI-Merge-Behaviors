I've been re-looking into how to best configure Python applications (as opposed to packages). It seems that the recommended approach is not to pin specific versions in `setup.py` but rather in `requirements.txt` (or similar) per [here](https://caremad.io/posts/2013/07/setup-vs-requirement/) and others.\r\n\r\nIt seems in our case your `setup.py` is not prescriptive enough or contains lower bounds which aren't viable, i.e., clearly `pandas==0.18.0` is not suffice for `superset==0.26.2` and the `setup.py` should be modified to include viable versions. I believe this is the responsibility of the developer who is creating a breaking dependency change to update `setup.py` and re-generate `requirements.txt`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/430738065/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/430749163","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/6129#issuecomment-430749163","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/6129","id":430749163,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMDc0OTE2Mw==","user":{"login":"smokemonster99","id":43358107,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzU4MTA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43358107?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smokemonster99","html_url":"https://github.com/smokemonster99","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smokemonster99/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smokemonster99/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smokemonster99/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smokemonster99/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smokemonster99/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smokemonster99/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smokemonster99/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smokemonster99/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smokemonster99/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-17T19:00:19Z","updated_at":"2018-10-17T19:00:19Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"For example it would be fine if superset would use the order that filter boxes are placed on the dashboard, when it builds the WHERE clause. \r\n\r\nSo if I create 3 filter boxes, the first filters on 'account', the second filters on 'date' (Date FIlter checked) and the third filters on 'errorcode';

Some thoughts:\r\n* this seems to very much reflect the general consensus, nothing too controversial here as far as I'm concerned\r\n* guidelines or hard rules? I'm siding towards guidelines unless we can actually enforce with tooling (github or GH integrations)\r\n* I'm not sure whether not-rebasing prior to merge is a real common issue (how many times did that really happen, and how much work is it to fix a basic merge issue like import ordering?), I'd rather deal with the occasional issue with hard reverts than making everyone constantly rebase. I'm thinking code should settle quite a bit after this huge round of refactor that's been taking place (py2 deprecation, major JS restructuring, plugins, ...)\r\n* happy to give code owners a try (haven't used it in the past)\r\n* I used a stale bot in the past, but it was a bit of a manual process (running a script, used my Github personal API token ...). I really think we need this. I'm not sure if Apache will let use probot, they have strict restrictions on giving perms to outside orgs. I can dig out the info as to the thing I used in the past, but it wasn't great...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/430830011/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/430830335","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/6021#issuecomment-430830335","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/6021","id":430830335,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMDgzMDMzNQ==","user":{"login":"revathijay","id":13513068,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTEzMDY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13513068?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/revathijay","html_url":"https://github.com/revathijay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revathijay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revathijay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revathijay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revathijay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revathijay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revathijay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revathijay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revathijay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revathijay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-18T00:03:15Z","updated_at":"2018-10-18T00:03:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"We are also facing the same issue.

I'm siding towards guidelines unless we can actually enforce with tooling (github or GH integrations)\r\n\r\nGlad to hear that. We intend for this to be a written-down version of the unwritten agreement of how it currently work, with some more explicit instructions of what to do, so there will be less surprise why something is not reviewed. \r\n\r\n> * I'm not sure whether not-rebasing prior to merge is a real common issue (how many times did that really happen, and how much work is it to fix a basic merge issue like import ordering?), I'd rather deal with the occasional issue with hard reverts than making everyone constantly rebase. I'm thinking code should settle quite a bit after this huge round of refactor that's been taking place (py2 deprecation, major JS restructuring, plugins, ...)\r\n\r\nWe can extract this bullet point `[P.5.2]` into a separate issue if the community has different opinions about it. \r\n\r\n> * happy to give code owners a try (haven't used it in the past)\r\n\r\nI have never used CODEOWNERS specifically, but used OWNERS file per directory at my previous job. This can automate some manual taggings we are doing in PRs and is useful for maintaining large codebase in general. An alternative is welcome too. We choose CODEOWNERS in the proposal because it is already built-in by github.\r\n\r\n> * I used a stale bot in the past, but it was a bit of a manual process (running a script, used my Github personal API token ...). I really think we need this. I'm not sure if Apache will let use probot, they have strict restrictions on giving perms to outside orgs. I can dig out the info as to the thing I used in the past, but it wasn't great...\r\n\r\nYour experience with this will be super helpful.
