In the step of rename metadata.json(org.apache.iceberg.hadoop.HadoopTableOperations#renameToFinal), org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Client.call encounters InterruptedIOException. I suspect it comes from Flink task cancelling. On the other hand, Hdfs has renamed the metada.json file sucessfully. After rename fails, it's supposed to retry. But the thread encounters InterruptedException in sleeping(org.apache.iceberg.util.Tasks#runTaskWithRetry). Then it will throw a RuntimeException. And the version-hint will not be updated. The RuntimeException leads to rollback in org.apache.iceberg.BaseTransaction(#cleanUpOnCommitFailure), which will delete manifest list (snap-XXX).\n—\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or unsubscribe.\nYou are receiving this because you commented.Message ID: ***@***.***>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1339282266/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1339373580","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/4927#issuecomment-1339373580","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4927","id":1339373580,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85P1TgM","user":{"login":"akki","id":4801628,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MDE2Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4801628?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akki","html_url":"https://github.com/akki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akki/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-06T13:18:00Z","updated_at":"2022-12-06T13:18:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@JMin824 This ticket is about creating a table with z-order prespecified (like in the `INSERT` SQL).

We already have the value of constant columns per file available via Iceberg, so reading them from the file is unnecessary. Doing so, we avoid the read & deserialization cost for the constant columns and also avoid the memory footprint to store the column vector in memory.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1340022074/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1340027400","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/6363#issuecomment-1340027400","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/6363","id":1340027400,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85P3zII","user":{"login":"stevenzwu","id":1545663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDU2NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1545663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu","html_url":"https://github.com/stevenzwu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-06T21:25:19Z","updated_at":"2022-12-06T21:25:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"thanks @pvary for reviewing","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1340027400/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1340077268","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/6353#issuecomment-1340077268","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/6353","id":1340077268,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85P3_TU","user":{"login":"islamismailov","id":573719,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MzcxOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/573719?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/islamismailov","html_url":"https://github.com/islamismailov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/islamismailov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/islamismailov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/islamismailov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/islamismailov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/islamismailov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/islamismailov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/islamismailov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/islamismailov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/islamismailov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-06T22:11:47Z","updated_at":"2022-12-06T22:11:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@nastra  -

E.g. when reading their metadata we could convert their field IDs (starting from 1000) to the new way (starting from 10000). They would remain the same in the written metadata files but internally we could keep track of the field IDs starting from 10000. And this would only be needed if we have more than 1000 cols, so most of the tables would work as they do now.\r\n\r\nWould it make sense?

New IDs are assigned based on the last assigned partition ID in table metadata.\r\n\r\nIn v1, partition field IDs were not tracked, but were assigned sequentially starting at 1000 in the reference implementation. This assignment caused problems when reading metadata tables based on manifest files from multiple specs because partition fields with the same ID may contain different data types. For compatibility with old versions, the following rules are recommended for partition evolution in v1 tables:\r\n\r\nDo not reorder partition fields\r\nDo not drop partition fields; instead replace the field’s transform with the void transform\r\nOnly add partition fields at the end of the previous partition spec```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1341558435/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1341564011","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/6369#issuecomment-1341564011","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/6369","id":1341564011,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85P9qRr","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-07T20:37:35Z","updated_at":"2022-12-07T20:37:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'd be really careful with this change.
