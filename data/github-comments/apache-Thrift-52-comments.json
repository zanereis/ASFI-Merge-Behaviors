Looking through travis log we were using go 1.10.8 to run that test, and I do can reproduce this issue with go1.10.8 almost 100% locally.\r\n\r\nMy current understanding is that in the test we are relying on canceled context to make the http request fail: https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/e872b350ab0cfd2402340b8ca82b02dc299db69e/lib/go/thrift/http_client_test.go#L129\r\n\r\nThis works fine in go1.15.6. In go1.10.8 although it did make the `Flush` call next line fail, it doesn't really cause the write loop of the http client to stop correctly. So after you reset the `requestBuffer` inside `Flush`, the write loop of the http client still tries to read from `requestBuffer` in order to write the request, and that caused both data race and the test failure.\r\n\r\nI think the big, underlying problem is that when making the http request inside `Flush`, we passed the `requestBuffer`  to the http request (https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/e872b350ab0cfd2402340b8ca82b02dc299db69e/lib/go/thrift/http_client.go#L208). This doesn't make a copy of the buffer anywhere, so the ownership of the buffer becomes muddy: `THttpClient` thinks it owns the data and can call its `Reset`, while the http request also thinks it owns the data and it's the only one reading/writing from it.\r\n\r\nI think the proper fix would be that we need to make a copy of the buffer before sending it to http request.

If you follow the line numbers from the call stack, you'll notice that the http client actually spawned 2 goroutines for read and write (goroutine 14 is the one [for write](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/b0cb374daf646454998bac7b393f3236a2ab6aca/src/net/http/transport.go#L1238), as in it reads from the input (buffer) and writes them to the wire).\r\n\r\nSo what happened is:\r\n\r\n1. The \"main\" goroutine (the one from the test) inside http client found out that the context is already canceled, *after* it already spawned the goroutines for the read and write loops. It returns the error after the context cancellation check (and triggered the deferred `Reset`)\r\n2. In the mean time, the write loop goroutine haven't done the cancellation check yet, so it still tries to read from the buffer.\r\n\r\nIt's flaky on travis likely due to the resource limitation on the environment, that the main goroutine runs a lot slower, so when it detects context cancellation the write loop already did the check. I can almost reproduce it 100% on my local machine with go1.10.8 because I have more cores and the race condition is much more likely to happen.\r\n\r\nAfter go1.10.8 there're likely some change in stdlib http client to do the cancellation check earlier (I haven't dig into the details yet), but it doesn't mean it's safe to call `Reset` after we handed over the buffer to http client. Inside http client they have locks and stuff to guarantee that two goroutines don't try to access the buffer at the same time, but outside of that (in thrift's `THttpClient.Flush`) we are not part of that coordination. We should just give up the ownership of the buffer instead.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/746667382/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/746668599","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/2295#issuecomment-746668599","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/2295","id":746668599,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0NjY2ODU5OQ==","user":{"login":"fishy","id":78183,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MTgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/78183?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy","html_url":"https://github.com/fishy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-16T17:19:36Z","updated_at":"2020-12-16T17:19:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"cc @NIHERASE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/746668599/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/746673013","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/2295#issuecomment-746673013","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/2295","id":746673013,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0NjY3MzAxMw==","user":{"login":"dcelasun","id":144373,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDM3Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/144373?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcelasun","html_url":"https://github.com/dcelasun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcelasun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcelasun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcelasun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcelasun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcelasun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcelasun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcelasun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcelasun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcelasun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-16T17:22:16Z","updated_at":"2020-12-16T17:22:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"OK then.

The only thing you missed is that the `$buffer_size` argument is optional on the two read_binary functions. So in your stub file, provide the default value from the source which is 8192. Like this:\r\n```php\r\nfunction thrift_protocol_read_binary(object $protocol, string $obj_typename, bool $strict_read, int $buffer_size=8192): object {}\r\nfunction thrift_protocol_read_binary_after_message_begin(object $protocol, string $obj_typename, bool $strict_read, int $buffer_size=8192): object {}\r\n```\r\nAnd regenerate the arginfo.h file, of course.\r\n\r\nYou can also add `/** @generate-function-entries */` to your stub file to get it to generate the function entries and pull those out of the `.cpp` file, but it isn't necessary.\r\n\r\nAnd another optional thing. To address your initial issue of the arginfo failing with PHP 7.2 and earlier, you can macro your way around that issue using:\r\n```\r\n#ifndef ZEND_ARG_INFO_WITH_DEFAULT_VALUE\r\n#define ZEND_ARG_INFO_WITH_DEFAULT_VALUE(pass_by_ref, name, default_value) \\\r\n\tZEND_ARG_INFO(pass_by_ref, name)\r\n#endif\r\n\r\n#if PHP_VERSION_ID < 70200\r\n#undef ZEND_BEGIN_ARG_WITH_RETURN_TYPE_INFO_EX\r\n#define ZEND_BEGIN_ARG_WITH_RETURN_TYPE_INFO_EX(name, return_reference, required_num_args, class_name, allow_null) \\\r\n\tstatic const zend_internal_arg_info name[] = { \\\r\n\t\t{ (const char*)(zend_uintptr_t)(required_num_args), ( #class_name ), 0, return_reference, allow_null, 0 },\r\n#endif\r\n\r\n#ifndef ZEND_BEGIN_ARG_WITH_RETURN_OBJ_INFO_EX\r\n# define ZEND_BEGIN_ARG_WITH_RETURN_OBJ_INFO_EX(name, return_reference, required_num_args, class_name, allow_null) \\\r\n\tZEND_BEGIN_ARG_WITH_RETURN_TYPE_INFO_EX(name, return_reference, required_num_args, class_name, allow_null)\r\n#endif\r\n\r\n#ifndef ZEND_BEGIN_ARG_WITH_RETURN_TYPE_MASK_EX\r\n# define ZEND_BEGIN_ARG_WITH_RETURN_TYPE_MASK_EX(name, return_reference, num_args, type) \\\r\n\tZEND_BEGIN_ARG_INFO_EX(name, 0, return_reference, num_args)\r\n#endif\r\n\r\n#ifndef ZEND_BEGIN_ARG_WITH_RETURN_OBJ_TYPE_MASK_EX\r\n# define ZEND_BEGIN_ARG_WITH_RETURN_OBJ_TYPE_MASK_EX(name, return_reference, required_num_args, class_name, type) \\\r\n\tZEND_BEGIN_ARG_INFO_EX(name, 0, return_reference, required_num_args)\r\n#endif\r\n\r\n#ifndef ZEND_ARG_TYPE_MASK\r\n# define ZEND_ARG_TYPE_MASK(pass_by_ref, name, type_mask, default_value) \\\r\n\tZEND_ARG_TYPE_INFO(pass_by_ref, name, 0, 0)\r\n#endif\r\n\r\n#ifndef ZEND_ARG_TYPE_INFO_WITH_DEFAULT_VALUE\r\n# define ZEND_ARG_TYPE_INFO_WITH_DEFAULT_VALUE(pass_by_ref, name, type_hint, allow_null, default_value) \\\r\n\tZEND_ARG_TYPE_INFO(pass_by_ref, name, type_hint, allow_null)\r\n#endif\r\n```\r\nBut again, not required.\r\n\r\nI reworked your patch slightly.
