Rationale:\r\n\r\n- Running errorprone on guava 19 is problematic, since it flags APIs that are `@Beta` in 19 but have stabilized by 31. It's OK to use these APIs, even on 19, because they're future-proof by virtue of the `@Beta` tag being removed in a later version.\r\n- I don't see a reason to run errorprone on guava 19 at all, given that we are running it on guava 31. Before this patch, both the `errorprone` and `errorprone-guava31` actions ran on guava 31 anyway, because the default version to build was 31.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/1580328092/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/1580762708","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/3193#issuecomment-1580762708","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/3193","id":1580762708,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAUNjNM5eOIZU","user":{"login":"HanumathRao","id":5264087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNjQwODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5264087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao","html_url":"https://github.com/HanumathRao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-07T12:56:34Z","updated_at":"2023-06-07T12:56:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@libenchao  and @rubenada  thanks for the review comments.

In Calcite we haven't used Dynamic Tests so far but we do make use of [Parameterized Tests](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-parameterized-tests). The two kinds of tests are very similar so I am fine with any of them; whatever is most convenient for you.\r\n\r\nAlthough a new release may bring in some good enhancements I am not sure if it is strictly mandatory at this point. We know exactly the test files so we could hard code those here and generate a dynamic test for each.\r\n\r\n> Rather than checking that the number of failures doesn't change, it's better to check that there are no failures other than the list of 'expected failures'\r\n\r\nI will try to elaborate a bit more on the comment by Julian. I think what he had in mind can achieved with the following setup.\r\n\r\nFor each test file that we decide to run we can create a \"golden\" file under `src/test/resources/sqllogictest` with the known/expected failures. Once we run the test we create the \"actual\" file with the failures and compare \"golden\" with \"actual\"; if they differ the test fails otherwise it passes. This is very much inline with how `DiffRepository` works so you could try to take advantage of it in these tests. If `DiffRepository` is not pertinent then you could opt for a simple diff or plain string equality comparison between the files.\r\n\r\nHowever, given that we have a large number of failures it might be impractical to create 622 golden files cause we might bloat the repository with test files containing errors. Currently everything under `src/test/resources` (data, golden files, logging configs, etc.) is ~3.5MB.\r\n```\r\nfind . -wholename \"*/src/test/resources/*\" -exec du -ch {} + | grep total\r\n```\r\nIf the sqllogic golden files containing the errors are around ~10MB it would be acceptable but going much more beyond that can be problematic and we should probably rethink this. Using compression to keep the file size low should be fine I guess.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/1590951163/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/1591788720","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/3264#issuecomment-1591788720","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/3264","id":1591788720,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAUNjNM5e4MSw","user":{"login":"asolimando","id":18898964,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4ODk4OTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18898964?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asolimando","html_url":"https://github.com/asolimando","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asolimando/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asolimando/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asolimando/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asolimando/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asolimando/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asolimando/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asolimando/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asolimando/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asolimando/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-14T18:32:04Z","updated_at":"2023-06-14T18:32:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Almost

Clone the project in 2 different directories\r\n2. Disable local caching for both clones and ensure remote caching is enabled\r\n3. Execute a build in the first clone\r\n4. Execute a build in the second clone at the same commit\r\n\r\nYou will notice that most tasks that are cacheable are not executed in the 2nd build, the outputs are fetched from the remote cache. However the fmppMain tasks, though they are marked as cacheable, will re-execute and the outputs are not fetched from the remote cache.\r\n\r\nThis is because the input cache key uses the absolute paths of the codegen directory, which will be different for the 2 clones. The cache key should use the relative paths. You can read more about this below in the Gradle docs:\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_cache.html#header\r\n\"Wrongly declared task inputs can lead to cache misses especially when containing volatile data or absolute paths.\"\r\n\r\nAnd here:\r\nhttps://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_cache.html#using_annotations\r\n\"However, input files are identified by default by their absolute path. So if the cache needs to be shared between several developers or machines using different paths, that won’t work as expected. So we also need to set the [path sensitivity](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_cache_concepts.html#relocatability). In this case, the relative path of the input files can be used to identify them.\"\r\n\r\nI've also attached a couple of screenshots from build scans in the JIRA issue that show the input cache key differences:\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-5785\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day this PR impacts build performance only. The fmppMain tasks will not be executed if the outputs can be gotten from the cache - which will now correctly happen because of how the input cache key is computed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/1595940325/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
