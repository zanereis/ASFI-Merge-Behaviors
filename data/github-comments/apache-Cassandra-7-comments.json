thanks for the feedback. \r\nI move the test to `CreateTest` and rewrite using `createTable()` instead of invoking cqlsh. \r\n\r\nI also made an optional commit c81be6f that determines all the unreserved keywords and enumerate through to give the best coverage. It helps to prevent the scenario that adds a keyword but forgot to add it to either unreserved or reserved list. \r\nHowever, the commit opens up the access level to `ReservedKeywords` class. Would it be a concern? Intuitively, I think \"no\". Or if we want to keep the access level, we can move the test into `ReservedKeywordsTest` (and potentially change the test class name)?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/comments/770021253/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/comments/770144376","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/868#issuecomment-770144376","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/868","id":770144376,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MDE0NDM3Ng==","user":{"login":"yifan-c","id":52585731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNTg1NzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52585731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifan-c","html_url":"https://github.com/yifan-c","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifan-c/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifan-c/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifan-c/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifan-c/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifan-c/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifan-c/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifan-c/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifan-c/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifan-c/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-30T02:55:46Z","updated_at":"2021-01-30T02:55:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"How
