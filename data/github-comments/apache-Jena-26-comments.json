The\nproject should build without an external SIS setup, but should  fail if a\nSIS1.0 setup is present.\n\nThis would be the correct behavior.\n\nI will check this again tomorrow\n\n Marco\n\n\nOn Sun, Jan 23, 2022 at 11:54 PM Andy Seaborne ***@***.***>\nwrote:\n\n> Your diff on JENA-2213 was against the code before this is applied so I've\n> applied it now.\n>\n> Rest on the ticket. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JENA-2213\n>\n> —\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n> <https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/1169#issuecomment-1019595591>, or\n> unsubscribe\n> <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ACPL5GR2UOU6SZTROYSE2GTUXSILRANCNFSM5MKOEGPA>\n> .\n> Triage notifications on the go with GitHub Mobile for iOS\n> <https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1477376905?ct=notification-email&mt=8&pt=524675>\n> or Android\n> <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.android&referrer=utm_campaign%3Dnotification-email%26utm_medium%3Demail%26utm_source%3Dgithub>.\n>\n> You are receiving this because you commented.Message ID:\n> ***@***.***>\n>\n\n\n-- \n\n\n---\nMarco Neumann\nKONA\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1019608135/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1019803091","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/1170#issuecomment-1019803091","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/1170","id":1019803091,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec48yPXT","user":{"login":"jmkeil","id":16349846,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzQ5ODQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16349846?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmkeil","html_url":"https://github.com/jmkeil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmkeil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmkeil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmkeil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmkeil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmkeil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmkeil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmkeil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmkeil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmkeil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-24T07:41:31Z","updated_at":"2022-01-24T07:41:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Good points.

The `istanbul` library is not compatible with Vue 3 & Vite yet I think (https://github.com/istanbuljs/istanbuljs/issues/668), so that might go away as soon as we upgrade to Vue 3 (first e2e/functional tests, then after that I'll upgrade to Vue 3).\r\n\r\nMaybe we could upgrade a few more dependencies?

Therefore, I hope you will consider implementing it.\r\n\r\nThanks again, and let me know if you need anything else.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1062832219/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1062850528","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/1217#issuecomment-1062850528","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/1217","id":1062850528,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec4_Wc_g","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-09T12:02:26Z","updated_at":"2022-03-09T12:02:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Out of curiosity, what's going on here?

I think it was some legacy version of virtuoso that returned empty json for empty select results. The default severity in RowSetJSONStreaming is ERROR so such \"ErrorEvents\" will be relayed to an ErrorHandler's error method that will then typically raise an exception. With this update you can set the severity to WARNING which will log a warning or IGNORE which won't report anything.\r\n\r\nAs another example, what to do if there are multiple 'results' keys in the json? Is it an error? Issue a warning? Ignore because 'things on the Web happened' and for some special use case it is fine that the optimistic parser just continues to emit bindings?\r\n\r\nYou have to actively change properties in the context though to get this behavior.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1066143980/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1066194591","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/1204#issuecomment-1066194591","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/1204","id":1066194591,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec4_jNaf","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-13T22:25:46Z","updated_at":"2022-03-13T22:25:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Mentioned on #1225.\r\n\r\nI find it hard to jump from one area of Jena to another - \r\n\r\nCould someone please test this PR and see if it works?

For example, the missing head violation is only revealed once the whole stream is consumed. However, because processing already took place (unless getResultVars was called) so you may wish to only warn about that issue and move on. The default severity is ERROR so a message would get relayed to the single configured error handler's error() method which in turn would raise an exception.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    public static void validateCompleted(RowSetJSONStreaming rs, ErrorHandler errorHandler, ValidationSettings settings) {        // Missing head\r\n        if (rs.getKHeadCount() == 0) {\r\n            ErrorHandlers.relay(errorHandler, settings.getMissingHeadSeverity(),\r\n                new ErrorEvent(String.format(\"Mandory key '%s' not seen\", kHead)));\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n Without the relay mechanism one would either have to \r\n* specify one error handler per violation, such as `ARQ.context().copy().put(rsJsonSeverityMissingHead, someErrorHandler)`. It feels wrong placing error handlers into the context rather than severity constants.\r\n* The relay method could also be seen as something RowSetJSONStreaming specific and be moved to that class as a private member.\r\n* Drop the ValidationSettings class which removes the ability to handle severity of violations individually.  In this case there would only be one error handler with an all-or-nothing policy - accept or reject all violations because they cannot be discriminated.\r\n* Drop ValidationSettings and also drop the error handler and raise hard coded exceptions. So essentially removing the ability to configure validation.\r\n* Make the ValidationSettings and the error handler stuff private in RowSetJSONStreaming for now until there is some future consensus.\r\n* Or is the primary concern the IGNORE constant which should be removed because a violation must at least be logged but never be 'ignored'?\r\n\r\nWhat is your suggestion?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1066838670/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1067160959","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/1225#issuecomment-1067160959","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/1225","id":1067160959,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec4_m5V_","user":{"login":"Aklakan","id":839608,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzOTYwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/839608?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan","html_url":"https://github.com/Aklakan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-14T18:39:52Z","updated_at":"2022-03-14T18:45:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> `IOX.safeWrite`\r\n\r\nAs a rule of thumb: Whenever you write boilerplate, you probably just haven't found its place in Jena :)\r\n\r\n> ShutdownHooks aren't perfect - there has to be recovery code as well.
