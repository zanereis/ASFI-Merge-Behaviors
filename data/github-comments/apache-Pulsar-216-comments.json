What your describing is essentially a reader that behaves like a subscription.. Then why not just use a subscription if you want to make sure to read the data no matter what?\r\n\r\nNo. What I am describing is not a subscription. When people are using a reader, it is essentially saying: \"I don't want pulsar to manage cursors. I will be responsible for managing cursors.\". In this context, it is a reader, not a subscription. What I am trying to ensure is if there is a reader actively reading events, we should be able to make sure the continuity of the events it read. \r\n\r\n> As I already said, the Reader concept was designed in this way.\r\n\r\nStep back. I am not going to argue about what should be the correct behavior. Because both of us have our considerations behind it. What I have suggested of adding a flag is a common process of changing existing behavior. The current behavior of a reader is that readers are included in the backlog quota. This is the behavior that we have delivered to the users. If we want to change the behavior, a flag is better to be added to ensure consistent behavior as before. It is a quite common practice to apply for maintaining open source projects.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/627850600/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/627855270","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/6154#issuecomment-627855270","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/6154","id":627855270,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNzg1NTI3MA==","user":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-13T09:08:31Z","updated_at":"2020-05-13T09:08:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@tomgreenwood1 It means the disk usage is over 95% so the bookie is forced to run in readonly mode.

It doesn't matter if a ledger is in the bookkeeper or already offloaded to the tiered storage.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/628737943/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/628744610","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/6930#issuecomment-628744610","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/6930","id":628744610,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyODc0NDYxMA==","user":{"login":"KannarFr","id":7518245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MTgyNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7518245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KannarFr","html_url":"https://github.com/KannarFr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KannarFr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KannarFr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KannarFr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KannarFr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KannarFr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KannarFr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KannarFr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KannarFr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KannarFr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-14T16:26:16Z","updated_at":"2020-05-14T16:26:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@sijie \r\nOk, about the indexes definition, what do you think about the definition approach using avroschema to define indexes?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/628744610/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/628764737","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/6847#issuecomment-628764737","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/6847","id":628764737,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyODc2NDczNw==","user":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-14T17:02:09Z","updated_at":"2020-05-14T17:02:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@gfredericks sorry for the late response.\r\n\r\nI think the contract is the reader should read every message that is available in the storage. The `consumer_backlog_eviction` and `TTL` are the policies attached for quota management for topics in a namespace. These settings are how brokers manage the storage for topics that should be independent of how readers and consumers receiving messages. In other words, if a reader to read messages, people should make sure those storage quota policies don't apply to the topics.\r\n\r\nWith that being said, if people do configure those storage quota settings to the topics and a reader is reading those topics, the broker should detect that the data is cleaned up due to its storage quota policy and throw an exception to the client without silently dropping the messages.\r\n\r\nSo +1 to your last comment that we need to throw an exception to the clients.

With the bookie client metric, we could easily find the bottlenecks of pulsar. I need to use bookkeeper prometheus lib instead of the copy one, and fix the prometheus test case. Because the pulsar prometheus test case is conflict with bookkeeper prometheus output format.
