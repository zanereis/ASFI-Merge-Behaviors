Setup/Environment: \r\n\t- Windows 10 + Docker Desktop + ~ 6 GB of RAM given to Docker (can be configured in settings of the docker)\r\n2. Problem: \r\n\t- The script that is used to check whether there is enough RAM memory provided to the docker is called ```frontend-mem-nag.sh```. It is initially git-cloned to WINDOWS system and by default gets file-endings for WINDOWS system and then the script runs on LINUX system and fails.

(**version 1** - no code changes required) Workaround solution for Windows host:\r\n    ```\r\n    # all commands executed in cmd/terminal\r\n    docker system prune -a\r\n    git clone https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset --config core.autocrlf=input\r\n    <... navigate to cloned git-repo ...>\r\n    cd docker\r\n    docker-compose up\r\n    ```\r\n3. (**version 2** - code changes required) Workaround solution for Windows host:\r\n\t- Make sure no previous docker images are existing \r\n\t\t* Stop everything and run ```docker system prune -a```\r\n\t- Find the following line in the file \"Dockerfile\"\r\n\t``` COPY ./superset-frontend/package* /app/superset-frontend/```\r\n\t* Insert following commands after the line:\r\n  \t```bash\r\n\tRUN apt-get update -y \r\n\tRUN apt-get install -y apt-file\r\n\tRUN apt-file update -y \r\n\tRUN apt-get install -y dos2unix\r\n\tRUN dos2unix /frontend-mem-nag.sh\r\n\t```\r\nP.S. @tlightsky I hope it will help you.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/613455330/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/613477359","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/9519#issuecomment-613477359","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/9519","id":613477359,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxMzQ3NzM1OQ==","user":{"login":"dpgaspar","id":4025227,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjUyMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4025227?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar","html_url":"https://github.com/dpgaspar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-14T14:30:38Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T14:30:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@willbarrett, totally, added tests","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/613477359/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/613484266","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/9365#issuecomment-613484266","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/9365","id":613484266,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxMzQ4NDI2Ng==","user":{"login":"akushniarevich-gd","id":60615674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNjE1Njc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60615674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akushniarevich-gd","html_url":"https://github.com/akushniarevich-gd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akushniarevich-gd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akushniarevich-gd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akushniarevich-gd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akushniarevich-gd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akushniarevich-gd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akushniarevich-gd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akushniarevich-gd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akushniarevich-gd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akushniarevich-gd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-14T14:43:09Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T14:43:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@villebro Hey, so, do we have any known solution for this Github check issue or can it be merged without the success mark as well?

Superset does not know how much data the table/view has  and in some cases it may really affect performance if you sort over trillions of rows, in addition is re-writting the SQL based on the changes not just in sort the data frame.  \r\n\r\nBut _**this is my humble opinion**_,  I worked with users with PB of data and in many cases they really froze the BI tools when they did select * or brought too much data to the interface. Some DBs could handle a good sort of trillions, but others are not as efficient or can not handle sorting of each column. Even if you have a LIMIT a SORT in the SQL force a full data scan. \r\n\r\nI personally really like the efficiency of Superset dashboard because it works in aggregated cached values, this will force to connect to db each time. \r\n\r\nJust my 2 cents.

I also used case when for finding out the interval buckets. Steps 2 and 3 are done in the view itself. The difference between my approach and yours, is in the interval bucket labels. You created the interval buckets like 1- <30 days, 2 - 30-60 days etc. I created like 0-30, 31-60, 61-90, 91-120, 121-150, 151-180, 180+ . I think Superset is correctly ordering your labels since it starts with 1, 2 etc. In my case, it orders like 0-30, 121-150, 151-180, 180+, 31-60, 61-180 . This is the issue. I need it like in the following order itself - 0-30, 31-60, 61-90, 91-120, 121-150, 151-180, 180+ . I tried it by adding the prefix with the labels like 1 - 0-30, 2 - 31-60 etc. Its working , but as per the client, label should not have the prefix numbers. Please give your suggestions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/613843204/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
