They can be defined as properties in **cluster-env** (the legacy way)\r\n1. They can be defined in the setting part in the blueprint in a new section called **cluster_settings**. In addition, the **recovery_settings** section is also treated as cluster settings. (the proposed new way)\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you are fine with the syntax. Here is an example:\r\n```\r\n...\r\n\"settings\" : [\r\n    \"cluster_settings\": [\r\n       {\r\n           \"command_retry_enabled\": \"true\",\r\n           \"commands_to_retry\": \"INSTALL,START,STOP\",\r\n           \"command_retry_max_time_in_sec\": \"500\"\r\n       }\r\n    ]\r\n    \"deployment_settings\": [\r\n      {\"skip_failure\":\"true\"}\r\n    ],\r\n    \"repository_settings\":[\r\n       ...\r\n    ],\r\n    \"recovery_settings\":[\r\n      {\"recovery_enabled\":\"true\"}\r\n    ],\r\n    \"service_settings\":[\r\n      {\r\n        \"name\":\"SERVICE_ONE\",\r\n        \"recovery_enabled\":\"true\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"name\":\"SERVICE_TWO\",\r\n        \"recovery_enabled\":\"true\"\r\n      }\r\n    ],\r\n    \"component_settings\":[\r\n        ...\r\n    ]\r\n  ],\r\n...\r\n```\r\n \r\nThe current settings structure is overly granular for cluster settings (it defines a set of maps for each section), so there is some flexibility: cluster settings can be set both as a single map  in the set (see the example above) or a set of maps like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\n    \"cluster_settings\": [\r\n       { \"command_retry_enabled\": \"true\" },\r\n       { \"commands_to_retry\": \"INSTALL,START,STOP\" },\r\n       { \"command_retry_max_time_in_sec\": \"500\" }\r\n

[AMBARI-13129](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMBARI-13129), to resolve the property atlas.server.bind.address for Hive Atlas configurations and Atlas did not have High-Availability support
