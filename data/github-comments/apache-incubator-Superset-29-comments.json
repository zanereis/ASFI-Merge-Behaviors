And I'm really glad to see that you like the idea as well. Originally, I thought of putting macros in template files too, but then we need do a deployment and restart caravel server on every macro updates. And in my company, DevOps are responsible for all the server deployment, but they're not caravel users (data scientists/analyst are end users). I think that's pretty common, other companies might have similar setup as well. So I think having them in DB would be more friendly to end users. \n\nFor your last comment, you mentioned adding macro modules in their `caravel_config.py`. Do you mean allowing users to write Python functions (instead of jinja macros) and have them available when constructing SQL expressions? I think that's cool, but if we do this, we do need take more consideration on security, because python functions could be very powerful but also more dangerous than jinja macros.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/239877012/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/239895347","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/945#issuecomment-239895347","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/945","id":239895347,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzOTg5NTM0Nw==","user":{"login":"xrmx","id":12932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx","html_url":"https://github.com/xrmx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-15T19:01:31Z","updated_at":"2016-08-15T19:01:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rlanda take a look at druid support if you want an example on how this could be done\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/239895347/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/239895514","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/943#issuecomment-239895514","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/943","id":239895514,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzOTg5NTUxNA==","user":{"login":"xrmx","id":12932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx","html_url":"https://github.com/xrmx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-15T19:02:10Z","updated_at":"2016-08-15T19:02:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closing then, thanks @jiamo for the update\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/239895514/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/239910763","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/935#issuecomment-239910763","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/935","id":239910763,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzOTkxMDc2Mw==","user":{"login":"rhp4515","id":1493526,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTM1MjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1493526?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhp4515","html_url":"https://github.com/rhp4515","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhp4515/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhp4515/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhp4515/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhp4515/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhp4515/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhp4515/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhp4515/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhp4515/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhp4515/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-15T19:57:49Z","updated_at":"2016-08-15T19:57:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Most recent commit from the master branch.
