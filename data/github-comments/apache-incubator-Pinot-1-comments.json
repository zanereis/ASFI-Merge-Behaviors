I\nthink, there is a need to tag the new machine with the same name as the old\none. I know there is an api for this buts its probably not documented. (we\nwill provide a command to do this).\n\n#.Bringing the failed server back up\n\nIn this case, the messages will again be distributed equally among the two\nnodes. There is no need to make any additional modifications to the tag as\nin previous case.\n\nIn general, you want to use have multiple replicas to handle failures.\n\nBroker: Have more than one broker will provide you fault tolerance. The\nrequest can be forwarded to any live broker.\n\nController: Simply start multiple controllers, there is leader election\namong the controllers and only one controller will manage the cluster. If\nthe leader fails, a new leader is elected and it starts managing the\ncluster.\n\nServer: Here when you create a resource, you specify the number of replicas\nneeded for each segment. Typically we use 3 replicas in our deployment. In\ncase of failure, broker automatically detects the failures and routes the\nqueries to live servers.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nThanks,\nKishore G\n\nOn Thu, Jun 25, 2015 at 4:02 PM, Jean-François Im

It's not ever relevant that the data is replicated, because the process which is responsible for reading the data is down.\nLet's say I re-start the same failed server process again. Will the old replicated data will be available as soon as the new server process is up ? Will it continue to add new data to the old replicas, or will create new replicas and the old (pre-failure) data will be lost?\n\nThank you again. Pinot is an exciting project and I really want to understand how to use it in my case.\n\nP.S. if there's some technologies that Pinot is build on and will answer my questions I'd be happy to read about it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/116018824/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/116099369","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/13#issuecomment-116099369","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/13","id":116099369,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNjA5OTM2OQ==","user":{"login":"goverdata","id":4800455,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MDA0NTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4800455?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/goverdata","html_url":"https://github.com/goverdata","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goverdata/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goverdata/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goverdata/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goverdata/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goverdata/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goverdata/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goverdata/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goverdata/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goverdata/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-27T16:51:25Z","updated_at":"2015-06-27T16:51:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This

At the servlet layer we simply, read the string entry with key pql from the payload and pass it on to the antlr compiler.\n\nalso I think from the code you pasted above, it looks like the get API is broken, the code you pasted above needs to be something like \n\n```\n@Override\n  protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp) throws ServletException, IOException {\n    try {\n      JSONObject jsonQuery = new JSONObject();\n      jsonQuery.put(\"pql\", req.getParameter(\"bql\"));\n      resp.getOutputStream().print(handleRequest(jsonQuery));\n      resp.getOutputStream().flush();\n      resp.getOutputStream().close();\n    } catch (final Exception e) {\n      resp.getOutputStream().print(e.getMessage());\n      resp.getOutputStream().flush();\n      resp.getOutputStream().close();\n      LOGGER.error(\"Caught exception while processing GET request\", e);\n      brokerMetrics.addMeteredValue(null, BrokerMeter.UNCAUGHT_GET_EXCEPTIONS, 1);\n    }\n  }\n```\n\nfrom above you can see why jackson would be an overkill. all we are doing here is making the same method handle both post and get calls. \n\nI will push this and close the issue once i do ...\nThanks \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/119016494/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/121021217","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/26#issuecomment-121021217","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/26","id":121021217,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyMTAyMTIxNw==","user":{"login":"jfim","id":246807,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjgwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246807?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfim","html_url":"https://github.com/jfim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-13T18:50:43Z","updated_at":"2015-07-13T18:50:43Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"If there is a limited number of servers relative to ZK nodes, it could be the case that this exhausts the limit of ZK connections from a single node.

I'm not aware of any current needs for moving averages.\n\nFor Grafana, we need essentially need is a query that we can use to implement:\n\n```\nquery(table, aggregations, from, to, interval);\n```\n\nSo following your PQL example, that might be something like:\n\n```\nSELECT timebucket(timestamp, '5m') as time avg(metric) FROM table WHERE timestamp BETWEEN x AND y GROUP BY time\n```\n\nI'm not sure if `1h` time buckets are hour aligned or not.  E.g. can hour buckets be for `[1:36-2:36)`, `[2:36-3:36)`, ... or just for `[1:00-2:00)`, `[2:00-3:00)`?\n\nGrafana supports auto-refresh of time series charts in the UI.  It does this by automatically making additional queries to the datasource. E.g.:\n\n```\nSELECT ... WHERE timestamp BETWEEN fromTime AND toTime ... # Initial query \nSELECT ... WHERE timestamp BETWEEN toTime AND refreshTime1 ... # auto-refresh 1\nSELECT ... WHERE timestamp BETWEEN refreshTime1 AND refreshTime2 ... # auto-refresh 2\n...\n```\n\nAnd Grafana assumes that these queries will not overlap. I believe Grafana also makes sure the time intervals it asks for are sized and aligned in a reasonable way.  Eg. It might ask for 5m intervals for the initial query and then for 30s intervals after that.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/138988879/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/138991412","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/48#issuecomment-138991412","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/48","id":138991412,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzODk5MTQxMg==","user":{"login":"jpbetz","id":523590,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMzU5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/523590?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpbetz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpbetz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpbetz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpbetz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpbetz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpbetz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpbetz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpbetz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpbetz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpbetz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpbetz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-09T18:01:41Z","updated_at":"2015-09-09T18:01:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"If you're curious.

I couldn't find any details on how exactly those work.\n\nI'm planning to provide timeseries to Grafana in UTC (avoiding daylight savings confusion).  It looks like Grafana has at least basic support for taking UTC data and rendering graphs in the viewers locale.  But that feature does seem to have caused issues in the past (https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/143, https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/277, https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/13).  Regardless, UTC is the way to go.\n\nFor missing data,  Grafana still expects a data point for each time interval that was requsted, but the data value can be \"null\" (in JSON) in which case Grafana supports a couple options: \"connected\", \"null\", and \"null as zero\".  I believe \"connected\" means to linear interpolate between the last point before the gap to the first point after the gap (not sure what happens if the gap is at the start or end).  And I believe \"null\" just means leave the gap in the rendered UI.  The default it \"connected\".\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/139000301/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/139088990","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/49#issuecomment-139088990","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/49","id":139088990,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzOTA4ODk5MA==","user":{"login":"kishoreg","id":850791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg","html_url":"https://github.com/kishoreg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-10T01:25:07Z","updated_at":"2015-09-10T01:25:07Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"You are right.

So I suppose I\nshould be able to get both offline and realtime data from table \"flights\"\nnow. Unfortunately after created realtime table \"flights\", I can't query\ncount from \"flights\" any longer, here is what I got:\n\nresult:\n{\"traceInfo\":{},\"numDocsScanned\":0,\"aggregationResults\":[],\"timeUsedMs\":0,\"segmentStatistics\":[],\"exceptions\":[],\"totalDocs\":0}\n\nBUT, I found I can query from flights_REALTIME for realtime data and\nflights_OFFLINE for offline data. These two table names, I guess are\ncreated internally by Pinot.\n\nDon't know what's wrong, any help would be appreciated.\n\n—\nReply to this email directly or view it on
