case.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-weex/issues/comments/563930832/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-weex/issues/comments/563933151","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-weex/issues/3063#issuecomment-563933151","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-weex/issues/3063","id":563933151,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MzkzMzE1MQ==","user":{"login":"YorkShen","id":4162544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNjI1NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4162544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YorkShen","html_url":"https://github.com/YorkShen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YorkShen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YorkShen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YorkShen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YorkShen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YorkShen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YorkShen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YorkShen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YorkShen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YorkShen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-10T08:57:40Z","updated_at":"2019-12-10T08:57:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"`onActivityCreate`
