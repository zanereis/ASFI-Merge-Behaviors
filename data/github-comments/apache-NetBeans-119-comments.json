It is the base command line interface that windows supports, its successor is powershell. The idea is, you open a command prompt and run a programm. That programm issues output to STDOUT or STDERR and it will be displayed. To do this, programm and shell have to agree which encoding to use. It seems mac OS and Linux have settled on UTF-8 (at least have not seen a non UTF-8 locale on linux for a long time), not so much windows. My assumption is, that every non-broken programm will try to output data to the shell in a sane manner, so it must respect the encoding of the shell.\r\n\r\nSo does your programm output correctly when run in CMD? If not, I argue, that your program is broken, if it does, somewhere my assumptions are broken. If the former case is determined, I'm strictly against changing anything in NetBeans, that is so broad as suggested here and instead fix your programm, if it is the latter, we need to investigate more.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1173151824/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1173155420","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/4321#issuecomment-1173155420","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4321","id":1173155420,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5F7O5c","user":{"login":"duoduobingbing","id":50800372,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwODAwMzcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50800372?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/duoduobingbing","html_url":"https://github.com/duoduobingbing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duoduobingbing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duoduobingbing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duoduobingbing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duoduobingbing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duoduobingbing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duoduobingbing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duoduobingbing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duoduobingbing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duoduobingbing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-03T19:10:26Z","updated_at":"2022-07-03T19:12:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> CMD is the the command line on windows (open the start menu and enter cmd)\r\n\r\nI know what the term 'cmd' means. It was just that your statement was ambiguous.\r\n\r\n> So does your programm output correctly when run in CMD?\r\n\r\nI use Windows Terminal as a wrapper for CMD and Powershell but lets not sweat about the details. Does it output correctly? Yes. Running with Powershell 5 (the legacy powershell, instead of 7) or CMD you have to change the codepage to 65001 (UTF-8) first, but, yes then it works. (This works via `chcp 65001`)\r\n\r\nTo answer a potential question about this: No, changing the codepage does not change the output of `native.encoding` when running Java in cmd or powershell with a changed codepage.\r\n\r\nAs I have stated: Having UTF-8 output under Windows was working prior to your [PR#3836](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/3836) in Netbeans 13 and now it does not. The reason why has already been stated by me.\r\n\r\nA lot of people have changed their Netbeans to UTF-8 via `-Dfile.encoding=utf-8`. Just do a Google search for `netbeans windows utf-8`. You will see a lot of results.\r\n\r\n> somewhere my assumptions are broken\r\n\r\nThat is indeed the case. \r\n\r\nHere is the way it works on Windows: Windows defaults to a windows codepage, but that is just a default. It does not necessarily reflect the encoding of the terminal. Updating the Terminal codepage does not change the value of `native.encoding` or `sun.jnu.encoding`. This requires the Windows user to set each application to UTF-8 seperately.

Any idea on how to get my hands hs_err.log would be useful. Currently I am thinking about including it (in a test PR) as an uploaded artifact ... and get it through GH API.\r\n\r\nif you take this and put it after the test fails in a PR, you would get the full workspace. Change the artifact name, change the if into `if: always()`, done. But don't do that in a matrix please since I don't know the storage limit of apache.

But potentially a dangerous one.\r\n\r\nthis won't work since apache projects don't have access to all github actions, all official actions are supported and there is a white list for some hand picked third party actions. There are tricks how to make this work but the next barrier would be permissions, and adding personal access tokens to the project is only possible via infra as far as I know - we can't simply edit

permissions).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1174966831/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1174984623","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/4218#issuecomment-1174984623","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4218","id":1174984623,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5GCNev","user":{"login":"mbien","id":114367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien","html_url":"https://github.com/mbien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-05T12:08:55Z","updated_at":"2022-07-05T12:08:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@sdedic

If this is possible then maybe we could replace the `synchronized(Repository.class)` , such as this: https://github.com/apache/netbeans/compare/master...vieiro:netbeans:hotfix/4211\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1176581402/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1176591242","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/4231#issuecomment-1176591242","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4231","id":1176591242,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5GIVuK","user":{"login":"wumpz","id":1569337,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjkzMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1569337?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wumpz","html_url":"https://github.com/wumpz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wumpz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wumpz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wumpz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wumpz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wumpz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wumpz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wumpz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wumpz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wumpz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-06T19:23:32Z","updated_at":"2022-07-06T19:23:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Same here since Netbeans 14 maybe two times.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1176591242/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1176632455","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/4335#issuecomment-1176632455","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4335","id":1176632455,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5GIfyH","user":{"login":"Chris2011","id":795658,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NTY1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/795658?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011","html_url":"https://github.com/Chris2011","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-06T19:49:55Z","updated_at":"2022-07-06T19:51:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I dunno whether this was intended to be or a Windows specific thing but when I Minimize NetBeans to a specific size the space above the menu is somehow the same as below the menu.

The first time (possibly from a different test case), the default `Lookup` got an `NbRepository` as usual and cached it. The second time, the same `Lookup` class was used; when the new `BootClassLoader` was created, a new copy of `Repository` was loaded, and `Repository.getDefault` was called, the old `NbRepository` was found but the “real McCoy” defense detected that this was not actually assignable to the `Repository` class being queried, so it bailed out. Of course this is all not supposed to be possible, because each test run is supposed to load `Lookup` and everything else from scratch: https://github.com/apache/netbeans/blob/a1b803a832cb0c1161b4c522737452ea4d8d6737/harness/nbjunit/src/org/netbeans/junit/NbModuleSuite.java#L810-L814\r\n\r\nYou can see from the build log that `Log Session` is printed twice for `ValidateLayerConsistencyTest`, implying that `TopThreadGroup` is being run twice.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1176715702/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1176720403","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/4231#issuecomment-1176720403","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4231","id":1176720403,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5GI1QT","user":{"login":"eirikbakke","id":886243,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NjI0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/886243?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke","html_url":"https://github.com/eirikbakke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-06T20:48:19Z","updated_at":"2022-07-06T20:48:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hmm, this problem would be very good to fix.
