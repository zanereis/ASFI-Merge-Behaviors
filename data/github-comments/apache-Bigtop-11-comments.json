In addition, packaging and deploying hadoop with the combination of puppet 6.17.0 and the existing manifest also succeeded.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/comments/693023101/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/comments/695818273","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bigtop/pull/674#issuecomment-695818273","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/674","id":695818273,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5NTgxODI3Mw==","user":{"login":"sekikn","id":898388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/898388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn","html_url":"https://github.com/sekikn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-20T18:15:25Z","updated_at":"2020-09-20T18:15:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Nice catch, thanks!\r\n+1 merged into master.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/comments/695818273/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/comments/695818545","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bigtop/pull/673#issuecomment-695818545","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/673","id":695818545,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5NTgxODU0NQ==","user":{"login":"sekikn","id":898388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/898388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn","html_url":"https://github.com/sekikn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-20T18:17:44Z","updated_at":"2020-09-20T18:17:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks!

But it was a problem specific to my environment, I think)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/comments/696861388/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/comments/696875415","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bigtop/pull/674#issuecomment-696875415","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/674","id":696875415,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5Njg3NTQxNQ==","user":{"login":"evans-ye","id":2102804,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDI4MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2102804?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/evans-ye","html_url":"https://github.com/evans-ye","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evans-ye/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evans-ye/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evans-ye/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evans-ye/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evans-ye/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evans-ye/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evans-ye/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evans-ye/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evans-ye/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-22T17:44:14Z","updated_at":"2020-09-22T17:44:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"OK, I see.
