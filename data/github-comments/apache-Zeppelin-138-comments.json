I have these function running in my notebooks since 1.5 versions, I don't think you have to worry about backwards compatibility and maintenance too much (they are really simple!). I'll add screenshots later, but it's easy to imagine what they do.\r\n\r\nSay that I am in the middle of the notebook and I want to run all paragraphs before a certain point, I will run ``z.runAllBefore`` and that's it. In the same way if I need to run the rest of the notebook I will use ``z.runAllAfter``. Those functionalities are really useful if you are building a notebook with complex dynamic forms usage and they will avoid the user to click repeatedly the run button.\r\n\r\nIn Jupyter buttons and shortcuts that are doing this are already present, hence I think that sooner or later you will need those functions.\r\n\r\nTo describe quickly the other 3 functions... Say that I have one block where I setup variables and I want other paragraphs to be updated, instead of issuing:\r\n```scala\r\nval maxAge = z.input(\"maxAge\", 30) // select age and run paragraphs\r\nz.run(\"parID1\")\r\nz.run(\"parID2\")\r\nz.run(\"parD3\")\r\n```\r\nI will have\r\n```scala\r\nz.run(\"parID1\",\"parID2\",\"parID3\")\r\n```\r\nor, even more useful, to avoid repetitions\r\n```scala\r\nval arrayIDs = Array(\"parID1\",\"parID2\",\"parID3\")\r\nz.run(arrayIDs:_*)\r\n// in another paragraph\r\nz.run(arrayIDs:_*)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSimilarly the function ``z.run(int... idx)`` is doing the same thing, meanwhile ``z.runNext(int N)``, runs the following N paragraphs. Imagine I have the same groups of three blocks in sequence and every time I need to update a variable:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nvar maxAge = z.input(\"maxAge\", 30)\r\nz.runNext(3)\r\n// following 3 paragraphs are executed\r\n// ... later, in another paragraph below, $maxAge is updated\r\nmaxAge = df.where(\"balance > 2000\").max(\"age\").collect()(0)\r\nz.runNext(3) \r\n// and so on...\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnyway, most of them are meant to be more user-friendly wrappers of the ``run()`` functions, syntactic sugar. The most important are the runAllBefore/After in my opinion.

I feel so sorry for my late response. Tested this patch \\w your Helium package: zeppelin-ultimate-line-chart. Here are some thought and question(?) in my head. \r\n \r\n1. \"Save\" & \"Delete\" button on top of the setting table\r\n - It'll be better there are some feedback after clicking these buttons like \"Changes are successfully saved\" or \"Changes will be discarded\". How about small `ngtoast` or bootstrap dialog? \r\n![small_btns](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/24440153/82552bcc-148d-11e7-96ee-3dd305917d21.gif)\r\nProbably ppl can click the trash can button by mistake. Then they'll lose the setting. To prevent this, we can provide some alert for this. \r\n\r\n - I think we can hide \"Save\" & \"Delete\" button when the setting table is folded. A good example is in our interpreter setting page. As you know, users only can save/remove the setting when they click \"edit\" button. So how about activating those disket & trash btns only when the setting table is expanded? \r\n\r\n2. no-group field \r\n - What is difference between `no-group` and just letting `group` field as blank? Is there special reason for creating `no-group` field? (It's question actually :D)\r\n\r\n - `xAxis` and `yAxis` field size are different in `no-group` section.\r\n<img width=\"610\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-03-29 at 2 25 50 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/24440240/0ae00fc0-148e-11e7-999b-554af8d39f72.png\">\r\n\r\nAnd again, this is really cool! \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/289990558/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/289991840","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2199#issuecomment-289991840","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2199","id":289991840,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4OTk5MTg0MA==","user":{"login":"felixcheung","id":8969467,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5Njk0Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8969467?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung","html_url":"https://github.com/felixcheung","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-29T06:04:45Z","updated_at":"2017-03-29T06:04:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"looks good, could you please setup CI as referenced here https://zeppelin.apache.org/contribution/contributions.html#continuous-integration","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/289991840/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/289992729","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2199#issuecomment-289992729","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2199","id":289992729,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4OTk5MjcyOQ==","user":{"login":"AhyoungRyu","id":10060731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYwNzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10060731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu","html_url":"https://github.com/AhyoungRyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-29T06:10:41Z","updated_at":"2017-03-29T06:10:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @markito Thanks for your contribution and taking care of Geode interpreter. \r\n\r\n - Zeppelin build system relies on travis.

It would be nice to have some popup or feedback when conf is updated.\r\n2. Let me hide them when panel is minimized (e.g the chart panel, the parameter panel)\r\n\r\n## no-group field\r\n\r\n1.The textarea size of axis is defined by configuration called `dimension`. Single dimension only allow a single column to be placed while multi dimension axis allows multiple columns.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n   axis: {\r\n            'xAxis': { dimension: 'single', ... },\r\n            'yAxis': { dimension: 'multiple', ... },\r\n          },\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Regarding to `no-group field`, it's quite hard to say in just few lines. So let me describe more.\r\n\r\n(A) Some charts require aggregation. (= groupBy in SQL)\r\n(B) But some charts might not need aggregation. Assume that it's already grouped by SQL\r\n\r\nIn ultimate-line-chart, there are sub charts called `line`, `dashed`, `step` and `no-group`.\r\n\r\n- `line`, `dashed`,` step` use aggregation like other charts in Zeppelin. (similar to `PivotTransformation`)\r\n- But `no-group` doesn't use aggregation. (similar to `ColumnTransformation`)\r\n\r\nThat's the reason why the `no-group` sub chart doens't have `group` and `aggregation` columns. (assuming that data is already groupby-ed) \r\n\r\nAdditionally, `no-group`, `unique` and `value` are just strings just selected by chart makers. You can use other name e.g `awesome`, `uniquuuuuuuue` and so on..\r\n\r\n```json\r\n      'no-group': {\r\n          ....\r\n          axis: {\r\n            'xAxis': { dimension: 'single', ... },\r\n            'yAxis': { dimension: 'multiple', .. },\r\n          },\r\n          ....\r\n        },\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/1ambda/zeppelin-ultimate-line-chart/blob/master/index.js#L58\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/290310159/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/290311927","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2204#issuecomment-290311927","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2204","id":290311927,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MDMxMTkyNw==","user":{"login":"AhyoungRyu","id":10060731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYwNzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10060731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu","html_url":"https://github.com/AhyoungRyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-30T06:10:03Z","updated_at":"2017-03-30T06:10:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Tested and it works well now.
