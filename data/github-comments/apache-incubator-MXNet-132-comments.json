DMLC keeps their binaries for mxnet.io in https://github.com/dmlc/web-data -- if you'd like to write up a tutorial in markdown, you could put them there.

way tensorboard works is it takes in a log file printed in a specific format and then renders them.\r\nSo we don't necessarily need tf.scalar_summary and tf.session to use it. We simply need to print log in the same format and run tensorboard.\r\n\r\nHere is what I think would be a ideal solution:\r\n1. we strip a minimum set of files related to tensorboard out of tensorflow and build it with Makefile or cmake, not bazel.\r\n2. we modify mxnet's logging format so that it conforms with tensorboard.\r\n\r\nBut I haven't looked into this in-depth so this might be hard/impossible. So feel free to do anything that works for you first. We can discuss whether we want to merge it into mxnet or provide it as a separate solution afterwards.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/263149074/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/263149224","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/4002#issuecomment-263149224","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/4002","id":263149224,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MzE0OTIyNA==","user":{"login":"piiswrong","id":568948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODk0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong","html_url":"https://github.com/piiswrong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-27T21:34:24Z","updated_at":"2016-11-27T21:34:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It's the same with caffe's SoftmaxWithLoss.\r\nWe do need to improve the docs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/263149224/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/263149527","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/4001#issuecomment-263149527","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/4001","id":263149527,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MzE0OTUyNw==","user":{"login":"piiswrong","id":568948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODk0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong","html_url":"https://github.com/piiswrong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-27T21:40:05Z","updated_at":"2016-11-27T21:40:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"because by default cpu ops are not multi threaded.

Do people really share those logfiles with each other?  It also made me worry that the huge amount of I/O would limit performance -- which would be more of an issue with MXNet than TF.  So that's something else we can experiment/measure: what kind of IO bandwidth would be needed to produce these logfiles.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/263339526/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/263345482","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/4010#issuecomment-263345482","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/4010","id":263345482,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MzM0NTQ4Mg==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-28T18:03:13Z","updated_at":"2016-11-28T18:03:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"you
