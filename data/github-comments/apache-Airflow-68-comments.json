Thank you for this contribution. It works well and I will use it in production in few days!\nHowever, I notice some limitations in my basic usage and I would like to have your hints about it:\n\n• If my `schedule_interval is None` it raises an exception because it can not compare `NoneType` with `datetime`. (It comes that I unschedule my DAG in order to manually trigger it :/)\n\n• My second point is about manual trigger with a defined `schedule_interval`. It obviously does not work because it's not the \"last\". Logs : `- Checking latest only with left_window: 2016-10-24 23:00:00 right_window: 2016-10-25 00:00:00 now: 2016-10-24 22:45:41.283157` :) \n\nSo, this operator make impossible to manually trigger a DAG.

\nBackground job coordinator and executor is definitely Airflow's use case. That said, we usually expect the heavy lifting to be done by the various systems Airflow talks to, not usually the airflow workers.\n\nWhat this means is that usually, Airflow tasks are either : \n1) A sensor, which checks for a particular condition and returns True or False.\n2) An operator which does delegates some work to a system (Say for instance a database, Spark or such)\n3) A transfer operator, where we move data from one system to another, sometimes by using the local filesystem as an intermediate.\n\nAirflow does not usually have tasks output data in the Python sense, mostly because there is no easy way in a distributed system to guarantee that the next task will be executed on the same worker, so loading the output of a task in memory is not usually useful.\n\nFor small amounts of data there the [XCom system](https://airflow.incubator.apache.org/concepts.html#xcoms) , which aims at being a lightweight cross communication system between tasks.\n\nMaybe you could describe your use case a little better in a JIRA task [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW) or on the dev mailing list dev@airflow.incubator.apache.org, and we could see where to take this.\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/256438721/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/256441603","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1349#issuecomment-256441603","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1349","id":256441603,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NjQ0MTYwMw==","user":{"login":"artwr","id":1518713,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTg3MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1518713?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr","html_url":"https://github.com/artwr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-26T18:47:29Z","updated_at":"2016-10-26T18:47:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@dgies Do you still intend on working on this?

As we still are a bit inconsistent with the dag_runs, there is no real primary key connection. However the most consistent way of doing a lookup of the dag_run is by dag_id and execution_date. Therefore the change looks good.\n\nI do indeed wonder why we havent seen any side effects of using start_date until now, but that might have been because we are not using a task start_date as much (none actually). We should consider removing the functionality to set start_dates on tasks.

We leverage the Variables as config, and so\ngetting sane defaults into the DB is very helpful for us and makes\nmigration from Dev->Qa->Prod much more stable.\n\nThere were a few comments about how this is a bad idea, and a get should\nnever set a value, but as we already support defaults, giving a way to put\nthose in the DB makes our system more stable. Basically, you get to see\nwhat the default is, and edit it, instead of trying to remember them.\n\nWe currently handle this in our helper object, but it is MUCH cleaner to\nadd them. Basically, it adds an extra parameter to the Variable.Get and if\nthere is a default AND the extra param is set, the default is written to\nthe DB if the value doesn't exist. This allows us to see, when looking at\nthe Variable screen, what the supported variables are.\n\nJust makes things more readable in a real world ops environment.\n\nThanks,\nBen\n\n## \n\nBen Tallman - 503.680.5709\n\nOn Mon, Oct 31, 2016 at 10:55 AM, Sid Anand notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> @btallman https://github.com/btallman Let me know the status of this\n> PR.

The pinned versions are your declaration as a package maintainer that you've verified that your code works in a given environment. This has a nice side effect of preserving your sanity as you won't be inundated with bug reports in which you have to play inspector into every package codependency and system detail.\n> Users can always choose to ignore the pinned dependency-versions and do so at their own risk. However, as you release new versions of your library, you should update your dependency versions to take in improvements and bug fixes.\n\nI tend to agree but have read other articles that claim the opposite. I'm not sure what to do here. Python doesn't do nice with diamond dependencies with 2 different versions. I wish python did like npm does on that regard: building a tree where different libs can each use different versions of the same lib. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/257491919/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
