Also, I now understand that you are attempting to reproduce the original problem in order to make regression tests. I am interested to know where you would put these tests, so that I might contribute such tests in the future if I do something like this.\r\n\r\nTo check if the problem is occurring in a current version of Airflow, you should look from the kubernetes' perspective. I diagnose it by using airflow on kubernetes with the kubernetes executor. Then I make a DAG using the bash operator, and set the dag to run. I watch the task begin / the pod for the task being created with the command ```kubectl get pods --all-namespaces``` I can see the task come up, and kubernetes will show the pod at 1 more container than usual (in my case, two  containers - the task container and istio-proxy). The task will complete, then the container goes down. The issue is that the pod is not cleaned up because the other container, istio-proxy does not stop. That can be witnessed with another ```kubectl get pods --all-namespaces```, where you will see the task pod at 1/2 containers (because the task stopped but istio-proxy was not cleaned up)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/530091280/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/530094967","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6067#issuecomment-530094967","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6067","id":530094967,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMDA5NDk2Nw==","user":{"login":"mik-laj","id":12058428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj","html_url":"https://github.com/mik-laj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-10T19:57:40Z","updated_at":"2019-09-10T19:57:40Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@sjmiller609 \r\nGKE system test: \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/tests/gcp/operators/test_kubernetes_engine_system.py\r\nIt run the example DAG.

The signature of the callable passed to the PythonOperator is now inferred and argument values are always automatically provided. There is no need to explicitly provide or not provide the context anymore. \r\nFor more information: [python.rst]\r\n\r\nThe change is backwards compatible, setting provide_context will add the provide_context variable to the kwargs (but won't do anything).\r\n\r\nPR: #5990\r\n\r\n----\r\n# python.rst\r\n\r\nThe signature of the callable passed to the PythonOperator is inferred and argument values are always automatically provided. For example:\r\n```\r\ndef myfunc(execution_date):\r\n    print(execution_date)\r\n\r\npython_operator = PythonOperator(task_id='mytask', python_callable=myfunc, dag=dag)\r\n```\r\nNotice you don't have to set provide_context=True, variables from the task context are now automatically detected and provided.\r\n\r\nAll context variables can still be provided with a double-asterisk argument:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef myfunc(**context):\r\n    print(context)  # all variables will be provided to context\r\n\r\npython_operator = PythonOperator(task_id='mytask', python_callable=myfunc)\r\n```\r\nThe task context variable names are reserved names in the callable function, hence a clash with op_args and op_kwargs results in an exception:\r\n```\r\ndef myfunc(dag):\r\n    # raises a ValueError because \"dag\" is a reserved name\r\n    # valid signature example: myfunc(mydag)\r\n\r\npython_operator = PythonOperator(\r\n    task_id='mytask',\r\n    op_args=[1],\r\n    python_callable=myfunc,\r\n)\r\n````\r\n---\r\n\r\n# docstring\r\n```\r\nThe signature of the callable passed to the PythonOperator is inferred and argument values are always automatically provided. \r\n\r\n.. warning::\r\nThe task context variable names are reserved names in the callable function, hence a clash with op_args and op_kwargs results in an exception\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/530125171/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/530132536","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6073#issuecomment-530132536","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6073","id":530132536,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMDEzMjUzNg==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-10T21:43:41Z","updated_at":"2019-09-10T21:43:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6073?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#6073](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6073?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/commit/dd175fa8db222dad763ad35cedf85a750b52d4fb?src=pr&el=desc) will **decrease** coverage by `0.01%`.\n> The diff coverage is `93.75%`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6073/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&token=WdLKlKHOAU&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6073?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@            Coverage Diff             @@\n##           master    #6073      +/-   ##\n==========================================\n- Coverage   80.03%   80.02%   -0.02%     \n==========================================\n  Files         594      594              \n  Lines       34773    34774       +1     \n==========================================\n- Hits        27832    27828       -4     \n- Misses       6941     6946       +5\n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6073?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [airflow/gcp/hooks/dataflow.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6073/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9nY3AvaG9va3MvZGF0YWZsb3cucHk=) | `75.71% <93.75%> (+0.11%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [airflow/jobs/local\\_task\\_job.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6073/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9qb2JzL2xvY2FsX3Rhc2tfam9iLnB5) | `85% <0%> (-5%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [airflow/jobs/scheduler\\_job.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6073/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9qb2JzL3NjaGVkdWxlcl9qb2IucHk=) | `74.28% <0%> (-0.31%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [airflow/utils/dag\\_processing.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6073/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy91dGlscy9kYWdfcHJvY2Vzc2luZy5weQ==) | `58.98% <0%> (+0.18%)` | :arrow_up: |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6073?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** -
