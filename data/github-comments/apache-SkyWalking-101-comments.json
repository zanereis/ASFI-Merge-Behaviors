noticed that the http tag with SpringMVC may correct.\r\nBecause in springmvc  framework , we may know the requestmapping value.\r\nBut in tomcat ,it can only be requestUrl.\r\nThe code

So, I don't know the cause yet.\r\n\r\n\r\nYes I think the same way. \r\nThere may be \r\n**conflicts between web container interceptor(like Tomcat and Undertow) And SpringMVC Intercepeter.**\r\n\r\nBecause.\r\n**It appears randomly as below at the same time**. No obvious rule.\r\nDebug shows that two intercpters(Tomcat+MVC) both work. Both of them create EntrySpan\r\nAnd I didn't see any way that there are code that solves the **conflicts when both interceptors create Entry Span**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24379174/61285899-4f8cd800-a7f4-11e9-9894-5b87258a153f.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24379174/61285959-6b907980-a7f4-11e9-9cd7-29f3ab686bf2.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/511755571/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/511755891","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/3093#issuecomment-511755891","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/3093","id":511755891,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMTc1NTg5MQ==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-16T10:14:09Z","updated_at":"2019-07-16T10:14:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Fix CI and test first","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/511755891/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/511756279","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/3084#issuecomment-511756279","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/3084","id":511756279,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMTc1NjI3OQ==","user":{"login":"evanxuhe","id":24379174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0Mzc5MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24379174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/evanxuhe","html_url":"https://github.com/evanxuhe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evanxuhe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evanxuhe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evanxuhe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evanxuhe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evanxuhe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evanxuhe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evanxuhe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evanxuhe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evanxuhe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-16T10:15:21Z","updated_at":"2019-07-16T10:15:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> So if springMVC is entry ,we can see aggregation happens.\r\n\r\nI am confused that why this happens randomly.
