As you described in this issue, you deployed the RocketMQ broker in a 8 core cpu server, but as the log showed, there are more than 48 sendMessageThread in config, and as RocketMQ used spinlock as default, so you can try to adjust  the sendMessageThread num to 8 to prevent more thread was blocked to obtain the spinlock, and this also will decrease you cpu utility.\r\n\r\nAnd please pay more attention to your memory usage especially cache usage, please reserve relative more free memory for RocketMQ.
