I made the original set of changes, I was largely ignorant of the event_log_reader UDF. Hans' comments brings this up. After thinking about it, it seems to me that in the spirit of integrating the UPDATE STATISTICS logs with the other SQL logs, I should make them compatible with the event_log_reader as well. So, in the rework, I have done so. The rework has three changes:\r\n\r\n1. The row format is now the same as other SQL logs, so event_log_reader should be able to process them.\r\n2. The file names have been restricted so now they always begin with the ustat prefix. The function of the CQD USTAT_LOG has been modified somewhat to achieve that goal. The file name portion of that CQD will now be used as a second qualifier in the ULOG name. (The default has been changed to the empty string, so by default there is no added second qualifier.) So, for example, if I have CQD USTAT_LOG 'birdsall' in place, any ULOGs produced by me will have file name ustat.birdsall.node.pid.timestamp.log. This addresses the concern about accidentally naming a ULOG \"mon.something\"; it will no longer be possible to do this.\r\n3. I've updated the analyzeULOG.py script to deal with the new line format. It can still handle the old too; but one will have to supply the parameter --ULOGFormat old in order for it to do so.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/362758605/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/362773486","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/1422#issuecomment-362773486","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/1422","id":362773486,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2Mjc3MzQ4Ng==","user":{"login":"sandhyasun","id":12959766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTU5NzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12959766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandhyasun","html_url":"https://github.com/sandhyasun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandhyasun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandhyasun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandhyasun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandhyasun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandhyasun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandhyasun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandhyasun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandhyasun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandhyasun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-03T03:16:53Z","updated_at":"2018-02-03T03:16:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1
