BTW, evaluator.config  was not able to be deserialized by Tang in old Evaluator before I made the change.\n\nBasically those tests are to test the configuration in evaluator.config.  There are a few things covered in those tests:\n- language setting in evaluator config is correctly set. That was newly introduced. I wanted to inspect it inside the config.\n- alias, to make sure we are able to deserialize with alias. The deserialization itself uses the code modified in Tang to handle alias situation. Yes, we can have a unit testing in Tang. However here we want to make sure the alias classes created for Evaluator configuration is working. Those alias classes are defined for Evaluator not in Tang. You don’t see the classes are explicitly used in the test but they are called behind the deserialization process. They are used in class hierarchy and Configuration and the caller won’t see it. \n- I want to make sure service, context and task configuration passed over from driver are all deserializable. So that later, when we change Task, Context and service to properly use Tang, we won’t have any deserialization issue but refactor code only. \n\nFor now, if anything is broken, we can simply replace the evaluator.config to see what caused issue. Later, we should auto generate evalutor.config when we get time. \n\nActually even using hard code evaluator.config also helps us to test other portion. In many unit test code, we mock input data, that is equivalent. \n\nWe can definitely clean up some of them if they are not useful in current situation. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/182046904/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/182048750","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/833#issuecomment-182048750","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/833","id":182048750,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MjA0ODc1MA==","user":{"login":"shulmanb","id":519484,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxOTQ4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/519484?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shulmanb","html_url":"https://github.com/shulmanb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shulmanb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shulmanb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shulmanb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shulmanb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shulmanb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shulmanb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shulmanb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shulmanb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shulmanb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-09T20:33:11Z","updated_at":"2016-02-09T20:33:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@markusweimer ,  do you have additional comments?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/182048750/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/182102492","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/835#issuecomment-182102492","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/835","id":182102492,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MjEwMjQ5Mg==","user":{"login":"anupam128","id":2722772,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MjI3NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2722772?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anupam128","html_url":"https://github.com/anupam128","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anupam128/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anupam128/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anupam128/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anupam128/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anupam128/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anupam128/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anupam128/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anupam128/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anupam128/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-09T22:12:39Z","updated_at":"2016-02-09T22:12:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@tcNickolas made the changes.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/182102492/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/182132893","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/830#issuecomment-182132893","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/830","id":182132893,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MjEzMjg5Mw==","user":{"login":"afchung","id":2817619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTc2MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2817619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung","html_url":"https://github.com/afchung","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-09T23:30:03Z","updated_at":"2016-02-09T23:30:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jwang98052 I've addressed your comments, please have another look.

As per the title and description in JIRA, this PR is supposed to update the Mesos version to 0.27.0, but I'm not sure it's done correctly. On the `README.md`, `Mesos-0.27.0` is missing. Only Mesos-0.26.0 is added instead, which is irrelevant to the issue directly.\n\nCould you confirm that the issue is addressed? I might miss something as I'm quite new to Docker, but I'd like to make sure before merging :)\n\nThanks! \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/186520447/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/186529484","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/820#issuecomment-186529484","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/820","id":186529484,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4NjUyOTQ4NA==","user":{"login":"yunseong","id":1748276,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDgyNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1748276?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunseong","html_url":"https://github.com/yunseong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunseong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunseong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunseong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunseong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunseong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunseong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunseong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunseong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunseong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-20T07:00:55Z","updated_at":"2016-02-20T07:00:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"In addition, what would be the best policy to keep the release versions (in other words, discard old versions)?
