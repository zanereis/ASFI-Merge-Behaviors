@jzgithub1 ; Upon reviewing this issue, I'm not sure this (#888) should be \"fixed\" at all. The point of the issue was to address the \"fluent\" use case, to make it easier to do things like:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  builder.fetchColumns(getUserInput()).store();\r\n  // INSTEAD OF:\r\n  // if ((input = getUserInput()) != null) {\r\n  //   builder.fetchColumns(input).store();\r\n  // } else {\r\n  //   builder.store();\r\n  // }\r\n}\r\n\r\nprivate Collection<String> getUserInput() {\r\n  // some method that can return an empty collection\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, in doing so, it also permits this very very confusing behavior:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  builder.fetchColumns(Collection.emptySet()).store();\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere you are *literally* telling the API to fetch **NO** columns, and it is doing the exact opposite from what you said. This isn't good semantics.\r\n\r\nI thought of two other suggestions for how this could be changed to support the fluent case and have clear semantics:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  builder.fetchColumnsOrAll(getUserInput()).store(); // OR\r\n  builder.fetchColumns(Optional.of(getUserInput())).store();\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn these, it's a lot more clear that there's some \"special behavior\" in the case of `null` or `Optional.empty()`, instead of literally doing the opposite of what the user asked the API to do.\r\n\r\nHowever, it's not clear that either of these two suggestions are better than the `IllegalArgumentException` that was there originally. Perhaps somebody else has a good suggestion for clear API semantics *AND* that supports the fluent use case. If not, while I appreciate that you spent time on it, I'm inclined to think that it's no longer a good idea.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/454591914/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/454592654","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/900#issuecomment-454592654","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/900","id":454592654,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NDU5MjY1NA==","user":{"login":"BharatAnalyst","id":46725758,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NzI1NzU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46725758?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BharatAnalyst","html_url":"https://github.com/BharatAnalyst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BharatAnalyst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BharatAnalyst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BharatAnalyst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BharatAnalyst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BharatAnalyst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BharatAnalyst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BharatAnalyst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BharatAnalyst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BharatAnalyst/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-15T23:33:23Z","updated_at":"2019-01-15T23:33:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"viz2@myngl> getauths\r\nb0,b1,b2,b3,b4,b5,b6,b7","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/454592654/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/454593730","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/897#issuecomment-454593730","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/897","id":454593730,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NDU5MzczMA==","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-15T23:38:22Z","updated_at":"2019-01-15T23:38:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi @jzgithub1 .

agree with adding the clarification to the documentation, but there maybe more we can do with the underlying issue.  This could be handled by keeping #768 open, or creating a new feature request.  \r\n\r\nSome background - it seems this issue was triggered by recent changes in the zookeeper caching that changed client behavior and increased the time (minutes) before clients would see table changes (additions in this case.) The scenario:\r\n\r\nProcess 1 creates a table, performs a bulk import and stores created table name externally for clients.\r\n\r\nClient1..n use the external name to scan the table.\r\n\r\nThe clients were defensively coded, using exits() before starting the scan, throwing errors if exists() returned false. With the changes / additions of zookeeper caching in the client, the period while the table existed, but not \"known\" to the client in the cache increased, with the delay now possibly being minutes.\r\n\r\nThe use of exists() seemed reasonable because tables are externally managed and if the external processes where not managing tables as expected, the exists() check could detect this upfront before starting a scan. \r\n\r\nIn this case, the \"fix\" was to remove the check and instead rely on the scanner to determine if the table exists. Because the scanner / tservers handle the zookeeper caching differently than the client, (IIRC, they clear the cache and retry) the issue was mitigated.\r\n\r\nCaching is an internal implementation and clients do need to understand that these types of conditions can and will occur in a distributed system, but we may be able to reduce the period while this condition exists.\r\n\r\nClarifying the documentation helps, but we should consider adopting the scanner strategy for exists() where it will automatically checks with zookeeper on a cache miss and updates the cache entry, or clears the cache more aggressively. (Less desirable because it's exposing internals would be to to provide clients a clearCache() or clearAndCheckExists() method.) \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/458239780/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/458251691","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/914#issuecomment-458251691","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/914","id":458251691,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1ODI1MTY5MQ==","user":{"login":"joshelser","id":67863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3ODYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser","html_url":"https://github.com/joshelser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-28T18:42:46Z","updated_at":"2019-01-28T18:42:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Some background - it seems this issue was triggered by recent changes in the zookeeper caching that changed client behavior and increased the time (minutes) before clients would see table changes (additions in this case.)\r\n\r\nWoah.
