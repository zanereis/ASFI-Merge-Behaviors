The build system was enhanced to pick up a `<basename>-notice.txt` file, if it would pick up a `<basename>-license.txt` file and include the contents of that file into the final netbeans NOTICE file. I removed the javadoc license files and replaced them with a `Files` header in the main artifact license file. For `antlr` the license is not correct. ANTLR _2_ is public domain and a matching license file is already present in the `nbbuild/licenses` directory. These changes are committed as: https://github.com/matthiasblaesing/incubator-netbeans/commit/81878a431221da0f801dccca9f2bda797539dddb\r\n- The struts javadoc does not need to be rebuild everytime `build-init` is called. It was be conditionalized and moved to embedded `zipfileset`s instead of expanding the zip and rezipping them: https://github.com/matthiasblaesing/incubator-netbeans/commit/3daed9b79b2fc7810c9744af743501079a77550f\r\n\r\nIn the second commit above I also rebuild `struts-config_1_3-custom.dtd`. It is trivially derived from `struts-config_1_3.dtd`, the process is described in the document itself. This also fixed a build failure, as without `struts-config_1_3-custom.dtd` the build just does not work. The license for that file than results from the original file.\r\n\r\nThe `web-app_2_3.dtd` is not referenced and thus removed from the codebase.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/429253170/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/429281362","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/958#issuecomment-429281362","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/958","id":429281362,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyOTI4MTM2Mg==","user":{"login":"arusinha-zz","id":32263739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjYzNzM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32263739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arusinha-zz","html_url":"https://github.com/arusinha-zz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arusinha-zz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arusinha-zz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arusinha-zz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arusinha-zz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arusinha-zz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arusinha-zz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arusinha-zz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arusinha-zz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arusinha-zz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-12T10:31:08Z","updated_at":"2018-11-04T04:57:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"For below 3 files ,old files were checked in as with latest available file, schema generation is failing. \r\n  sun-resources_1_3.dtd \r\n glassfish-ejb-jar_3_1-1.dtd\r\n glassfish-resources_1_5.dtd\r\nRest files are taken from either https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/glassfish/main/appclient/gf-client-module/5.0/gf-client-module-5.0.jar or https://github.com/javaee/glassfish.git repo except the below\r\n sun-ejb-jar_3_0-1.dtd(http://www.sun.com/software/appserver/dtds/sun-ejb-jar_3_0-1.dtd)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/429281362/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/429350421","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/920#issuecomment-429350421","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/920","id":429350421,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyOTM1MDQyMQ==","user":{"login":"eirikbakke","id":886243,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NjI0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/886243?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke","html_url":"https://github.com/eirikbakke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-12T14:44:41Z","updated_at":"2018-10-12T14:44:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I agree with matthiasblaesing here: \"If you start netbeans from a shell, I like to see output from the called programm.\" But this patch reverses that?

The output can be found in: `nbbuild/build/verifylibsandlicenses.xml`. Look only for failures referencing the module you are working on.\r\n\r\nLong story short: Your `licenseinfo.xml` references a file, that is not present.\r\n\r\nThe build failure is IMHO minor - a bigger problem is, that your `licenseinfo.xml` makes invalid license claims.\r\n\r\n- You need to create one fileset per license/comment tuple and I think this is the main problem.\r\n- You imported the XSDs. Most, if not all, DTDs/XSDs Oracle/Sun created for Open Source projects are dual-licenses as GPLv2-CPE/CDDL. For the Apache Netbeans Project we elect the CDDL as the license. Yet the file declares: `<license ref=\"Apache-2.0-ASF\" />`. You need to check the individual files (they all should contain a license statement), but most probably are GPLv2-CPE/CDDL-1.1 and thus a correct entry would be `<license ref=\"CDDL-1.1\" />` for these.\r\n- you declare `<comment type=\"COMMENT_UNSUPPORTED\"/>` that is correct for the `doc/dd_api_schema.jpg` file. The comment should give a reasoning why the file can/needs to be included. For the schemas we include them because we use the schemas at runtime for XML validation and code completion. The CDDL can be included (https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-b, last paragraph). The prepared comment for that is \"CATEGORY-B\". If you read the FAQ entry the name becomes clear :-)\r\n\r\nSo please:\r\n- check the files if valid license headers/license info is present, if not please try to find a good copy (for the standard a good source is:https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.glassfish.main.appclient/gf-client-module/5.0/glassfish-jar, for W3C files please look on the W3C site)\r\n- If the file is from the W3C, the license is most probably `W3C-2` (the current version of the W3C software license). Please see `enterprise/web.core/src/org/netbeans/modules/web/taglib/resources/xml.xsd` and `enterprise/web.core/licenseinfo.xml` for a sample. I added the license header to the file and documented that inline.\r\n- The JavaEE XSDs normally have valid headers (see discussion about license above). It just needs to be checked, that it is ok.\r\n- Group the files by license and comment and add `fileset` entries for each group of file to `licenseinfo.xml`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/430415543/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/430425047","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/916#issuecomment-430425047","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/916","id":430425047,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMDQyNTA0Nw==","user":{"login":"juneau001","id":121002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/121002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juneau001","html_url":"https://github.com/juneau001","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juneau001/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juneau001/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juneau001/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juneau001/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juneau001/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juneau001/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juneau001/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juneau001/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juneau001/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-16T22:35:43Z","updated_at":"2018-10-16T22:35:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the detailed information @matthiasblaesing  I was not aware of the requirements for the licenseinfo.xml file, so this is great information!

The eager logic is covered by this PR. The other aspect is about the contract of autoload in the context of fragmented hosts:\r\n* Should a fragment (not eager/autoload) trigger the enabling of the host ( in case host is autoload) because host must be loaded before fragment and fragment is a \"default\" module which means the module system should load it? -> To avoid this fragment must be autoload or eager.\r\n* Should a fragment (autoload) be loaded by the module system if host is loaded in case no one depends on it? -> Contract of autoload is broken (or different for fragments)\r\n\r\nFor me it is not clear at the moment what is right.

The original idea (and still a requirement) was to supplement other module's code to satisfy (mostly legacy) dependencies (the `compat8` auto-injected dependencies were the first users of Fragment feature). For this, it is sufficient that autoload fragment loads only on demand. BUT since the hosting module's classloader is actually extended by fragment's contents, delayed load (after a depending module is enabled) causes entire IDE restart, as the classloader may have linked some classes in a different way not having the fragment loaded.\r\n\r\nI think it is good to idea to mark fragments `eager` to distinguish between the two cases. So let's have `autoload` fragments to load on demand with a possible IDE restart and `eager` fragments to attach early and prime the system. This also means that 'autoload' fragments may not fail silently (at least log) but `eager` failures should be treated just as other unsatisfied dependencies - this PR fixes that.\r\n\r\n`autoload` scenario should also satisfy `nbjavac` case, where the fragment is `OpenIDE-Module-Required`, so triggered by `java.source.nbjavac` module - correct, @jlahoda  ?\r\n\r\nSo my answers to your questions:\r\n1. yes, a non-eager/autoload (= manually controlled) fragment should enable its host. \r\n2. no, such fragments should be marked `eager`\r\n\r\n/cc: @jlahoda ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/432105461/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/432335890","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/948#issuecomment-432335890","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/948","id":432335890,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMjMzNTg5MA==","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-23T17:10:04Z","updated_at":"2018-10-23T17:10:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm not a groovy expert, but:\r\n- I ran the unittests and found them working\r\n- visited the some of the completion changes and they look sane\r\n- visited infrastructure changes and they also look sane\r\n\r\n=> From my POV this can be merged","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/432335890/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/432409136","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/982#issuecomment-432409136","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/982","id":432409136,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMjQwOTEzNg==","user":{"login":"junichi11","id":738383,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczODM4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/738383?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11","html_url":"https://github.com/junichi11","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-23T20:34:15Z","updated_at":"2018-10-23T20:34:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"BTW, I found the following log when I ran `ant tryme`:\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Log</summary>\r\n\r\n```\r\n[exec] INFO [org.netbeans.core.windows.persistence]: [PersistenceManager.getTopComponentForID] Problem when deserializing TopComponent for tcID:'MultiView-php#002EsouFACC1D41xt#002Ehistory#007C_1'.

Otherwise, it means that we just ignore the bug. I don't think it is good...\r\n\r\nI guess that a reporter could not provide an example code because the reporter could not find a file which has a problem.
