we experimented doing is showing a small warning sign left to spans without a parent rather than showing a big banner. That's less intrusive and much more intuitive. It also helps you understand if you're just missing a very small portion of the trace or a lot of spans.\r\n\r\nIf you're wondering why there's a blank hole in the trace and notice that the next span is missing its parent that'd explain it. It also helps when spans are rendered in weird places in the UI (usually at the bottom) since the reason there is that without a parent id it's impossible to attach them in the right place. This seems a better approach than a single banner since that one wouldn't give you enough context to understand how broken the trace is and what's actually missing.\r\n\r\n>  Just make sure you put the appropriate message in the warning\r\n\r\nIn this case the error is simply something like \"The parent for this span is missing\", which would work whatever the reason for dropping that span.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/403229738/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/403267227","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2124#issuecomment-403267227","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2124","id":403267227,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMzI2NzIyNw==","user":{"login":"JaryZhen","id":13216107,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjE2MTA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13216107?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaryZhen","html_url":"https://github.com/JaryZhen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaryZhen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaryZhen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaryZhen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaryZhen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaryZhen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaryZhen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaryZhen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaryZhen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaryZhen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-08T06:59:44Z","updated_at":"2018-07-08T06:59:44Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I have see the doc EnableZipkinServer which is Deprecated .

It would be nice if someone could take a stab at porting what's been done in camel-opentracing to camel-zipkin with brave 4. The current code in camel-zipkin is basically dead end and if anyone (regardless of employer) were to take the basics of what red hat did in camel-opentracing back to the original tracer, I suspect a lot of folks would be better off for it.

so I'm sorry the tests will \"ignore\" if elasticsearch isn't running and docker is not installed. You can see the failure here https://travis-ci.org/openzipkin/zipkin/builds/407517059\r\n\r\nFirst thing is to run the tests then you will know what works or not with this approach.
