Do we see this causing an issue with helix state management messages?\r\n\r\nIf you have millions of segments per table, this can be a problem. We already faced this issue at LinkedIn, and took a few actions:\r\n1. Increased the network speed in zookeeper.\r\n2. Moved to allocate a limited number of instances for any table (i.e. cluster the segments of a table within as few hosts as possible).\r\n3. We tried enabling helix batching with mixed results. It seemed to help, but other helix bugs took over and prevented us from moving further on that. Some of those bugs may have been fixed, so we may be able to enable batching again.\r\n\r\nI believe we need to also explore segments in cold storage that DO NOT make it into the idealstate.

In the situation where the number of indices is low the performance gain/loss differs. As I'm busy with school stuff I probably won't have time to dig deeper for now.

And the default pgp plugin is executed in the first life cycle. Without explicitly specifying the gpg/pgp plugin to the pom file, maven doesn't know whether this is the correct sequence. That's why I put the gpg plugin here right after the scala plugin.

PartitionSegmentPruner maintains a mapping from segment names to partition info. Same as partition pruning, we can have a time range pruner which keeps a mapping from segment names to time range. Pruning is done by looping through online segments, getting their partition infos and filtering against query time range, this will cost O(n)(n is # of online segments).\r\n\r\n    **Pros**: easy to implement\r\n**Cons**: long time to compute the segment pruning for tables with large number of segments\r\n\r\n2. **O(m*logn)** using some specialized data structure\r\nInstead of keeping the time range to segment mapping, we can have some specialized ordered data structure (e.g. interval search tree: a augmented balanced BST) optimized for searching intercepted ranges against query range. Pruning is done by searching all intercepted ranges from the interval search tree, and checking if  they are online. This will cost O(m*logn) (m is # of qualified segments).\r\nThere’s two implementations: \r\n   \r\n    **Implementation 1**: a concurrent augmented bst\r\n   **Implementation 2**: a read only augmented bst, a new tree will be built and atomicly swapped with the old one when there’s an external view change or a segment metadata updates \r\n\r\n   **Pros**: reduced time to prune for large number of segments\r\n**Cons**:  \r\n    * More data (1.5 - 2 * naive solution) stored on brokers because of  additional    pointers and auxiliary info for tree node\r\n    * For Implementation 1, hard to code (a research topic), and reading performance will be harmed due to locking\r\n    * For Implementation 2, when there’s an external view change or segment metadata updates, the whole tree needs to be gced.\r\n\r\nDue to performance requirements and since the pruner is read heavy (thousands qps in production, and external view change happens few times a day), the solution 2 implementation 2 is considered a better approach.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/724346637/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/724356911","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/6189#issuecomment-724356911","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/6189","id":724356911,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyNDM1NjkxMQ==","user":{"login":"noahprince22","id":4604046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MDQwNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4604046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/noahprince22","html_url":"https://github.com/noahprince22","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noahprince22/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noahprince22/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noahprince22/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noahprince22/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noahprince22/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noahprince22/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noahprince22/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noahprince22/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noahprince22/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-09T23:59:22Z","updated_at":"2020-11-09T23:59:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"The particular cases where this is necessary is when we have a large amount of data necessitating a large number of segments. In this particular situation, we want to make sure this scales.\r\n\r\nThe naive solution does not scale particularly well on time when you get to millions of segments. \r\n\r\nThe specialized data structure scales well on time, but is potentially a memory hog. The brokers like to keep _all_ of the routing tables in memory. That's going to get hungry. Can we quantify this? If there's 20 million segments across 10 tables, is it a gig of memory? 100 gigs?\r\n\r\nOn the difficulty to implement front, why not just start with a [Java Sorted Set](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/SortedSet.html) on start timestamp? Then filter on end timestamp on those results?

Keeping start time may help for your use case but it's not a generic solution. (i.e. time filter on queries can be made with no end timestamp)\r\n\r\nSimple math:\r\n\r\nLet's assume that we roughly store 100bytes for each segment ( we need to store segment name, start & end timestamps, and some other info).\r\n```\r\n100 bytes /segment * 20 million segments =  ~2GB\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt indeed requires GBs of memory; however, having 20millions of segments for Pinot cluster is a bit extreme use cases. If you set your segment size to be a reasonable size (200-300MB per segment), you won't have 20million segments. (200MB * 20 million segments = 4PB). To support this many segments, we probably need to read the metadata from disk instead of keeping everything in memory. Also, we probably will need to do a lot of other optimizations on brokers to support the cluster at this scale.\r\n\r\nIMO, we can first start with what @jtao15 suggested and see how they perform on your use case.
