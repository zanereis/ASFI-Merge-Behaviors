Consider adding an example DAG that shows how users should use it.\n- Consider using [Breeze environment](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/BREEZE.rst) for testing\nlocally, it’s a heavy docker but it ships with a working Airflow and a lot of integrations.\n- Be patient and persistent.

Our [pre-commits](\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/STATIC_CODE_CHECKS.rst#prerequisites-for-pre-commit-hooks)\nwill help you with that.\n- In case of a new feature add useful documentation (in docstrings or in `docs/` directory).\nAdding a new operator? Consider adding an example DAG that shows how users should use it.\n- Consider using [Breeze environment](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/BREEZE.rst) for testing\nlocally, it’s a heavy docker but it ships with a working Airflow and a lot of integrations.\n- Be patient and persistent.

documentation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/572400053/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/572406849","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/7110#issuecomment-572406849","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/7110","id":572406849,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MjQwNjg0OQ==","user":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-09T06:13:43Z","updated_at":"2020-01-09T06:13:43Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":">

@gerardo @dimberman @kaxil @ashb @mik-laj @nuclearpinguin \r\n\r\nI think you all might be interested with this change to see/review/understand how kind implementation evolves and how Breeze will let people to work with Kubernetes Executor in development mode. Kind seems to be really nice for both CI and local development.\r\n\r\nI have finally implemented the \"best\" approach with Kind I think. One that is much faster and seems to work really well for both - CI (much faster than previous approach with separate docker container) - it also helps with local development with kind cluster . Now I am testing all the ins/outs of it but it seems that it is really nice for local development as well (with regards to resources/time pulling images/using latest sources etc.). Together with the follow-up change of separating integration and slimming down Breeze: #7091 - it becomes really useful for local development.\r\n\r\nSome of the notable properties:\r\n\r\n- I switched to the latest kind 6.1 (it does not require separate exporting of the \".kube folder - it is done automatically) \r\n\r\n- I pass the docker socket from host to the container for \"ENABLE_KIND_CLUSTER\" build - this way I can use the same docker image that airflow-testing is run on - all the Kind containers are run in that docker image (and visible from the host via docker ps). This means a) no separate docker container is needed b) no need to pull image from apache/airflow - it's already there! I am checking if container is already created and skip creating it if so. You can also force cluster recreation by passing --recreate-kind cluster flag or stop \r\n\r\n- this also means that if I exit the Breeze/airflow-testing container - the cluster is still running there and I do not recreate the cluster when I re-enter the container. \r\n\r\n- However I still run \"rebuild_airflow_image.sh\" when entering the container. This way I am 100% sure I use latest sources (both locally and in CI). Plus I can later change the sources and run \"rebuild_airflow_image.sh\" without leaving the airflow-testing container! What's nice about it - it's rather fast as it only rebuilds latest layers. It allows to iterate semi-quickly while working on Kubernetes :). Still loading image to kind takes quite some time (6 minutes for me) so it is not perfect. I will improve it when I have prod image - it should be much faster to load rather than the CI one\r\n\r\n- last but not least - the .kube folder is mounted from the HOST (${AIRFLOW_SOURCES}/.kube) so you should be able to interact with the cluster from the host as well (You just need to update hostname to localhost). I might want to document it or maybe even automatically copy the configuration to include the configuration that will support kubectl/connecting to cluster-run webserver from the localhost directly. All ports are exposed already so it should be rather easy.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/572429694/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/572449354","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/7111#issuecomment-572449354","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/7111","id":572449354,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MjQ0OTM1NA==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-09T08:31:09Z","updated_at":"2020-01-09T09:26:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7111?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#7111](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7111?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/commit/a6676c4711aef1301bf3e7084371211f2f1af31b?src=pr&el=desc) will **decrease** coverage by `0.28%`.\n> The diff coverage is `100%`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7111/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&token=WdLKlKHOAU&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7111?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@            Coverage Diff             @@\n##           master    #7111      +/-   ##\n==========================================\n- Coverage    85.2%   84.92%   -0.29%     \n==========================================\n  Files         682      682              \n  Lines       38996    38999       +3     \n==========================================\n- Hits        33228    33121     -107     \n- Misses       5768     5878     +110\n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7111?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [airflow/utils/log/json\\_formatter.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7111/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy91dGlscy9sb2cvanNvbl9mb3JtYXR0ZXIucHk=) | `100% <100%> (ø)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [airflow/kubernetes/volume\\_mount.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7111/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9rdWJlcm5ldGVzL3ZvbHVtZV9tb3VudC5weQ==) | `44.44% <0%> (-55.56%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [airflow/kubernetes/volume.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7111/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9rdWJlcm5ldGVzL3ZvbHVtZS5weQ==) | `52.94% <0%> (-47.06%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [airflow/kubernetes/pod\\_launcher.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7111/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9rdWJlcm5ldGVzL3BvZF9sYXVuY2hlci5weQ==) | `45.25% <0%> (-46.72%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [airflow/kubernetes/refresh\\_config.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7111/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9rdWJlcm5ldGVzL3JlZnJlc2hfY29uZmlnLnB5) | `50.98% <0%> (-23.53%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [...rflow/contrib/operators/kubernetes\\_pod\\_operator.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7111/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9jb250cmliL29wZXJhdG9ycy9rdWJlcm5ldGVzX3BvZF9vcGVyYXRvci5weQ==) | `78.75% <0%> (-20%)` | :arrow_down: |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7111?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7111?src=pr&el=footer).

Our [pre-commits](\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/STATIC_CODE_CHECKS.rst#prerequisites-for-pre-commit-hooks)\nwill help you with that.\n- In case of a new feature add useful documentation (in docstrings or in `docs/` directory).\nAdding a new operator? Consider adding an example DAG that shows how users should use it.\n- Consider using [Breeze environment](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/BREEZE.rst) for testing\nlocally, it’s a heavy docker but it ships with a working Airflow and a lot of integrations.\n- Be patient and persistent. It might take some time to get a review or get the final approval from\nCommitters.\n\nApache Airflow is a community-driven project and together we are making it better 🚀.\n\nIn case of doubts contact

Kind seems to be really nice for both CI and local development.\r\n> \r\n> I have finally implemented the \"best\" approach with Kind I think. One that is much faster and seems to work really well for both - CI (much faster than previous approach with separate docker container) - it also helps with local development with kind cluster . Now I am testing all the ins/outs of it but it seems that it is really nice for local development as well (with regards to resources/time pulling images/using latest sources etc.). Together with the follow-up change of separating integration and slimming down Breeze: #7091 - it becomes really useful for local development.\r\n> \r\n> Some of the notable properties:\r\n> \r\n> * I switched to the latest kind 6.1 (it does not require separate exporting of the \".kube folder - it is done automatically)\r\n> * I pass the docker socket from host to the container for \"ENABLE_KIND_CLUSTER\" build - this way I can use the same docker image that airflow-testing is run on - all the Kind containers are run in that docker image (and visible from the host via docker ps). This means a) no separate docker container is needed b) no need to pull image from apache/airflow - it's already there! I am checking if container is already created and skip creating it if so. You can also force cluster recreation by passing --recreate-kind cluster flag or stop\r\n> * this also means that if I exit the Breeze/airflow-testing container - the cluster is still running there and I do not recreate the cluster when I re-enter the container.\r\n> * However I still run \"rebuild_airflow_image.sh\" when entering the container. This way I am 100% sure I use latest sources (both locally and in CI). Plus I can later change the sources and run \"rebuild_airflow_image.sh\" without leaving the airflow-testing container! What's nice about it - it's rather fast as it only rebuilds latest layers. It allows to iterate semi-quickly while working on Kubernetes :). Still loading image to kind takes quite some time (6 minutes for me) so it is not perfect. I will improve it when I have prod image - it should be much faster to load rather than the CI one\r\n> * last but not least - the .kube folder is mounted from the HOST (${AIRFLOW_SOURCES}/.kube) so you should be able to interact with the cluster from the host as well (You just need to update hostname to localhost). I might want to document it or maybe even automatically copy the configuration to include the configuration that will support kubectl/connecting to cluster-run webserver from the localhost directly. All ports are exposed already so it should be rather easy.\r\n\r\nNice work @potiuk\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/572730254/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/572731444","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/7118#issuecomment-572731444","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/7118","id":572731444,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MjczMTQ0NA==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-09T20:03:14Z","updated_at":"2020-01-10T21:08:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7118?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#7118](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7118?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/commit/28d8ef1eff901cce36e6c3fa53b944a1cf7fa00a?src=pr&el=desc) will **decrease** coverage by `0.21%`.\n> The diff coverage is `100%`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7118/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&token=WdLKlKHOAU&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7118?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@            Coverage Diff             @@\n##           master    #7118      +/-   ##\n==========================================\n- Coverage   85.17%   84.96%   -0.22%     \n==========================================\n  Files         683      683              \n  Lines       39155    39155              \n==========================================\n- Hits        33352    33267      -85     \n- Misses       5803     5888      +85\n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7118?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [airflow/gcp/hooks/bigquery.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7118/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9nY3AvaG9va3MvYmlncXVlcnkucHk=) | `91.4% <100%> (ø)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [airflow/kubernetes/volume\\_mount.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7118/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9rdWJlcm5ldGVzL3ZvbHVtZV9tb3VudC5weQ==) | `44.44% <0%> (-55.56%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [airflow/kubernetes/volume.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7118/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9rdWJlcm5ldGVzL3ZvbHVtZS5weQ==) | `52.94% <0%> (-47.06%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [airflow/kubernetes/pod\\_launcher.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7118/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9rdWJlcm5ldGVzL3BvZF9sYXVuY2hlci5weQ==) | `45.25% <0%> (-46.72%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [airflow/kubernetes/refresh\\_config.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7118/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9rdWJlcm5ldGVzL3JlZnJlc2hfY29uZmlnLnB5) | `50.98% <0%> (-23.53%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [...rflow/contrib/operators/kubernetes\\_pod\\_operator.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7118/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9jb250cmliL29wZXJhdG9ycy9rdWJlcm5ldGVzX3BvZF9vcGVyYXRvci5weQ==) | `78.31% <0%> (-20.49%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [airflow/hooks/postgres\\_hook.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7118/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9ob29rcy9wb3N0Z3Jlc19ob29rLnB5) | `94.36% <0%> (+1.4%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [airflow/hooks/dbapi\\_hook.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7118/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9ob29rcy9kYmFwaV9ob29rLnB5) | `91.73% <0%> (+1.65%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [airflow/utils/sqlalchemy.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7118/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy91dGlscy9zcWxhbGNoZW15LnB5) | `96.66% <0%> (+1.66%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [airflow/operators/postgres\\_operator.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7118/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9vcGVyYXRvcnMvcG9zdGdyZXNfb3BlcmF0b3IucHk=) | `100% <0%> (+100%)` | :arrow_up: |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7118?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** -
