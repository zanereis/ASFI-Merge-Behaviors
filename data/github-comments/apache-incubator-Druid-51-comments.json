@xvrl , we can divide this PR into 3 main parts:\n1. Changing of **ColumnPartSerde**'s interface. I had change ColumnPartSerde's interface to separate the Serializer and Deserializer. So we can have multiple serializers, one of it has the same behavior with old ones. And another one is the new streaming version. The Deserializer just do the same thing like old ones.\n2. Added **IndexedIntsWriter** interface and some *Writers which are responsible for writing dimension ids. You can see the hierarchy that i divided the writers to 2 main sub abstract classes: SingleValueIndexedIntsWriter and MultiValueIndexedIntsWriter. \n   Here are the classed which are doing the real things:\n   **VSizeIndexedIntsWriter** (single value, vsize encoded, not compressed)\n   **CompressedIntsIndexedWriter** (single value, not vsize encoded, compressed)\n   **CompressedVSizeIntsIndexedWriter** (single value, vsize encoded, compressed)\n   **VSizeIndexedWriter** (multi value, both offset and values are vsized, not compressed)\n   **CompressedVSizeIndexedV3Writer** (multi value, only values are vsized, compressed)\n   More details can be found here: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/druid-development/0CxhljSGeeo\n3.  **GenericColumnSerializer** and its sub-classes are for writing metrics. They are almost identical to MetricColumnSerializer you familiar with, except the GenericColumnSerializer can write to a Channel(which is allocated from smoosher when building). The sub-classes are:\n   **LongColumnSerializer** (write long metrics)\n   **FloatColumnSerializer** (write float metrics)\n   **ComplexColumnSerializer** (writer complex metrics)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/168865044/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/168866441","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/2138#issuecomment-168866441","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2138","id":168866441,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2ODg2NjQ0MQ==","user":{"login":"KurtYoung","id":955396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1NTM5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/955396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KurtYoung","html_url":"https://github.com/KurtYoung","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KurtYoung/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KurtYoung/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KurtYoung/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KurtYoung/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KurtYoung/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KurtYoung/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KurtYoung/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KurtYoung/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KurtYoung/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-05T01:45:39Z","updated_at":"2016-01-05T01:45:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@fjy All you comments had been taken care of, except i think maybe we can remove IndexMerger and some related classed in another PR.
