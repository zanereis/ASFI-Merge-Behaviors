One question we have is why do the java checkstyles seem to happen serially? Maybe this has something to do with the action events/listener model. Can we parallelize this?\n2. Another possible solution: create a checkstyle mode that checks the entire codebase once, before the build proceeds without checkstyle checks. Theory is that a one-time check would be faster than many smaller ones. Challenge with that is getting the equivalent of `find . -name \"*.java\"` relative to heron root from bazel.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/221915108/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/221919708","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/811#issuecomment-221919708","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/811","id":221919708,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMTkxOTcwOA==","user":{"login":"kramasamy","id":367684,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzY4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/367684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy","html_url":"https://github.com/kramasamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-26T16:16:14Z","updated_at":"2016-05-26T16:16:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@cybernet - moving to bazel > 0.2 will require some additional work especially the WORKSPACE.
