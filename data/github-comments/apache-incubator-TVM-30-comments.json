There are three major technical issues that I would like to see being addressed\r\n## Zero Overhead\r\nWe should design the debug runtime/ or profiler to be zero cost, this means that we should not worry about it when it is switched off. That would likely mean we would need a common implementation with two subclasses of graph runtime, and the debugger only linked when the debug is switched on.  \r\n\r\nIdeally, the debugger/profiler should not introduce changes to data structures  and keeps everything internal.\r\n\r\n## Clear Log Data Schema and Separation of Logger and UX\r\nIt is important to have a clear separation between UX and the data logging, in this case, a data schema of the log data being generated is extremely important, as we may want to switch UX and make it de-coupled from the logger itself.\r\n\r\n## Choice of UX\r\nWhen possible, is it OK to reuse the existing UX frameworks, for example, logging data into tensor board format and reuse the tensorboard's infrastructure, which seems to be better than the current one? Of course this design choice can be deferred as long as there is a clear data schema that does the de-coupling\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/399317077/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/399324135","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/1315#issuecomment-399324135","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1315","id":399324135,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5OTMyNDEzNQ==","user":{"login":"yidawang","id":4458509,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NTg1MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4458509?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yidawang","html_url":"https://github.com/yidawang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yidawang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yidawang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yidawang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yidawang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yidawang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yidawang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yidawang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yidawang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yidawang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-22T05:23:11Z","updated_at":"2018-06-22T05:23:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This sounds great! cc @mnuyens","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/399324135/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/399327298","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/1291#issuecomment-399327298","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1291","id":399327298,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5OTMyNzI5OA==","user":{"login":"liangfu","id":857821,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1NzgyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/857821?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu","html_url":"https://github.com/liangfu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-22T05:46:30Z","updated_at":"2018-06-22T05:46:30Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"In my observation, if sparse storage is designed to sit inside a Operation object, there is a need to create a sparse buffer object.

NNVM build, `tvm.contrib.GraphModule` object is created to interact with `runtime.graph.GraphRuntime`.\r\nTo enable the debug, instead of importing `from tvm.contrib import graph_runtime` user needs

Frontend script will receive `DebugGraphModule` object in case of debug. \r\n  2. `DebugGraphModule` handles bifurcation of data dumping for curses_ui/tensorboard.\r\n  3.
