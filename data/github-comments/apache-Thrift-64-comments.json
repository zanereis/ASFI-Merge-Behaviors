@emmenlau ,\r\n\r\nthanks for reviving this. :)\r\n\r\nI just rebased and force-pushed. It seems that after the rebase, I cannot execute the `bin/UnitTests` executable locally anymore (and I think I could back in February?). The output I see is:\r\n```\r\n> ./bin/UnitTests\r\nRunning 61 test cases...\r\nunknown location(0): fatal error: in \"ToStringTest/locale_de_DE_floating_point_to_string\": std::runtime_error: locale::facet::_S_create_c_locale name not valid\r\n~/src/thrift/thrift/lib/cpp/test/ToStringTest.cpp(57): last checkpoint: \"locale_de_DE_floating_point_to_string\" test entry\r\nAn error message from getaddrinfo on the console is expected:\r\nThrift: Mon Oct 23 11:03:28 2023 getaddrinfo() -> -2; Name or service not known\r\n\r\n*** 1 failure is detected in the test module \"thrift\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nLooks like a locale is requested that my system does not have? This may be because I'm working in WSL, but I'm pretty sure it is not caused by my changes, which do not touch anything around locales.\r\n\r\n**Edit**: Okay, this was easy, I just needed to generate the `de_DE.UTF-8` locale on my system. Now the UnitTests pass locally.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/1774759219/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/1791546374","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/2878#issuecomment-1791546374","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/2878","id":1791546374,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAS9U85qyNQG","user":{"login":"dependabot[bot]","id":49699333,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDk2OTkzMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/29110?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/dependabot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-02T21:14:24Z","updated_at":"2023-11-02T21:14:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks

Here is an example of how the generated code changes. I've listed them as bullet points for the major changes.\r\n\r\n## Change description\r\nThis PR makes it possible for typedefs that don't refer to a primative type to compile. This is accomplished by using a struct instead of declaring a type pointer (fixes the issue with READ methods etc. not existing).\r\n\r\n## Code changes\r\nHere is the example schema which we will be using to describe the issue. Without the change, the code does not compile.\r\n```thrift\r\nstruct ExampleRequest {\r\n    1: required string example_field\r\n}\r\n\r\nstruct ExampleResponse {\r\n    1: required string example_field\r\n}\r\n\r\ntypedef ExampleRequest TypedefExampleRequest\r\ntypedef ExampleResponse TypedefExampleResponse\r\n\r\nservice EnvironmentService {\r\n    ExampleResponse exampleMethod(1: ExampleRequest request)\r\n    TypedefExampleResponse typedefExampleMethod(1: TypedefExampleRequest request)\r\n}\r\n```\r\nEach change will have a title and will be formatted in three sections. Code Change (this PR), previous generated code and new generated code.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Use Structs instead of aliases\r\nThis was needed as you can't refer to methods on aliased types. You instead need to implement the existing struct to inherit it's methods.\r\n\r\n#### Code change\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/cc2d009a0f036209bc8f39d206e9d2b7cf19f4a1/compiler/cpp/src/thrift/generate/t_go_generator.cc#L769-L773\r\n\r\n#### Old Code\r\n```go\r\ntype TypedefExampleRequest *ExampleRequest\r\n\r\nfunc TypedefExampleRequestPtr(v TypedefExampleRequest) *TypedefExampleRequest { return &v }\r\n\r\ntype TypedefExampleResponse *ExampleResponse\r\n\r\nfunc TypedefExampleResponsePtr(v TypedefExampleResponse) *TypedefExampleResponse { return &v }\r\n```\r\n#### New Code\r\n```go\r\ntype TypedefExampleRequest struct { *ExampleRequest }\r\n\r\nfunc TypedefExampleRequestPtr(v TypedefExampleRequest) *TypedefExampleRequest { return &v }\r\n\r\ntype TypedefExampleResponse struct { *ExampleResponse }\r\n\r\nfunc TypedefExampleResponsePtr(v TypedefExampleResponse) *TypedefExampleResponse { return &v }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### For Forward TypeDefs use the original typedef name\r\nThis was needed as it wouldn't use the correct type. For example it would use `ExampleRequest`where instead the `TypeDefExampleRequest` should have been used.\r\n\r\n#### Code change\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/cc2d009a0f036209bc8f39d206e9d2b7cf19f4a1/compiler/cpp/src/thrift/generate/t_go_generator.cc#L2093-L2094\r\n\r\n#### Old Code\r\n```go\r\nfunc (p *EnvironmentServiceTypedefExampleMethodArgs)  ReadField1(ctx context.Context, iprot thrift.TProtocol) error {\r\n  p.Request = &ExampleRequest{}\r\n  if err := p.Request.Read(ctx, iprot); err != nil {\r\n    return thrift.PrependError(fmt.Sprintf(\"%T error reading struct: \", p.Request), err)\r\n  }\r\n  return nil\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### New Code\r\n```go\r\nfunc (p *EnvironmentServiceTypedefExampleMethodArgs)  ReadField1(ctx context.Context, iprot thrift.TProtocol) error {\r\n  p.Request = &TypedefExampleRequest{}\r\n  if err := p.Request.Read(ctx, iprot); err != nil {\r\n    return thrift.PrependError(fmt.Sprintf(\"%T error reading struct: \", p.Request), err)\r\n  }\r\n  return nil\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPleasse let me know if there's anything else I can clarify :) ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/1828052005/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/1828249596","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/2888#issuecomment-1828249596","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/2888","id":1828249596,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAS9U85s-N_8","user":{"login":"fishy","id":78183,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MTgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/78183?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy","html_url":"https://github.com/fishy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-27T16:57:41Z","updated_at":"2023-11-27T16:57:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks.
