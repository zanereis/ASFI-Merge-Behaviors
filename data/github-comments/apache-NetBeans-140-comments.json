I am trying to reduce the test case to a manageable size. However, as I wrote before, when the size is reduced, then the problems disappear. Because of this simple fact alone, there is a very low probability that you can reproduce the problem at your end. You don't seem to be responding to this established fact.\r\n\r\nI am certain that the operating system or any other software configurations and combinations cannot be blamed. My platform is as stable and performant as it gets. The entire Java stack is supported on it. I have uninstalled the anti-virus software to just give you an idea of my approach. I am running NetBeans with a single project and clean cache so it is super fast.\r\n\r\nYour suggestion does not make any sense because when I uninstall nb-javac then I remove the obvious culprit. Can you see how ridiculous your suggestion is? You seem to be clueless.\r\n\r\nI don't know whether the next point will even be understood and appreciated given what I have read so far.\r\n\r\nThe nb-javac exception is pathetic, a slap in the face. A NullPointerException without any context information is useless. Someone with access to the nb-javac code needs to look at this and make a debug build for me to use.\r\n\r\nConsidering all this, the time I spend on this looks like a complete waste because the responses I get from the NetBeans team seem to suggest that there is just no competent person even avaliable, just the level one support with the aim to manage the issue system and to limit the damage, to let the users do the work for them. There is no way that anybody who reads this issue record will come to a different conclusion.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, I am extremely annoyed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1336655163/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1336758619","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/4766#issuecomment-1336758619","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4766","id":1336758619,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5PrVFb","user":{"login":"mbien","id":114367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien","html_url":"https://github.com/mbien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-05T05:06:54Z","updated_at":"2022-12-05T05:06:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"first as warning:\r\nIf the tone doesn't improve I will simply close this and move on.\r\n\r\nBut since its Christmas time I am going to extend an olive branch:\r\n> Your suggestion does not make any sense because when I uninstall nb-javac then I remove the obvious culprit.\r\n\r\nIt is not the obvious culprit. nb-javac is almost identical to javac except it's bytecode level, If the problem would be indeed gone by removing nb-javac 19b33 from the equation, all we would have to do is to regenerate nb-javac from latest javac of JDK 19.

The warning/error/hint is really just for the tag img. In my little example you can see that the img tag is highlighted when a div is surrounded. So the hint shows it exactly for `line` + `columnStart` until `columnEnd`. For example if you have this example:\r\n\r\n`<div><img src=\"\" /></div>`\r\n\r\nI really don't want to have the fix inside the div which is correct on this position. So the fix should be really inside of the img tag not anywhere else.\r\n\r\nMaybe the problem here is that the hint on the sidebar has an other expectation for the user.\r\n\r\nHere are some other things:\r\n* I checked the HTML validator it also selects the img tag, I mean you have all the information from that.\r\n* I checked VS Code. They have no light bulb hardcoded on the sidebar so they just underline the img tag. The light bulb comes up when I set the cursor after `<|`.\r\n* I checked WebStorm, it treats the missing alt attribute also as warning, but they don't show the warning as a light bulb and I also can't switch this. The light bulb also appears just after I set the cursor on `<|`.\r\n\r\nSo all in all, I think how NetBeans treats and shows warnings, is not optimal but this is not what I want to fix here. I also changed from warning to suggestion on current line, but the problem here is the highlight disappears too and the \"suggestion\"  is just seen in the statusbar BUT it just appears also on the img, not on the whitespace tokens before the tag_open_symbol. Hope that explains a bit more. I will just fix also a multi line img which makes sense to have the fix there too but not for the whole line. This will be a hole new topic IMHO.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1339983996/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1340091917","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/5038#issuecomment-1340091917","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5038","id":1340091917,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5P4C4N","user":{"login":"sdedic","id":26788611,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg4NjEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26788611?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic","html_url":"https://github.com/sdedic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-06T22:26:04Z","updated_at":"2022-12-06T22:26:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> maybe its fine.

Also maybe the path required is the system path and not the user path - I definitely have java on my user path.\r\n\r\n[installer.txt](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/files/10206417/installer.txt)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1346143387/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1346257184","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/5068#issuecomment-1346257184","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5068","id":1346257184,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5QPkEg","user":{"login":"neilcsmith-net","id":3975960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3975960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net","html_url":"https://github.com/neilcsmith-net","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-12T10:45:04Z","updated_at":"2022-12-12T10:45:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Personally, I prefer it how it is, and wouldn't want to see it changed by default.
