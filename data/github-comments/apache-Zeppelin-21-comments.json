Scala->R invocation\n\nYou seem to use rscala and separate connection to make `scala -> r` invocation.\nI think SparkR already have RBackend that support `r -> scala` invocation and the same way we do in PySparkInterpreter, this one way connection can be also used to `scala -> r` without introducing much complexes and additional socket connection.\n\nUsing similar technique that PySparkInterpreter does for py4j in R Interpreter will help \n- Much smaller code base while there are no need for additional socket connection beside the SparkR provided one.\n- More consistent way with already existing PySparkInterpreter\n\n##### 2. KnitR Inteprreter\n\nSeems like calling knit2html() is the role.\nIn this case, i think it more make sense to make a function and inject into RInterpreter (like z.show() in SparkInterpreter), rather than making separate interpreter.\n\n##### 3.

Scala-R invocation\n\nI am not using rscala. \n\nIt is not possible to use the SparkR connection in the way you describe. I did look into this early on. There are numerous packages for interfacing the jvm and R.  None of them use two-way connections.  \n\nThe python-spark and zeppelin integrations you describe leverage an external dependency.  There is no comparable package available for R that has a compatible license. \n\n##### 2. Knitr*\n\nAs I understand, you don't use R, so it may seem strange to have a separate interpreter rather than a function.  That's understandable.  \n\nThe distinction between the r-repl and knitr interpreters makes perfect sense for people who are coming from R.  The repl and knitr handle code, and errors, and output, in fundamentally different ways.  \n\nThey have different capabilities.  It is not possible, consistent with the zeppelin architecture, to put both capabilities into a single interpreter without making the use of that interpreter very unintuitive for someone coming from an R background. \n\nThe knit2html() command is something no R user would ever use when making use of R. It is perhaps best thought of as part of the \"R operating system.\"\n\n##### 3, The author tag\n\nThat's really fine, but in my view this is the lowest-priority possible item.\n\nThe highest priority is the travis build problems.  Travis consistently fails building parts _other_ than rzeppelin.  \n\nThe other high priority is consistency with the Zeppelin-Spark interface, which has grown quite complex and difficult to use.  \n\nMy users have had a long stream of issues getting Spark to work through zeppelin.  They get reported to me as rzeppelin issues, but have all turned out to be issues in the way zeppelin and spark interface, e.g., with conflicts between SPARK_HOME and spark.home.  rzeppelin needs to be consistent with the rest of the Zeppelin architecture in that regard.

You can make two-way `R<->JVM` invocation without any external dependency with the same technique used in PySparkInterpreter.\n\nPySpark implements one way connection `Python->JVM` similar to SparkR.\nPysparkInterpreter leverage this one way connection and successfully made `JVM->Python` invocation without any external dependency. \n\nI guess RInterpreter can do the same, with SparkR.

What KnitR Interpreter doing is basically\n\n```\n     rContext.set(\".zeppknitrinput\", st.split(\"\\n\"))\n     rContext.eval(\".knitout <- knit2html(text=.zeppknitrinput, envir = rzeppelin:::.zeppenv)\")\n     rContext.getS0(\".knitout\")\n```\n\nand basic usage i found from KnitR website is\n\n```\nlibrary(knitr)\n?knit\nknit(input)\n```\n\nSo, to me, it's hard to imagine why functions like `z.knite(input)` does not make sense.\nIf you have use cases, please share.\n\nBy the way, KnitR is GPL license. I don't think Zeppelin can have a feature that depends on GPL licensed code.\n\n> That's really fine, but in my view this is the lowest-priority possible item.\n\nLicense and Copyright problems are one of the highest priority item in Zeppelin project\n\n> The highest priority is the travis build problems. Travis consistently fails building parts other than rzeppelin.\n\nLatest exception from your CI Build is \n\n```\nCaused by: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: PermGen space\n    at org.apache.zeppelin.rinterpreter.RSparkTest$$anonfun$3.apply$mcV$sp(RSparkTest.scala:51)\nAn exception or error caused a run to abort.

Concerning use case, not using nginx, I don't think it's possible to serve saperate Zeppelin instance with, for example, http://some-domain/zeppelin_user1 and http://some-domain/zeppelin_user2 because each Zeppelin has a different port for listening to. Url based deployments is a proper solution for multi user but do you have to launch two Zeppelin instance with two different ports without Nginx? I think only it's possible to serve http://some-domain:port1/zeppelin_user1 and http://some-domain:port2/zeppelin_user2 - actually, zeppelin_user2 is not a mandatory.

The R-Scala Interface\n\nI've explained several times that the proposal to use SparkR bi-directionally doesn't work.   I don't feel that I have more to add about that.  \n\nI will try to reduce the size of the code that originated in rscala. \n\nIf this is not going to be acceptable to the PCCM, please tell me now. \n\n#### 2. KnitR\n\nWhat you're proposing is that users enter the same boilerplate, which they would have to figure out for themselves, every time they want to use knitr. \n\nKnitr and the repl are fundamentally two different ways for users to interact with R.  They have very different behaviors in terms of error reporting and handling visualizations.  \n\nIf you don't want to trust me about this, then I suggest we ask some other R users what makes the most sense.  \n\nIf this is not going to be acceptable to the PCCM, please tell me now. \n\n#### 3. KnitR GPL License\n\n_By the way, KnitR is GPL license. I don't think Zeppelin can have a feature that depends on GPL licensed code._\n\nKnitR is an **optional** external dependency.  This is not a licensing problem.\n\nIt is also not a licensing problem to interact with GPL code that isn't supplied with Zeppelin.\n\nFor example, **R itself** is GPL code.  So it Zeppelin cannot interact with external GPL code, then there cannot be an R interpreter in Zeppelin at all.\n\nConsidering that Spark interacts with R, I think this issue is closed.  \n\n#### 4. License any copyright\n\n_License and Copyright problems are one of the highest priority item in Zeppelin project_\n\nHuh?  What we were talking about is who gets identified in code as the author.  That is obviously not a license/copyright issue, its an issue of credit. \n\nYou said that it is discouraged to identify anybody as the author in Apache projects.\n\nHowever, the current code does identify authors, with you identified as the principal author. \n\nSo, at this point I'm not sure what you're referring to? \n\n#### 5. Location of the Package\n\nIts fine with me if it goes under /spark.  The reason its in /r is that it simplifies testing and development.  Someone will have to merge the two build scripts; I'm using scalatest for testing.  \n\n#### 6. Travis Builds\n\nActually the error in the travis logs begins with this:\n\n> 15/09/23 03:12:22 INFO HiveMetaStore: No user is added in admin role, since config is empty\n> 15/09/23 03:12:24 WARN SparkInterpreter: Can't create HiveContext. Fallback to SQLContext\n> java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException\n>   at sun.reflect.NativeConstructorAccessorImpl.newInstance0(Native Method)\n>   at sun.reflect.NativeConstructorAccessorImpl.newInstance(NativeConstructorAccessorImpl.java:57)\n>   at > > sun.reflect.DelegatingConstructorAccessorImpl.newInstance(DelegatingConstructorAccessorImpl.java:45> )\n>   at java.lang.reflect.Constructor.newInstance(Constructor.java:526)\n\nThat's not coming from rzeppelin.  That's coming from the SparkInterpreter when rzeppelin asks it to initiate a spark backend.  \n\nThis is what I mean about issues in the spark-zeppelin interface.  \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/156865367/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/156868784","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/208#issuecomment-156868784","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/208","id":156868784,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1Njg2ODc4NA==","user":{"login":"elbamos","id":10103420,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTAzNDIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10103420?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbamos","html_url":"https://github.com/elbamos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbamos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbamos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbamos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbamos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbamos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbamos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbamos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbamos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbamos/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-15T23:25:43Z","updated_at":"2015-11-15T23:25:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Leemoonsoo @sourav-mazumder @emaasit @felixcheung \n\nActually, I just watched the youtube video in which, in September, Lee and Felix demo'd this code at the Seattle R users group. \n\nLee, I will be e-mailing you my phone number.

Hi, You're misunderstanding the authorship of codes from Apache project including Zeppelin. What @Leemoonsoo said to you is we have tracked your contribution \"with git commit logs\" not being in codes. You should remove your developer tag in the `r/pom.xml` and delete the files among `r/R/rzeppelin/LICENSE`. If you want to describe some instructions like `r/R/rzeppelin/DESCRIPTION` and `r/R/rzeppelin/README`, please use our documentation rules. You should also delete `r/R/rzeppelin/NEWS` for the same reason. And it's a virtue of not re-indenting any codes you are not editing even though it's wrong. And you divide the supporting of spark 1.4.2 and the being changeable the version of scala to separate issues. This also be a virtue that one issue resolves only one problem.  Even if your codes work perfectly but your contribution ignores general ways. I'm a expert of R, thus I don't know how your codes are good but you should consider several things before you contribute to Zeppelin and another Apache project.\n\n@Leemoonsoo I think that we need to enrich our documentations. The title of this PR doesn't have any connected number of issue from JIRA.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/156900815/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/156904437","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/208#issuecomment-156904437","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/208","id":156904437,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NjkwNDQzNw==","user":{"login":"elbamos","id":10103420,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTAzNDIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10103420?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbamos","html_url":"https://github.com/elbamos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbamos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbamos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbamos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbamos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbamos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbamos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbamos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbamos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbamos/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-16T03:32:25Z","updated_at":"2015-11-16T03:32:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jongyoul \n\nI have no idea what you were trying to say.   \n\nIt appears to me that your primary concern is the names identified in the pom files as the authors?

people can argue, then I see the passion.\nBut when people don't respect each other, it easily become blaming and fighting. \nLet's try to not have blaming and fighting, but productive argue.\n\n@elbamos \n\n#### 1. The R-Scala Interface\n\n> I've explained several times that the proposal to use SparkR bi-directionally doesn't work. I don't feel that I have more to add about that.\n> \n> I will try to reduce the size of the code that originated in rscala.\n> \n> If this is not going to be acceptable to the PCCM, please tell me now.\n\nI described multiple times about PySparkInterpreter made successful bi-directional invocation with one way connection provided by py4j, and the some idea can applied to SparkR.\n\nIt's up to you taking the idea or not. But i just want to mention that:\n- Consider consistent way of communicating from Zeppelin to PySparkInterpreter. That'll later help new contributor understand both PySParkInterpreter, RInterpreter in the same way, together. So can expect more contributors.\n- Less chances of problem, it only requires single socket connection between R and JVM.\n- Code base will be reduced. Easier maintenance as well as faster code review.\n\n#### 2. KnitR\n\n> What you're proposing is that users enter the same boilerplate, which they would have to figure out for themselves, every time they want to use knitr.\n> \n> Knitr and the repl are fundamentally two different ways for users to interact with R. They have very different behaviors in terms of error reporting and handling visualizations.\n> \n> If you don't want to trust me about this, then I suggest we ask some other R users what makes the most sense.\n> \n> If this is not going to be acceptable to the PCCM, please tell me now.\n\nI explained why i'm thinking it can be implemented as a function `z.knitr(input)`.\nYou said you're R user. So i'm asking you, can you please provide some use cases or examples why KnitR need to implemented as a separate Interpreter, not a function? You can show how different KnitR and Repl is, in terms of \n- ways for users to interact\n- error reporting\n- handling visualizations\n\n#### 3. KnitR GPL License\n\n> KnitR is an optional external dependency. This is not a licensing problem.\n> \n> It is also not a licensing problem to interact with GPL code that isn't supplied with Zeppelin.\n> \n> For example, R itself is GPL code. So it Zeppelin cannot interact with external GPL code, then there cannot be an R interpreter in Zeppelin at all.\n> \n> Considering that Spark interacts with R, I think this issue is closed.\n\nI'm not sure how Spark handles license issue with R. My guess is, generally GPL licensed compiler generated output is not applied GPL license. So it could be okay to SparkR give input to R and get output from it and use.\n\nKnitR is i think little bit different. It's running as a library. It is **dynamically linked** with Zeppelin through R.\n\n```\nZeppelin - R - KnitR\n```\n\nIf you think it's okay, that means not only KnitR but any other GPL licensed library can used inside of Zeppelin in the same way.\n\n#### 4. License any copyright\n\n> License and Copyright problems are one of the highest priority item in Zeppelin project\n> \n> Huh? What we were talking about is who gets identified in code as the author. That is obviously not a license/copyright issue, its an issue of credit.\n> \n> You said that it is discouraged to identify anybody as the author in Apache projects.\n> \n> However, the current code does identify authors, with you identified as the principal author.\n> \n> So, at this point I'm not sure what you're referring to?\n\nThe current code with Author tag (at least my name in Author tag) is written before the copyright is transferred to ASF from NFLabs, by signing https://www.apache.org/licenses/software-grant.txt. \n\nAnd thanks for pointing me that there're author tags remains, i'm going to remove that.\nSo please consider your one, too.\n\n#### 6. Travis Builds\n\n> Actually the error in the travis logs begins with this:\n> \n> 15/09/23 03:12:22 INFO HiveMetaStore: No user is added in admin role, since config is empty\n> 15/09/23 03:12:24 WARN SparkInterpreter: Can't create HiveContext. Fallback to SQLContext\n> java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException\n> at sun.reflect.NativeConstructorAccessorImpl.newInstance0(Native Method)\n> at sun.reflect.NativeConstructorAccessorImpl.newInstance(NativeConstructorAccessorImpl.java:57)\n> at > > sun.reflect.DelegatingConstructorAccessorImpl.newInstance(DelegatingConstructorAccessorImpl.java:45> > )\n> at java.lang.reflect.Constructor.newInstance(Constructor.java:526)\n> That's not coming from rzeppelin. That's coming from the SparkInterpreter when rzeppelin asks it to initiate a spark backend.\n> \n> This is what I mean about issues in the spark-zeppelin interface.\n\nYou know what `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: PermGen space` means.\nThen you'll able to fix it no matter where it is coming from. The first thing you can try is increasing PermGem space for the testing.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/157017167/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/157040049","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/208#issuecomment-157040049","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/208","id":157040049,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NzA0MDA0OQ==","user":{"login":"Leemoonsoo","id":1540981,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDA5ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1540981?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo","html_url":"https://github.com/Leemoonsoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-16T14:07:49Z","updated_at":"2015-11-16T14:12:14Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"And if you are not comfortable working with Zeppelin community, not because of you're wrong or Zeppelin community is wrong, but maybe just because of the way we want to go and how we want to get there is little bit different. Keeping RInterpreter as a 3rd party interpreter is another option.\n\nI think in the future, Zeppelin will have more intuitive way to load and run 3rd party Interpreters (although it's already possible without rebuild Zeppelin in a simple way. ie. by deploying binaries under /interpreter and adding configuration into zeppelin-site.xml). Then using 3rd party interpreter will be much more easier. Maybe Just few clicks to download and use it.\n\nSo keeping as a 3rd party interpreter and take more control of it is another way you can choose.\n\nI personally think having SparkR as built-in interpreter is really nice to have for users.\nBut having rich 3rd party interpreter community is also important for Zeppelin. (And that's why Zeppelin community need develop more intuitive way to use 3rd party interpreter).\n\nSo both way, I'm feeling totally fine.

Yesterday I discovered that someone (Felix Cheung) had been demo'ing this code to R user groups on the West Coast, claiming to have done the work. One of the lead Zeppelin developers was present for at least one of these demos.  \n\nShort version of the backstory:  When I'd announced the project to the Zeppelin developer's list, Felix had pleaded to participate. I said \"ok,\" but Felix failed to do any work.  Not a single line of code.  When I told him I was making the PR without him, he threatened that if he was not given credit he would sabotage the project by claiming that the code had been stolen from him.  He carried-through with his threat, and I had to produce chat logs and e-mail chains to demonstrate that he was lying.  Unfortunately, he's apparently also friends with at least one of the lead Zeppelin developers. \n\nIn any event, I will be deciding after the next push how I will move forward. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/157158373/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/157180281","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/208#issuecomment-157180281","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/208","id":157180281,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NzE4MDI4MQ==","user":{"login":"Leemoonsoo","id":1540981,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDA5ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1540981?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo","html_url":"https://github.com/Leemoonsoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-16T21:45:21Z","updated_at":"2015-11-16T21:45:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@elbamos Please do not blame people in your PR.

Thank you for your advise. I tried storing system config values in a DataFactory. That way also has similar duplication. To set the data in that DataFactory after receiving from the Websocket, each controller should have receiver function like the following code. That function code also is duplicated in every controllers.\n\n```\nangular.module('zeppelinWebApp').factory('websocketEvents', function ( ... ) {\n  websocketCalls.ws.onMessage(function(event) {\n    ...\n    } else if (op === 'GET_SYSTEM_CONF') {\n      $rootScope.$broadcast('setSystemConf', data.conf);\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nangular.module('zeppelinWebApp').controller('NotebookCtrl'..., function(...)  {\n  $scope.$on('setSystemConf', function(event, systemConf  {\n    systemConfigDataFactory.setSystemConf(systemConf);\n  });\n```\n\nIf there is another way to set system config data, please let me know.
