the discussion it seems like it's worth a shot to separate the encoding and compression, which I'll call _encoding format_ and _compression strategy_. My interpretation is that _compression strategy_ should be unaware of the data type and size, so it must decompress an entire compressed block to access the content. _encoding format_ is anything that does not fit this description, and it would interpret the uncompressed content from the _compression strategy_.\n\nThis means if the _compression strategy_ is anything other than _none_ (which indicate no compression strategy should be used), then it require block layout. If no strategy is used, then there is no reason to use block layout as it creates overhead by copying uncompressed blocks. So there would be the choice of which _encoding format_ and _compression strategy_ to use, while whether or not to use block layout is determined by the _compression strategy_ chosen.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/227302778/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/227306015","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/3169#issuecomment-227306015","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3169","id":227306015,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNzMwNjAxNQ==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-21T00:08:10Z","updated_at":"2016-06-21T00:11:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@drcrallen When the hit rates are depressed, is the majority of the cluster running 0.9.1 or 0.9.0?
