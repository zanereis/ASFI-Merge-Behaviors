Because it uses separable convolutions instead of the more typical convolution layers in the models I've worked with it's very reasonable that data layout format might have a much smaller impact. Most recently I found that SqueezeNet takes 780ms to run in NCHW format and 182ms to run in NHWC format.

Hence, assuming (and a safe assumption) tight bounds, when loop partition knows if the conditions are either definitely true or false, it is better to go and replace those conditions instead of relying later on the simplifier. \r\n\r\nAlso, the current loop partition logic is recursive. Hence, if the conditions are still floating around then, it is possible that loop partition keeps partitioning based on those conditions and go into an infinite loop.\r\n\r\nWith the introduction of `floordiv` and `floormod`, I find it better to modify `deduce_bound`. \r\n\r\nSo far,  I don't see any case where `deduce_bound` would produce relaxed bounds (given the `LE` case is fixed). \r\n\r\nI can prepare a PR for the deduce_bound for the LE op.

I should have thought about it. Since relay does not support generics in dtype, it seems to me the only way is to have a dynamic tensor definition for each dtype, for instance `tensor_int32_t`, `tensor_float32_t`, etc. Does it make sense? If so, I'd just want to add `tensor_float32_t` this time and add more variants in the future if needed.
