We meant to pursue this further and to suggest a new API on the Spark 3 branch, but other work took precedence. The discussion is over at #590 (TL;DR: seems like we should have a `df.project(StructType)` API).\r\n\r\nSo yes this change will break us once we move to Spark 3. However I want to discuss internally whether we feel strongly about it or not. Will get back to this thread ASAP.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/745059522/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/745063201","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/1931#issuecomment-745063201","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1931","id":745063201,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0NTA2MzIwMQ==","user":{"login":"zhangdove","id":25578853,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NTc4ODUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25578853?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangdove","html_url":"https://github.com/zhangdove","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangdove/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangdove/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangdove/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangdove/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangdove/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangdove/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangdove/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangdove/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangdove/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-15T05:32:44Z","updated_at":"2020-12-15T05:32:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Could you provide the version numbers of Spark and Iceberg?

The surface area of this PR also has decreased (most of it is moving methods around).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/745286527/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/745447983","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/1931#issuecomment-745447983","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1931","id":745447983,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0NTQ0Nzk4Mw==","user":{"login":"cccs-jc","id":56140112,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MTQwMTEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56140112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cccs-jc","html_url":"https://github.com/cccs-jc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cccs-jc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cccs-jc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cccs-jc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cccs-jc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cccs-jc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cccs-jc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cccs-jc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cccs-jc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cccs-jc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-15T17:35:32Z","updated_at":"2020-12-15T21:11:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Iceberg 0.9.0\r\nspark 3.0.0\r\n\r\nClosing this issue.

In a lot of cases, that won't change. For example, bucket always produces ints no matter what the input type. Some transforms, like identity, will produce values of the input type. The only way to change the output type for those transforms is to change the input type through column promotion. When an identity partition column is promoted from int to long or float to double, the partition column is promoted automatically as well and the existing values are promoted on read.\r\n\r\nIn case you're wondering, we were also careful to make sure type promotion doesn't change the result of any partition functions. If the partition transform doesn't produce the same value when it is promoted after transformation, then promotion must be done before the transformation: `bucket(int_col, width)` is actually `bucket((long) int_col, width)`. (This is also one reason why promotion to String is dangerous and not supported.)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/745710832/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/745711250","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1919#issuecomment-745711250","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1919","id":745711250,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0NTcxMTI1MA==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-16T01:52:09Z","updated_at":"2020-12-16T01:52:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for reviewing, @danielcweeks and @johnclara!

The interface can't handle its own state, so it ends up having way more method calls to get state from the child classes. That splits state that should be managed by a single class across multiple places (e.g. buffer growth) and could introduce unnecessary dispatch costs due to the calls.\r\n\r\nWe agreed that it is cleaner to have some code duplication instead, so I'll close this issue.

@HeartSaVioR the reson why i need to use spark and flink is that\r\n> \r\n> 1. flink is not support by partition by hour\r\n>    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5066512/102064596-765c9d00-3e32-11eb-8f7e-081d42afeadb.png)\r\n>    and my table is very huge .  that is not a good parctice\r\n> 2. flink sql is standalone .  my table is huge ,so  i need more resource to run sql   and choose spark\r\n> \r\n> we use flink to write stream data to cos . it is of efficiency\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. you can  create an iceberg table with flink sql\r\n ```\r\nCREATE TABLE iceberg.iceberg_db.iceberg_table (\r\n  id BIGINT COMMENT 'unique id',\r\n  data STRING,\r\n  `day` int\r\n  `hour` int) \r\nPARTITIONED BY (`day`,`hour`)\r\nWITH ('connector'='iceberg','write.format.default'='orc')\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nand write into the iceberg table with flink streaming sql :\r\n\r\n```\r\nINSERT INTO iceberg.iceberg_db.iceberg_table \r\nselect id ,data,DAYOFMONTH(your_timestamp),hour(your_timestamp) from kafka_table\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n2. flink sql client can use standalone cluster and yarn session cluster , you can start a yarn session cluster first ,and then submit the flink sql job to the session cluster .\r\n\r\nand set the parallelism for every flink sql job by the command:\r\n```\r\nset table.exec.resource.default-parallelism = 100\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/747146918/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/747147630","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1917#issuecomment-747147630","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1917","id":747147630,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0NzE0NzYzMA==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-17T01:37:52Z","updated_at":"2020-12-17T01:37:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks

This also applies to UPDATE.\r\n- We should think about how to group data before writing.\r\n- We will need more tests.\r\n\r\nThere are also good to have points (can be done in follow-ups if too much trouble):\r\n- We should use a LEFT ANTI join for merge statements with only `WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT` clause.\r\n- We should use a RIGHT OUTER join for merge statements with only `WHEN MATCHED` clauses.\r\n\r\nLet's discuss each point one by one.\r\n\r\n**Cardinality check**\r\n\r\nSQL standard requires an exception to be thrown if the ON clause in MERGE is such that more than 1 row in source matches a row in target. See [this](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-14949) Hive issue for more info.\r\n\r\nSome systems do the cardinality check all the time while some, like Hive, make it optional. I'd say we should make it optional and let users configure it in the table properties by adding `write.merge.cardinality-check.enabled` property (true by default). The main problem with the cardinality check is the performance penalty: it requires an inner join. We are already doing this inner join for copy-on-write to find matches so we can modify that code to also do the cardinality check at the same time. I don't think we need an inner join for merge-on-read, though. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, I'd vote for having a flag in table properties and make the cardinality check optional (just like Hive ACID).\r\n\r\nWe need to think a bit about how we implement the cardinality check. Here, I am open to suggestions. One idea is to modify nodes for dynamic file filtering. For example, we can use `monotonically_increasing_id` until we have `row_id` metadata column, append it to rows in the target table before the inner join to find matches and then perform the cardinality check and collect matching files. In order to make this efficient, we should reuse as much work as possible.\r\n\r\nOne way to do that is to leverage an accumulator to track matching files:\r\n- append `_row_id` and `_file` columns to the target table\r\n- do an inner join on the merge condition\r\n- define a udf that accepts the file name, adds it to the accumulator and retuns 1\r\n- group by `_row_id`, perform the cardinality check\r\n- access the accumulator to get the matching files\r\n\r\nAnother way is like this:\r\n- append `_row_id` and `_file` columns to the target table\r\n- do an inner join on the merge condition\r\n- select `_row_id`,  `_file` into a separate plan\r\n- temporarily cache the created plan (or persist it on executor nodes)\r\n- perform 2 queries in parallel: one for cardinality check and one for the matching files\r\n- uncache/destroy the temp plan\r\n\r\n**Align assignments**\r\n\r\nI don't think Spark aligns the assignments inside UPDATE or MERGE. We won't be able to support updating nested fields without it. We will probably need a separate rule for this. The same rule can be applied to UPDATE.\r\n\r\n**Group data before writing**\r\n\r\nWe need to think about how to group data before writing new files with our updates and new records. One option is to group and order by partition columns. Another option is to group and order by the sort spec. The third option is to group updates and new records separately. Let's discuss it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/747450897/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/747453154","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1947#issuecomment-747453154","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1947","id":747453154,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0NzQ1MzE1NA==","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-17T13:55:41Z","updated_at":"2020-12-17T13:55:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"BTW, I can work on some of these items in parallel so that we finish this ealier.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/747453154/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/747498481","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1947#issuecomment-747498481","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1947","id":747498481,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0NzQ5ODQ4MQ==","user":{"login":"RussellSpitzer","id":413025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/413025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer","html_url":"https://github.com/RussellSpitzer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-17T15:12:36Z","updated_at":"2020-12-17T15:12:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"One thing we've been talking about it a bit is whether or not it would be useful to tune the write portion of this.

I also have a few suggestions on how to do this more cleanly.\r\n\r\n> We should think about how to group data before writing.\r\n\r\nPlease take a look at #1955. That exposes `_pos` so that we can use it. I would suggest the following:\r\n* If the table has a sort order, add a global sort of all the rows produced by the merge node.\r\n* If the table does not have a sort order, then add a default sort by `_file`, `_pos`, partition columns, and the `MERGE` condition's references. That way, existing rows that have non-null `_file` and `_pos` will mostly preserve the sort order in the source data files (except for changed columns). Inserted rows will have nulls for `_file` and `_pos` and will then be sorted by partition columns to minimize the number of output files, and then by columns from the merge condition because those are likely to be high cardinality (giving Spark the ability to split partitions).\r\n\r\n> We should align the assignments according to the target columns. This also applies to UPDATE.\r\n\r\nAgreed. I think that we should have a rule similar to the logic in [`TableOutputResolver`](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/analysis/TableOutputResolver.scala#L30). One branch would modify `UPDATE` and add expressions to pull unchanged column values from the existing row. Another branch would modify `INSERT` by rearranging the columns by name for `INSERT (_names_) VALUES (_vals_)`.\r\n\r\nAnd we should also have a `MergeOutputCheck` rule to assert that each `INSERT` or `UPDATE` action is aligned with the output of the merge node.\r\n\r\nModifying and checking the logical plan in the analyzer like this will require analyzer rules and a logical plan that doesn't contain `MergeIntoProcessor`. We will need a logical plan that the normal analysis rules can run on. Then we can hopefully remove the resolution from the rewrite as well.\r\n\r\n> We will need more tests\r\n\r\nDefinitely.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/747819953/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/747862370","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/1951#issuecomment-747862370","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1951","id":747862370,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0Nzg2MjM3MA==","user":{"login":"stevenzwu","id":1545663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDU2NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1545663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu","html_url":"https://github.com/stevenzwu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-18T04:36:56Z","updated_at":"2020-12-18T04:36:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"As part of working on the FLIP-27 Flink source, I updated the code with Flink 1.12.0 version.

I have moved AssumeRole part out of the picture and will use another PR for that discussion.\r\n\r\nI agree that it would be cleaner to move the factory out of the `AwsProperties` class. I have created `AwsClientFactories` class for that, following a similar structure as the`LocationProviders` class and made `DefaultAwsClientFactory` an inner class. I think this should make the whole thing much cleaner.\r\n\r\nThe only discussion at this point I believe is about making `AwsClientFactory` serializable or not. I tried about not serializing it, and as a result in S3FileIO I have to do:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nthis.s3 = () -> AwsClientFactories.from(properties)::s3\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn that call above, `properties` got serialized as a part of the serializable supplier, which defeats the purpose of us using `AwsProperties` to store only useful information. So I think making `AwsClientFactory` serializable should still be the way to go there.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what you think, thank you!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/747943701/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/747960726","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1955#issuecomment-747960726","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1955","id":747960726,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0Nzk2MDcyNg==","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-18T09:08:21Z","updated_at":"2020-12-18T09:08:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It looks like vectorized Parquet is failing, @rdblue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/747960726/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/748002552","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1939#issuecomment-748002552","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1939","id":748002552,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0ODAwMjU1Mg==","user":{"login":"openinx","id":5028729,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjg3Mjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5028729?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx","html_url":"https://github.com/openinx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-18T10:13:17Z","updated_at":"2020-12-18T10:13:17Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@stevenzwu  Thanks for your reviewing,  I addressed all the things except the separate issue #1959.  any other concerns ?

That exposes _pos so that we can use it.\r\n\r\nThat is a great PR, let's get it in today.\r\n\r\n> If the table has a sort order, add a global sort of all the rows produced by the merge node.\r\n\r\nWe have this option internally and it works well in some cases. There are a few things we need to be careful about, though.\r\n\r\nFirst, Spark will do a skew estimation step and the actual shuffle using two separate jobs. We don't want to recompute the merge join twice. Internally, we add a repartition stage after the join if a global sort on write is requested. While it does help a bit, it is not ideal. We have seen cases where the sort on write is by far the most expensive step of MERGE.\r\n\r\nSecond, even when we do a global sort, the layout within partitions won't be ideal. So people will most likely have to compact again making the global sort during MERGE redundant.\r\n\r\nThat's why we have to be careful about a global sort by default. I think this ultimately depends on the use case. Shall we make this configurable in table properties? How many query engines will follow it? Should that config be `copy-on-write` specific? I don't have answers to all the questions but it sounds reasonable to explore.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, if we don't do the global sort, we may end up having too many small files after the operation. We can consider doing a repartition by the partition columns and sorting by the sort key but that will suffer if we have a lot of data for a single partition. It would be great to know the number of files and the size of data we need to rewrite per partition to make a good decision here.\r\n\r\nTo sum up this case,\r\n\r\n- global sort -> good but expensive\r\n- repartition and then sort -> less expensive but what if too much data per partition?\r\n\r\n> If the table does not have a sort order, then add a default sort by _file, _pos, partition columns, and the MERGE condition's references.\r\n\r\nSorting updated records by `_file` and `_pos` may be a bit tricky. For example, I have a file with columns (p, c1, c2, c3) in partition 'A' that is sorted by c1 and c2. If I have a merge command that updates c2 column (part of my sort key), my new records will be probably out of order if I sort by `_file` and `_pos`. That said, this is a fallback scenario so it may be not that big a deal. \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/748123544/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/748158267","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/1951#issuecomment-748158267","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1951","id":748158267,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0ODE1ODI2Nw==","user":{"login":"pan3793","id":26535726,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTM1NzI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26535726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793","html_url":"https://github.com/pan3793","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-18T15:31:24Z","updated_at":"2020-12-18T15:31:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Both Iceberg and Flink are changing rapidly, is there necessary to introduce `FlinkShim` which like `HiveShim` to support multiple Flink versions?

I am worried that It can quickly grow out of control, as Flink does a minor version release typically every 4 months. Flink Kafka connector used to be in this model (like kafka08, kafka09, kafka10, ...). Now it moved to the universal connector and just track the latest release version of kafka-clients.\r\n\r\nOr are you suggesting that the Flink connector code can handle all the 1.x Flink versions? I am not sure how flink hive connector handles some of the small API changes among all the versions.\r\n\r\nAs for spark2 and spark3, that is a major version upgrade.

I guess both @zhangjun0x01 and @pan3793 was suggesting the shim layer approach.

I am worried that It can quickly grow out of control, as Flink does a minor version release typically every 4 months. Flink Kafka connector used to be in this model (like kafka08, kafka09, kafka10, ...). Now it moved to the universal connector and just track the latest release version of kafka-clients.\r\n\r\nOr are you suggesting that the Flink connector code can handle all the 1.x Flink versions? I am not sure how flink hive connector handles some of the small API changes among all the versions.\r\n\r\nAs for spark2 and spark3, that is a major version upgrade.

To avoid that, we can use a global sort to plan tasks that are balanced.\r\n\r\nA global sort is a best practice for writing anyway because it clusters data for faster reads.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/748244697/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/748246932","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1947#issuecomment-748246932","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1947","id":748246932,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0ODI0NjkzMg==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-18T18:29:43Z","updated_at":"2020-12-18T18:29:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@aokolnychyi, I agree with the idea to have a flag to disable global sort. Probably best to do this specific to copy-on-write because delta writes will need to be sorted by `_file` and `_pos` for deletes and we expect the inserts to be much, much smaller than the copy-on-write data. If we aren't rewriting retained rows, I think the global sort (with a repartition as you said) would be much cheaper.\r\n\r\nFor sorting by `_file` and `_pos`, what if we only did that for existing rows? We can discard the columns for updated rows. That way we rewrite the data files as though the rows were deleted and append the inserts and updates together. We may even want to do this in all cases: always prepend `_file` and `_pos` to whatever sort order we inject.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/748246932/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/748250068","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/1951#issuecomment-748250068","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1951","id":748250068,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0ODI1MDA2OA==","user":{"login":"stevenzwu","id":1545663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDU2NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1545663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu","html_url":"https://github.com/stevenzwu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-18T18:36:43Z","updated_at":"2020-12-19T22:15:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Definitely see the benefit of supporting multiple Flink versions via a shim layer.

If there are no assignments, then the source table's columns are used to set the output columns by position, using an `Attribute` from the target table as the LHS.\r\n\r\nWe will need an analyzer rule that fills in the missing assignments for update, checks the order of assignments by name, and validates that inserts are complete. I also think that this rule should convert to a different MergeInto logical plan. The plan in Spark is not sufficient because it considers the plan resolved when assignments are resolved, not when the assignments actually produce the expected output. That's strange because resolution produces assignments when there aren't any, but allows them to be missing when some are present.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/748305937/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/748366564","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1948#issuecomment-748366564","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1948","id":748366564,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0ODM2NjU2NA==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-18T23:12:05Z","updated_at":"2020-12-18T23:12:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for reviewing, @holdenk, @RussellSpitzer, and @aokolnychyi!
