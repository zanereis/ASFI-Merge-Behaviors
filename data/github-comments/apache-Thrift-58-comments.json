It's however always also a case-by-case decision. It depends. Whatever makes most sense. Especially as it is \"only\" about tests I probably would drop 3 and 4 altogether and only use 5, but please take that personal opinion with a grain of salt. \r\n\r\n> some cross tests drivers in Java lib is not out of date [...]\r\n\r\nAny way to get that fixed?\r\n\r\n> given I don't see a lot of reviews on Java side of the code lately I wonder if there's any \r\n> mechanism to make sure enough coverage / attention / review there is for major languages.\r\n\r\nYes, that's a constant fight. Some areas are covered by reviewers more than others. I also wonder a bit ... Java is a mainstream language, but we have less activity as say Go and Rust lately. On the other hand, you hardly can't people force to do voluntary work. \r\n\r\n>  you can shed some light on how to better contribute here \r\n\r\nWell. pretty simple actually. \r\n\r\nFirst, we have http://thrift.apache.org/docs/HowToContribute which covers the contribution part.\r\n\r\nPatches and PRs are reviewed by committers either because someone picks it himself or gets asked and then does it. If all sides are happy, it gets merged and the JIRA ticket updated. Only breaking changes should be documented in CHANGES.md, all else in that document will be filled up when we do a release. Of course anyone else is also welcome to review stuff. Given enough eyes all bugs are shallow, as the saying goes. For each committer, it is hard to say if a change beyond a certain level of complexity is good or bad if it is in some subsystem he/she does not understand. One usually leaves these tickets to people more skilled in that area.\r\n\r\nYou might have some luck if you do a post to the dev list asking about a reviewer.

I understand why people like using the gradle wrapper... but the jar shouldn't be in the source tree. If that means no gradle wrapper, then so be it. I understand people feel strongly about this, and want to argue in favor of it, but it can't be there. The one in lib/java should be removed.\r\n\r\nok in that case i'll just symbolically link to the java one so they are identical.\r\n\r\nthere's a way to verify the wrapper jar using sha256sum, i can maybe modify `FindGradlew.cmake` in another pull request to make it more secure.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/1100783377/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/1100783475","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/2556#issuecomment-1100783475","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/2556","id":1100783475,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAS9U85BnJ9z","user":{"login":"jimexist","id":622789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMjc4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/622789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimexist","html_url":"https://github.com/jimexist","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimexist/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimexist/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimexist/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimexist/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimexist/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimexist/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimexist/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimexist/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimexist/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-17T01:34:05Z","updated_at":"2022-04-17T01:34:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> The one in lib/java should be removed.\r\n\r\n@ctubbsii removing that requires significant rework on the build script, i'll probably find another time to do it?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/1100783475/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/1100919488","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/2556#issuecomment-1100919488","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/2556","id":1100919488,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAS9U85BnrLA","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-17T17:23:58Z","updated_at":"2022-04-17T17:23:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> > The one in lib/java should be removed.\r\n> \r\n> @ctubbsii removing that requires significant rework on the build script, i'll probably find another time to do it?\r\n\r\nIt's probably okay as long as the source tarball that is voted on and released doesn't include it. To remove it from git, the easiest thing to do is probably to just have the bootstrap.sh script download it. But, most of the places can probably just call gradle directly and leave it to the user to get the specified version.\r\n\r\nIn any case, it doesn't need to be done as part of this PR, but it probably should be done before the next release. I'm not a PMC member, and releases are ultimately a PMC responsibility.

My current dogfooding is done at master branch but for some of the changes it requires Java lib release and it's a bit hard to keep the process compared to a proper release. Given my best effort to do non-breaking changes I guess a new release before summer can be a patch release instead of a minor one.\r\n\r\nI also don't know the effort involved, which I assume is non-trivial, since there are > 10 languages involved, but I'm willing to try (I personally had experience with publishing to maven central (java), crate (rust), npm (js), pypi (python), etc.). Also I'm not yet a committer (I'm only a committer at another project (Apache Arrow)) and not sure if it's possible.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/apache/thrift/pulls/Jimexist","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/1101400881/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/1101547357","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/2553#issuecomment-1101547357","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/2553","id":1101547357,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAS9U85BqEdd","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-18T16:32:05Z","updated_at":"2022-04-18T16:32:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> > I think this could use a larger explanation.
