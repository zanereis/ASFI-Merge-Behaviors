I like the idea of limiting the download of some attributes, to prevent dos attacks.\r\n\r\nBut I also have two concerns: \r\n- If this nginx is not the front-door, (e.g. Openwhisk is only one of many offerings of one company), than the rate limit would apply on the frontdoor in front of this nginx, right? Then users may experience issues in downloading the CLI, because others do this as well.\r\n- If a company or university wants to introduce OpenWhisk, the students/employees may try to download the CLI at once. In most cases, this is one IP as well. Then the first impression for some of them may be a bad experience.\r\n\r\nA agree, that these two examples are only edge-cases. But I think as this is the first experience of a new user, we have to think about it.\r\n\r\nOne solution to work around this (especially the first problem) may be to make the limits configurable (and add the ability to disable them).\r\n\r\nDo you think it makes sense to write a short test, to check that the limits are really applied?

Currently there’s logic in the ansible deploy that pre-fetches the images listed in ‘runtime_manifest.json’ and therefore needs to know the defaults as defined in application.conf.  Unfortunately, ansible doesn’t natively support parsing application.conf (one of several reasons I dislike the pure config approach).  For the time being, that means I do have to keep that separate list of overrides in group_vars/all.
