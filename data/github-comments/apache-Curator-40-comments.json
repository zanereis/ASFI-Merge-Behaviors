In step 6, which is method checkLeadership(), 0000000083 is what it finds in ourPath. Since ZK did not delete this znode (because its session did not expire yet, and no client deleted it), sortedChildren.indexOf found it and it was the smallest, thus LeaderLatch found a leader with an ephemeral znode of a session, which is already non-relevant for Curator (was replaced by another session), and about to expire in ZK.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604772284/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604772291","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/curator/issues/1018#issuecomment-2604772291","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/1018","id":2604772291,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MDQ3NzIyOTE=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-28T16:55:14Z","updated_at":"2025-01-21T13:42:02Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=shayshim\">shayshim</a>:</i>\n<p>Wasn't Curator connection management suppose to cancel and discard any ongoing BackgroundCallbacks, such as the one in reset(), upon decision to expire a session?</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604772291/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
