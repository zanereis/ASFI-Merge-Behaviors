This seems to be because we’re “compiling” the query every time before checking the cache for it, which results in several requests to our Presto/Hive backend (show partitions, show columns, etc.) to resolve the templates. When we load a dashboard with 20 charts, all with a use of latest partition, it significantly slows down and reduces the usefulness of caching.\r\n\r\nI had a couple possible solutions to this:\r\n1. Only compile the jinja templates that relate to the current user. Your fix was aimed at fixing uses of current_username, maybe we can just special case this here?\r\n2. Cache the results of the queries that compile the jinja templates. That way we wouldn’t need to repeatedly ping Presto/Hive for the partitions/columns in the table.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? \r\ncc @graceguo-supercat @michellethomas ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/525403232/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/525407130","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/7816#issuecomment-525407130","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/7816","id":525407130,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNTQwNzEzMA==","user":{"login":"villebro","id":33317356,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzE3MzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33317356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro","html_url":"https://github.com/villebro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-27T17:39:05Z","updated_at":"2019-08-27T17:39:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I propose introducing a method `uses_jinja_templates()` which checks the query and filters for `{{.*cache_key_wrapper(.*}}` or similar, and if none are present, doesn't do the double compilation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/525407130/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/525418333","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/7611#issuecomment-525418333","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/7611","id":525418333,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNTQxODMzMw==","user":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-27T18:07:36Z","updated_at":"2019-08-27T18:07:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had recent activity.
