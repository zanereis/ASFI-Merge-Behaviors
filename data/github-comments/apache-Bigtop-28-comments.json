\r\nSpark 3.3.4 only supports Python 3.7+, meaning that the default version of Python on many operating systems does not meet this requirement. Simply specifying Python 3 or Python 2 for installation might work, but it won't utilize the system-provided Python. Therefore, the Python requirement in the Spark spec doesn't make sense semantically; a dependency is established, allowing for installation, but it doesn't guarantee usability.\r\n\r\nI believe we can eliminate the Python dependency since Spark's operation does not rely on Python. Only specific functionalities require Python, and users can manually install an appropriate version if needed. Otherwise, managing Spark's Python dependencies within Bigtop would be a disaster.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/comments/2046711441/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/comments/2047405531","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bigtop/pull/1254#issuecomment-2047405531","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/1254","id":2047405531,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACDj7M56CO3b","user":{"login":"iwasakims","id":1856607,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTY2MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1856607?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwasakims","html_url":"https://github.com/iwasakims","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwasakims/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwasakims/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwasakims/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwasakims/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwasakims/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwasakims/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwasakims/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwasakims/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwasakims/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-10T12:24:13Z","updated_at":"2024-04-10T12:24:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> While working on adding pkgSuffix and parent directory to BigTop DEBs,\r\n\r\n@JiaLiangC I am confused by your description.
