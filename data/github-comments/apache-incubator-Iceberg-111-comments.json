Your understanding is correct. For creating iceberg table, the manifest/data files are not needed as the input since they should be eventually linked from the table metadata file, so such relationship should be preserved from the table metadata object and the manifest files in the resources folder. \r\n\r\nFor finding the files introduced, I think https://iceberg.apache.org/spec/#version-2 this could be a good place to check what's strictly required for v1 vs. v2; you can also create a v1 table (follow code path as in https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2887 to find out the setting) and use the created files as starting point. I think we can have such setup for both v1 and v2 tables, so that in future when v3 is introduced we can continue to have this safety guard.

understanding is that you are trying to make the default table location a function of all the other table states, and make this function a potentially pluggable interface. \r\n\r\nThe biggest use case I see is for tables renamed to have the same name as an old table, they will still have a different path and not clobber the data if UUID is a part of the table path. Please let me know if there is any additional important use case that I missed.\r\n\r\nSo to achieve this feature, I think another way is to have a different method in parallel to table builder's `withLocation(String newLoaction)` method called `withTableRootLocationProvider(String providerImpl)` (or this can be from table properties) to supply a root location provider. This provider is basically `Function<TableMetadataBuilder, String>`, and we will fill the null location value based on location provider in the table metadata builder.\r\n\r\nIn the PR that Ryan referenced, I have changed to implement the `TableMetadataUpdateBuilder` that works specifically for the update metadata use case. Given this case, I think it now makes more sense to have a separated `TableMetadataBuilder` to create new table metadata, and we can initialize the location provider and resolve the location in the builder.\r\n\r\nTo make this backwards compatible with existing implementations, we can remove the `defaultWarehouseLocation` method, and instead provide 2 implementations of the provider, which are `HiveTableRootLocationProvider` and `HadoopTableRootLocationProvider`, that should be able to cover all the existing use cases.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/918574306/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/918582832","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2921#issuecomment-918582832","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2921","id":918582832,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX842wHYw","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-13T21:14:55Z","updated_at":"2021-09-13T21:14:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think this will be a valuable addition.

have also been following this thread although I did no make any comment. Let me add some thoughts since I see you are making some new changes.\r\n\r\nI am mostly on the same line of thought as @stevenzwu, I am a bit worried about the scalability of the current implementation, and I think the parallel commit proposal that @rdblue proposed could work, but in the end running compaction in streaming pipeline is likely unnecessary complication. \r\n\r\nSo far we have been advocating for streaming pipelines to just commit new files to storage, and use a separated process to handle compaction at the same time. Having the streaming pipeline also do compaction would mean that there might be 2 compaction processes competing with each other. This becomes especially complicated and prone to error when you have both batch jobs and streaming pipelines running at the same time (e.g. normal streaming + daily loading of corrected and late data). I understand it is likely a good optimization for simple use cases, but I would expect it to be a feature with a lot of in-depth knowledge to use safely and correctly if we open it for general usage.\r\n\r\nI wonder what is the initial drive behind this implementation. Do you just want to avoid a separated Spark cluster to run compaction in Spark? If we have Flink actions specifically for `RewriteDataFiles` and `RewriteDeleteFiles` that you can schedule on the same Flink cluster, would that solve the issue?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/918632602/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/918634163","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/3109#issuecomment-918634163","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3109","id":918634163,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX842wT6z","user":{"login":"RussellSpitzer","id":413025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/413025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer","html_url":"https://github.com/RussellSpitzer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-13T22:35:06Z","updated_at":"2021-09-13T22:35:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@rdblue As far as I could tell there was no explicit reason for this behavior but I was wondering if there is some Spark Code somewhere that will be unhappy with us if we list Iceberg tables as well.

But if some of the files owned by the old snapshot are deleted by mistake.\r\n\r\n@coolderli Thanks for your attention, but I think we don't need to worry about this case, because 'IcebergFilesCommitter' only validate the data files which are referenced by the not commited pos-delete files. And pos-delete file will only referenced the same txn data file. That is mean the referenced data files will not owned by other snapshot and only will be the uncommitted data files.\r\n\r\nSo I don't think your case will happend, but we can go a step further and discuss all possible situations. We assume that the table already has a historical snapshot.\r\n\r\n**Case-1:**  flink job **first start** and **not** uncommitted data.\r\n`IcebergFilesCommitter` will do nothing and `lastCommittedSnapshotId` will be init as init value(-1).\r\n\r\n**Case-2:**  flink job **restore** from checkpoint and **not** uncommitted data.\r\n`IcebergFilesCommitter` will do nothing and `lastCommittedSnapshotId` will be init as init value(-1).\r\n\r\n**Case-3:**  flink job **restore** from checkpoint and **have** uncommitted data.\r\n`IcebergFilesCommitter` will commit all uncommitted data. First, `lastCommittedSnapshotId` will be init as init value(-1), and then committer will validate all data files which is referenced by uncommitted pos-delete files from current snapshot to `lastCommittedSnapshotId`. Because `lastCommittedSnapshotId` value is -1, so committer will travel all snapshot history to ensure data files still exist and guarantee all snapshot history are valid. After that, `lastCommittedSnapshotId` will be update to the commited snapshotId.\r\n\r\n**Case-4:**  flink job keep **running** and **not** uncommitted data.\r\n`IcebergFilesCommitter` will do nothing and `lastCommittedSnapshotId` will keep its value.\r\n\r\n**Case-5:**  flink job keep **running** and **have** uncommitted data.\r\n`IcebergFilesCommitter` will commit all uncommitted data, and validate all referenced data files from current snapshot to `lastCommittedSnapshotId`. And then update `lastCommittedSnapshotId` the commited snapshotId. That can ensure all referenced data files are exist and not be delete between to commit.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/919073751/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/919073754","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/3114#issuecomment-919073754","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3114","id":919073754,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX842x_Pa","user":{"login":"openinx","id":5028729,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjg3Mjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5028729?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx","html_url":"https://github.com/openinx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-14T11:46:55Z","updated_at":"2021-09-14T11:49:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I've checked the behavior by using iceberg master branch (git commit-id: 838cc652273c1444155bec2e1d6029cfbdbf3ea3) and flink 1.12,  all work as expected: \r\n\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE iceberg_table_v2 (\r\n    id   BIGINT,\r\n    data STRING,\r\n    PRIMARY KEY (id) NOT ENFORCED\r\n) WITH (\r\n     'connector'='iceberg',\r\n     'format-version' = '2',\r\n     'catalog-name'='hadoop_prod',\r\n     'catalog-type'='hadoop',\r\n     'write.upsert.enable'='true',\r\n     'warehouse'='file:///Users/openinx/test/iceberg-warehouse'\r\n);\r\n\r\nselect * from iceberg_table_v2;\r\n+----+------+\r\n| id | data |\r\n+----+------+\r\n0 row in set\r\n\r\nINSERT INTO iceberg_table_v2 VALUES (14, 'test14'), (14, 'test14_update');\r\n[INFO] Submitting SQL update statement to the cluster...\r\n[INFO] Table update statement has been successfully submitted to the cluster:\r\nJob ID: 083d3008e12bc533aacec0c2bdae9d0a\r\n\r\nselect * from iceberg_table_v2;\r\n+----+---------------+\r\n| id |          data |\r\n+----+---------------+\r\n| 14 | test14_update |\r\n+----+---------------+\r\n1 row in set\r\n\r\nINSERT INTO iceberg_table_v2 VALUES (14, 'test14_3');\r\n[INFO] Submitting SQL update statement to the cluster...\r\n[INFO] Table update statement has been successfully submitted to the cluster:\r\nJob ID: 9528163e8d06db33c090c16d9a858b45\r\n\r\nselect * from iceberg_table_v2;

Last time I checked, this PR runs the whole rewrite action in the single committer task synchronously. that is the main scalability concern we have.\r\n\r\nAlso notifyCheckpointComplete (and snapshotState) executes in the mailbox thread. if it takes a long time to finish the notifyCheckpointComplete/rewrite, it can delay the checkpoint execution.\r\n\r\nI share the same philosophy as Jack on keep the streaming ingestion simple and stable.

So rather than checking the same metastore for Iceberg and then non Iceberg tables, we first check one catalog for Iceberg and then check a different catalog for non-Iceberg. \r\n So if I call \"Create Database\" this gets run on the Delegate Metastore, so now the delegate metastore has a new database.

There's definitely some value in the regular builder pattern where you can mostly copy fields and just make calls to change values. But I think adding a builder could bring more value if we actually moved the implementations of the `TableMetadata` modifications into the builder. So what I was thinking was to basically move all of the methods like `replaceCurrentSnapshot` and `removeSnapshotsIf` into the builder itself.\r\n\r\nThat approach allows us to make more than one change without adding special handling for `upgradeToFormatVersion`. We could chain changes to produce a new `TableMetadata` because the methods keep track of table state.\r\n\r\nA second benefit that I'm interested in is tracking the high-level changes the led to a new `TableMetadata` object. We're building a REST-based catalog and I think this is the first step to an update that posts just what changed. For example, `replaceCurrentSnapshot` could produce a new `TableMetadata`, but also keep track of the facts that (1) a new snapshot was added and (2) the current snapshot was set to that snapshot's ID. Those granular changes make a REST protocol much more efficient.\r\n\r\nDoes that motivation make sense?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/920477110/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/920536151","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/3118#issuecomment-920536151","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3118","id":920536151,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX8423kRX","user":{"login":"Reo-LEI","id":17312872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzEyODcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17312872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reo-LEI","html_url":"https://github.com/Reo-LEI","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reo-LEI/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reo-LEI/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reo-LEI/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reo-LEI/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reo-LEI/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reo-LEI/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reo-LEI/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reo-LEI/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reo-LEI/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-16T02:57:20Z","updated_at":"2021-09-16T02:57:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Are you sure that this is the right approach?

On the one hand, user usually need to query the latest data in streaming case, And these data may not have been rewritten yet. On the other hand,  as you said, the best way is to rewrite and merge the delete files into data files, but the rewrite is depend on read. So we should optimizing the `DeleteFilter` and read delete files in parallel to speed up the read and rewrite. \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/920536151/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/920547971","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/3118#issuecomment-920547971","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3118","id":920547971,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX8423nKD","user":{"login":"Reo-LEI","id":17312872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzEyODcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17312872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reo-LEI","html_url":"https://github.com/Reo-LEI","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reo-LEI/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reo-LEI/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reo-LEI/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reo-LEI/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reo-LEI/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reo-LEI/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reo-LEI/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reo-LEI/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reo-LEI/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-16T03:31:00Z","updated_at":"2021-09-16T03:32:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Actually, in our production environment, we sync our mysql data to iceberg v2 by flink.
