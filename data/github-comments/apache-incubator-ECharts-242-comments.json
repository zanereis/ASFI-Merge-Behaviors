think there are some pretty common scenarios which exactly require this feature. \r\nHere some examples when thinking about displaying car sales in a bar chart: \r\n- Displaying the number of sold cars per manufacturer and year. There will be manufacturers which don't have car sales in every year since they didn't exist at that time or already went bankrupt. So you don't want that the space is preserved for them since there are some fluctuations over the years and otherwise the chart would look really scattered and not very readable.\r\n\r\n- Displaying the number of sold cars per manufacturer and model. Obviously, each manufacturer has a different number of models and each model is unique per manufacturer.\r\n\r\nPlease note, these are just hypothetical scenarios and the amount of data displayed in a single chart might be too big, but you can easily adjust it by only displaying the top 10 per series. I'm also aware, that in some cases stacked bars might be a valid workaround, but often they are not serving the purpose. These examples should just show that it is pretty common to have varying categories over multiple series. \r\n\r\nIn general, I think it is a highly beneficial feature to have the option to configure to don't preserve space for bars which don't have any data.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/545316507/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/545319628","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/echarts/pull/11285#issuecomment-545319628","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/11285","id":545319628,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NTMxOTYyOA==","user":{"login":"381510688","id":9478986,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0Nzg5ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9478986?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/381510688","html_url":"https://github.com/381510688","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/381510688/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/381510688/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/381510688/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/381510688/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/381510688/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/381510688/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/381510688/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/381510688/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/381510688/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-23T07:58:59Z","updated_at":"2019-10-23T07:59:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"什么时间正式发布？
