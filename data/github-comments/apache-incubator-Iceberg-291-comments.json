If we keep this, then we should be sure that we do not need specific table data (even by batches). The code for generating `TableIdentifier`s for every table is very different than the filtered solution - we might want to keep the code separated (different method, or a clearly different code path inside of a single method). Also we can decide that we do not want to support this feature, but that is a different discussion/PR etc.\r\n2. If we see that there are code duplications (HiveTableOperations/HiveViewOperations) then I prefer one of the following 2 methods:\r\n    - Do the refactor in a 1st PR, to extract the code which will be reused, and in a 2nd PR add the new feature. It is fine to do the WIP PR to decide which will be the common parts, but we should not commit code which is not production ready.\r\n    - Do the refactor and the new feature in the same PR. It is viable only for small refactors.\r\n3. We should decide if we want to have the same error messages for the `HiveCatalog` that are used by the other Catalogs. If we think so, then it would be great if the new error messages (for the Views) should be the same.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1798279159/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1798296469","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/8994#issuecomment-1798296469","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/8994","id":1798296469,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85rL9OV","user":{"login":"pvary","id":19705742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzA1NzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19705742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary","html_url":"https://github.com/pvary","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-07T11:10:51Z","updated_at":"2023-11-07T11:10:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@innocent123:

Could you please check which execution engine you are using?\r\n\r\nMy guess is, that you are using `set hive.execution.engine=tez`. And it is working for reads, but not supported for writes. The execution of the insert is finished, but the data files are not added to the Iceberg table.\r\n\r\nI would suggest to try out Hive 4.0.0, as it has out-of-the-box support for Iceberg tables.\r\n\r\nYou can find the supported features / engines here: https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/latest/hive/\r\n\r\n> \r\n> Iceberg compatibility with Hive 2.x and Hive 3.1.2/3 supports the following features:\r\n> \r\n> - Creating a table\r\n> - Dropping a table\r\n> - Reading a table\r\n> - Inserting into a table (INSERT INTO)\r\n>\r\n> DML operations work only with MapReduce execution engine.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1798483588/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1798689331","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/8988#issuecomment-1798689331","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/8988","id":1798689331,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85rNdIz","user":{"login":"nastra","id":271029,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MTAyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/271029?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra","html_url":"https://github.com/nastra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-07T14:42:25Z","updated_at":"2023-11-07T14:42:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@manuzhang
