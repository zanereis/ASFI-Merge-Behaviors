thanks for your excellent review firstly.\r\n1. There are comments on the key methods, and the class name directly describes the role of the current class.\r\n2. Some corner cases have been considered and verified，and for the problem of put half message back failed, in fact, we only send a check request after the put back is successful. and if put back failed, we will continue to process this message, and in order to avoid causing unlimited check，we also added the limit of check times for the message, and in this situation, we will also print an error log for easy monitoring and manual processing. \r\n3. In fact, the HA mechanism of the transaction message depends on the HA of the rocketMQ itself. In order to avoid the message not being lost, we recommend using the synchronous double-write mechanism and manually upgrading the slave when the master down.\r\n4. I have been changed the identifier to the full-word.\r\n5. I don't think it's an excessive abstraction, I think transaction message is an application of ordinary message, so I need a bridge to avoid directly manipulating the relevant storage of MQ. \r\n6. Some hard code have  been removed, please review the latest commit.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/404995102/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/404995112","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/287#issuecomment-404995112","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/287","id":404995112,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNDk5NTExMg==","user":{"login":"vongosling","id":635581,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNTU4MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/635581?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling","html_url":"https://github.com/vongosling","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-14T03:24:13Z","updated_at":"2018-07-14T03:24:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I

the ROCKETMQ_HOME to the directory where the built package is the default value should be ${ROCKETMQ_PROJECT}/distribution/target/apache-rocketmq\r\n- you may check the ROCKETMQ_HOME value in your cmd shell by `echo %ROCKETMQ_HOME%`\r\n- If you run the script `mqnamesrv.cmd` in the terminal of IDE (e.g. Intellij idea), try to restart the IDE\r\n\r\nWish that can provide some intiutions for you.
