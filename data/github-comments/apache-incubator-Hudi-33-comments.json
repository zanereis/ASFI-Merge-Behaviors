Hoping that things run fine on Travis too. To give an overview, there were 3 major failures happening:\r\n\r\n1. The `ITTestHoodieSanity` tests were failing firstly becuase of this error:\r\n```\r\n17:15:31.995 [pool-21-thread-2] ERROR org.apache.hudi.io.HoodieCreateHandle - Error writing record HoodieRecord{key=HoodieKey { recordKey=98ea14b7-b318-4b0b-9f14-0115900a10e0 partitionPath=2016/03/15}, currentLocation='null', newLocation='null'}\r\n\r\njava.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.apache.parquet.io.api.Binary.fromCharSequence(Ljava/lang/CharSequence;)Lorg/apache/parquet/io/api/Binary;\r\n\r\n\tat org.apache.parquet.avro.AvroWriteSupport.fromAvroString(AvroWriteSupport.java:371) ~[hudi-spark-bundle-0.5.1-SNAPSHOT.jar:0.5.1-SNAPSHOT]\r\n\r\n\tat org.apache.parquet.avro.AvroWriteSupport.writeValueWithoutConversion(AvroWriteSupport.java:346) ~[hudi-spark-bundle-0.5.1-SNAPSHOT.jar:0.5.1-SNAPSHOT]\r\n\r\n\tat org.apache.parquet.avro.AvroWriteSupport.writeValue(AvroWriteSupport.java:278) ~[hudi-spark-bundle-0.5.1-SNAPSHOT.jar:0.5.1-SNAPSHOT]\r\n\r\n\tat org.apache.parquet.avro.AvroWriteSupport.writeRecordFields(AvroWriteSupport.java:191) ~[hudi-spark-bundle-0.5.1-SNAPSHOT.jar:0.5.1-SNAPSHOT]\r\n\r\n\tat org.apache.parquet.avro.AvroWriteSupport.write(AvroWriteSupport.java:165) ~[hudi-spark-bundle-0.5.1-SNAPSHOT.jar:0.5.1-SNAPSHOT]\r\n\r\n\tat org.apache.parquet.hadoop.InternalParquetRecordWriter.write(InternalParquetRecordWriter.java:121) ~[hive-exec-2.3.1.jar:1.10.1]\r\n\r\n\tat org.apache.parquet.hadoop.ParquetWriter.write(ParquetWriter.java:288) ~[hive-exec-2.3.1.jar:1.10.1]\r\n\r\n\tat org.apache.hudi.io.storage.HoodieParquetWriter.writeAvroWithMetadata(HoodieParquetWriter.java:91) ~[hudi-spark-bundle-0.5.1-SNAPSHOT.jar:0.5.1-SNAPSHOT]\r\n\r\n\tat org.apache.hudi.io.HoodieCreateHandle.write(HoodieCreateHandle.java:101) ~[hudi-spark-bundle-0.5.1-SNAPSHOT.jar:0.5.1-SNAPSHOT]\r\n\r\n\tat org.apache.hudi.io.HoodieWriteHandle.write(HoodieWriteHandle.java:150) ~[hudi-spark-bundle-0.5.1-SNAPSHOT.jar:0.5.1-SNAPSHOT]\r\n\r\n\tat org.apache.hudi.func.CopyOnWriteLazyInsertIterable$CopyOnWriteInsertHandler.consumeOneRecord(CopyOnWriteLazyInsertIterable.java:142) ~[hudi-spark-bundle-0.5.1-SNAPSHOT.jar:0.5.1-SNAPSHOT]\r\n\r\n\tat org.apache.hudi.func.CopyOnWriteLazyInsertIterable$CopyOnWriteInsertHandler.consumeOneRecord(CopyOnWriteLazyInsertIterable.java:125) ~[hudi-spark-bundle-0.5.1-SNAPSHOT.jar:0.5.1-SNAPSHOT]\r\n\r\n\tat org.apache.hudi.common.util.queue.BoundedInMemoryQueueConsumer.consume(BoundedInMemoryQueueConsumer.java:38) ~[hudi-spark-bundle-0.5.1-SNAPSHOT.jar:0.5.1-SNAPSHOT]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is happening because in Hudi even for bits running through Spark we are using `Hive 2.3.1` which is not really compatible with Spark. So, `hive-exec 2.3.1` ends up in `HoodieJavaApp` classpath while running the example, and that has its own shaded parquet version which is old and conflicts with `parquet 1.10.1`.\r\n\r\nWhat I propose here, is that we should use version of Hive that is compatible with Spark, atleast for the bits running inside Spark so that compatible versions of Hive end up in class paths. Now `hive-exec 1.2.1.spark2` does not cause this issue as it does not shade parquet. Also, we have removed Hive shading in master now, so anyways we are dependent on runtime Hive version which is Spark's Hive version. So, from code's perspective also I think it makes sense to depend on Spark's Hive version for the code which is running inside of Spark to avoid such issues.\r\n\r\n2. Post that `ITTestHoodieSanity` all the `_rt` tests were failing because now that our code is using `Avro 1.8.2` and Hive is still on older versions, we need to shade avro in `hudi-hadoop-mr-bundle` which we had done internally for EMR through an optional profile. Now that we are migrating Hudi itself to Avro 1.8.2 we need to always shade Hive to get around this issue. More details on https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-268\r\n\r\n3. Finally some tests were failing because `spark-avro` was not being passed while starting the spark-shell, and it was not finding the classes. So, I switched over to downloading `spark-avro` instead of `databricks-avro`\r\n\r\nBy making the above changes, the integration tests work now.

Ideally we should also add a few \"receipes\" to the integ test and have them passing too. \r\n\r\n@yanghua while I agree with you that ideally, we phased this as smaller checkins. But this one is a special case, since it was started even before incubating...

And that is the reason its ending up in tests classpath. We would have to get rid of `hive-service` if we were to do that.\r\n\r\nAlso I don't see any artifact like `hive-exec-core`. Maven does not recognize it. But besides that, when we are depending on runtime Spark's version of Hive, is there any reason why we are wanting to build it with hive 2.x instead ? May be `hudi-hive` in itself since that is an independent module makes sense to build with hive 2.x. But anything running within spark, why are we inclined to building with version of hive not supported by spark ?

Let me add some more context here.\r\n\r\nFirstly, hive-exec has a classifier `core` that allows you to get a dependency reduced version of the jar. Although this allows us to workaround the fat jar problem, there is another problem with this dependency reduced version of the jar which doesn't package some of the required transitive dependencies needed by classes in this jar. There are ways to fix this as well by including those relocated dependencies directly in Hudi (@modi95 was trying it at Uber)\r\n\r\nSecondly, there is no support for Spark's fork of Hive (1.2.1.spark.2). This was forked by the Spark community to solve the exact issue of hive jars not bundling the correct dependencies that I described above, read more here : https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-16391?focusedCommentId=16032497&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-16032497 and then some more changes were added to the fork which are NOT necessary according to the comments in the same jira. \r\n\r\nIn fact, there is a strong need in the spark community to move away from this forked version to the regular hive version. See here : http://apache-spark-developers-list.1001551.n3.nabble.com/DISCUSS-Upgrade-built-in-Hive-to-2-3-4-td26153.html.\r\n\r\nBut I see your point on having the spark-modules depend on the spark-hive version, this way it's clear and we don't have to solve this issue ourselves.\r\n\r\nI have a few hesitations in introducing a spark's forked hive version : a) This means we have 2 hive versions across the project b) The spark's forked version of hive doesn't have anything more apart from solving the hive-exec jar mess. \r\nI'm actually okay with (b). @vinothchandar @bvaradar If you're okay with (a) and don't see any issues, I'm fine with taking this approach. Personally, don't have much foresight on the side-effects of having different versions across the project in the future.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/555386022/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/555396324","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/1024#issuecomment-555396324","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1024","id":555396324,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NTM5NjMyNA==","user":{"login":"hddong","id":17537134,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTM3MTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17537134?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hddong","html_url":"https://github.com/hddong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hddong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hddong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hddong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hddong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hddong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hddong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hddong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hddong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hddong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-19T08:45:22Z","updated_at":"2019-11-19T08:45:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@leesf all of `Schema.parse` fixed, and I think we can merge this first.
