Concept looks good. But why introduce a new block type and not do it for the HoodieHFileDataBlock itself?\r\n> \r\n> When the HFile format is used, whether for Metadata Table or elsewhere in HUDI, there will always be a key for the HFile and they will be derived from some field of the record. Hence, this HFile key will always be redundant. Therefore this optimization needs to performed for HoodieHFileDataBlock itself.\r\n> \r\n> HoodieHFileDataBlock already accepts a \"keyField\". We can simply this change by:\r\n> \r\n> 1. If keyField is not None:\r\n>    \r\n>    * set keyField to \"null\" and do not save it\r\n>    * materialize the keyField from HFile key\r\n> 2. If keyField is None - no need to do the above\r\n\r\nI was initially proposing to go with a new on-disk block type like HFILE_METADATA_BLOCK to differentiate from other HFILE_DATA_BLOCKS. But, that makes on-disk block format change and hence not backward compatible and downgrades would not work. So, later on further discussion made this choice of layering this such a way that metadata record specific key deduplication logic doesn't get spilled over into the lower most HFile block layer. Also, this code structuring gives us the benefit of restricting the functionality only to specific users of HFile, here Metadata table and not to all. \r\n\r\nPreviously, the HFile block layer had the hard coded keyField = \"key\" assuming the record payload would always have this key. But it is true only for the metadata payload. Also, it didn't sit well with the config \"populate meta fields\" where the key could be different based on the table user. So, to support virtual keys for the metadata table we had to pull out the abstraction to higher layers.

After discussing with @nsivabalan offline, and also confirming from the code that this will avoid the duplicate key issue but it will create duplicate data with different file ids. This adversely affects data correctness. \r\n\r\nThis scenario would happen only when there is no data or so less data that deltastreamer finishes one round pretty fast, even before clustering, and there is no min sync interval between rounds. I think it's okay to fail the clustering due to duplicate key in this scenario. As a workaround users could set OCC mode or add delay between rounds of delta sync.

SparkRDDWriteClient constructor attempts to create the MT Writer (and there by the bootstrapping) if there is no upgrade needed. In our case, after upgrade to 0.10, the first time this code path will not be taken. \r\n2. However, for each table operation like insert*/upsert/bulkInsert, the client gets the table and inits the context via `SparkRDDWriteClient#getTableAndInitCtx()`. This is mostly one which triggers the actual table upgrade for the first time.\r\n   2.1 After the upgrade it creates the MT writer which then triggers the bootstrapping\r\n   2.2 MT bootstrapping fails as there are pending actions on the timeline\r\n   2.3 The writer goes and initiates the respective action executors \r\n3. At the time of commit/finalizewrite, attempt is made to write to the MT. Action executors call HoodieSparkTable#getMetadataWriter(). This is where the next problem is\r\n4. Before the fix, as a perf optimization, a flag `isMetadataAvailabilityUpdated` is used to detect MT available or not. After the first check, if for any reason the MT is not ready (which is my testing case, after upgrade bootstrapping failed due to a  pending table service action), the other flag `isMetadataTableAvailable` is set to false. Now we have the `isMetadataAvailabilityUpdated=true` = true and  `isMetadataTableAvailable=false`. This is the spark table which is going to be used by the write client for any subsequent table operations. So, all these subsequent table operations are short circuited   because of the flags and never try to re-read the MT availability.\r\n\r\n5. Later, if the async table services are enabled, a clustering thread would come to repair the timeline for any pending actions. If the async table services are not enabled, which is the case in my testing, then there would be no one to repair the pending action. Assuming the timeline is repaired now, it is good for MT bootstrapping again. But, some one should attempt the writer creation agian.\r\n6. Lets say we have this single writer in continuous mode still running and no other writer client. Yes, each table operatios is calling `HoodieSparkTable#getMetadataWriter()` to get the writer, but they don't attempt to create the MT again because of the flags.\r\n\r\nWhat will save us:\r\n1. Creation of new writer client\r\n2. Change in schema which will force the existing writer client to re-init the context including the MT writer \r\n3. Async table service operations repairing the timeline\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/979410799/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/979412885","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/4060#issuecomment-979412885","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/4060","id":979412885,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM46YKeV","user":{"login":"alexeykudinkin","id":428277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin","html_url":"https://github.com/alexeykudinkin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-25T18:23:39Z","updated_at":"2021-11-25T18:23:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I don't think this is a particularly well-suited approach in this case: not having fixed content of the fixtures will lead to every test run having different outputs, making it a moving target whenever you're debugging, which is what i would like to avoid.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/979412885/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/979418152","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/4120#issuecomment-979418152","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/4120","id":979418152,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM46YLwo","user":{"login":"hudi-bot","id":79415918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDE1OTE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79415918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/hudi-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-25T18:38:27Z","updated_at":"2021-11-25T18:38:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\nMeta data\n{\n  \"version\" : 1,\n  \"metaDataEntries\" : [ {\n    \"hash\" : \"06cc1e380ad140001f0d7fb33ad94395895cf9a3\",\n    \"status\" : \"UNKNOWN\",\n    \"url\" : \"TBD\",\n    \"triggerID\" : \"06cc1e380ad140001f0d7fb33ad94395895cf9a3\",\n    \"triggerType\" : \"PUSH\"\n  }, {\n    \"hash\" : \"2da082d547ac41fa7ab2bbcd4501c1e66ac71325\",\n    \"status\" : \"DELETED\",\n    \"url\" : \"https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=3757\",\n    \"triggerID\" : \"2da082d547ac41fa7ab2bbcd4501c1e66ac71325\",\n    \"triggerType\" : \"PUSH\"\n  }, {\n    \"hash\" : \"2f5405ee7fac6365b9b74381ba934832b1eda2d4\",\n    \"status\" : \"FAILURE\",\n    \"url\" : \"https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=3760\",\n    \"triggerID\" : \"2f5405ee7fac6365b9b74381ba934832b1eda2d4\",\n    \"triggerType\" : \"PUSH\"\n  } ]\n}-->\n## CI report:\n\n* 06cc1e380ad140001f0d7fb33ad94395895cf9a3 UNKNOWN\n* 2f5405ee7fac6365b9b74381ba934832b1eda2d4 Azure: [FAILURE](https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=3760) \n\n<details>\n<summary>Bot commands</summary>\n  @hudi-bot supports the following commands:\n\n -

When you say different jobs are started - you are referring to the duplicate jobs you see ? tbh given the input `writeResult.getWriteStatuses.rdd` is cached already, not sure if its a needle mover one way or other.\r\n\r\n@vinothchandar \r\n\r\nAll transformations in Spark are lazy, in that they do not compute their results right away. Instead, they just remember the transformations applied to some base dataset (e.g. a file). The transformations are only computed when an action requires a result to be returned to the driver program.\r\nIn the scenario we're talking about，the data is written to data files only after isEmpty or count is executed. Data in all partitions needs to be written to data files during data saving. Therefore, the total number of tasks to be executed for the isEmpty mothed are the same with the count mothed.\r\nAssume that 1000 tasks need to be executed and 1000 computing resources are available. The isEmpty method will divide 1000 tasks into six batches and each batch has 1, 5, 25, 125, 625 and 219 tasks (\r\nAs shown in the preceding figure, three tasks are divided into 2 batches. Each batch contains 1 and 2 tasks). In the isEmpty method, each batch is serially executed and the next batch of tasks is executed only after a batch of tasks is executed。In the count method, 1000 tasks are executed as a batch. When computing resources are sufficient, the time consumed by isEmpty is six times that consumed by count.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/980482343/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/980482925","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/4134#issuecomment-980482925","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/4134","id":980482925,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM46cPtt","user":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-27T01:35:52Z","updated_at":"2021-11-27T01:35:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@hudi-bot azure run","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/980482925/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/980483111","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/3952#issuecomment-980483111","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3952","id":980483111,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM46cPwn","user":{"login":"yihua","id":2497195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTcxOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2497195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua","html_url":"https://github.com/yihua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-27T01:38:02Z","updated_at":"2021-11-27T01:38:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@xiarixiaoyao @vinothchandar the bundle dependency issue is resolved.
