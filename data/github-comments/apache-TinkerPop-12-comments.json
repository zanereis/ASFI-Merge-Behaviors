A note in this section:\n\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-tinkerpop/blob/tp31/docs/src/upgrade/release-3.1.x-incubating.asciidoc#graph-database-providers\n\nthat explains that graph providers should no longer rely on the test suite to validate that hypens work for property keys would be a worthwhile comment. Please also add an entry to the CHANGELOG \n\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-tinkerpop/blob/tp31/CHANGELOG.asciidoc#tinkerpop-313-not-officially-released-yet\n\nwhich would make this PR fully complete.

i never noticed that you replied to my post in jira @lewismc - i'll just say that i basically agree with what you wrote there. we can push off the SEO stuff to another ticket. i'm fine with that. i guess what i'm still concerned about here is the situation where someone does a `publish-docs.sh` for 3.2.1-SNAPSHOT, and then someone else turns around and does one for 3.1.3-SNAPSHOT. In that case, what's in \"current\" is just constantly being shifted around. I also don't think we we want to promote a SNAPSHOT as \"current'. We should make \"current\" our most recent production release that we primarily promote on the web site - so our \"current\", if we did this today would be a copy of 3.2.0-incubating. \n\nI think that there should be something in the script that doesn't bother to update \"current\" if the version is SNAPSHOT. I don't know what we do about the actual release versions to prevent 3.1.6 from one day overwriting 3.3.0.

My initial test of this on 3.2.1-SNAPSHOT docs worked when \"current\" did not exist thus creating it and pointing at 3.2.0-incubating. A second test also worked where a build of 3.1.3-SNAPSHOT docs published but didn't change \"current\" from pointing at 3.2.0-incubating. The only piece i haven't covered is an actual deployment of an official release. I suppose we won't know for sure if that's all good until we deploy 3.2.1/3.1.3 officially.\n\nAnyway - this is really good stuff.

-- your explanation of the problem in JIRA is impeccable. I now I remember why \"just extending `SparkSerializer`\" was not an option. TinkerPop's Kryo is shaded. Your concept of a shim to abstract both shaded Kryo to be used by unshaded Kryo systems is smart. Looking at the code specifically, unfortunately, its hard to review and understand the full ramifications of what you are providing. I can run the integration test suite and all that, but perhaps you could also answer some questions as well. \n\n**Note that I haven't looked at this code in over 6 months so my questions may be a little odd sounding.**\n1. I never liked `HadoopPools`. I have a sneaking suspicion that they may not work with custom class registration and I we really should have a test case in there to prove yay or nay. Does your work either make `HadoopPools` \"better\" or no longer needed? (Also think about `GiraphGraphComputer` which uses `HadoopPools`).\n2. Moving forward, would people still use `GryoSerializer` or is it recommended that they use `SparkSerializer`? How would your work effect our docs and does `GryoSerializer` become deprecated?\n3. I noticed you moved around the serialization code for `StarGraph`. That is fine, but I'm wondering, did you change the serialization of `StarGraph`? That is, did the `byte[]` format change? If so, thats bad for backwards compatibility.\n\nFinally, your PR is beautiful. You JavaDoc like a king and you prove your worth as emperor with `package-info.java`. Thank you for your efforts in a part of the codebase that I wrote with a looming lack of confidence. You have brought a level of Java skill/technique to a long standing problem that is inspiring.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/223289046/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/223327112","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/324#issuecomment-223327112","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/324","id":223327112,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMzMyNzExMg==","user":{"login":"okram","id":148925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODkyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/148925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram","html_url":"https://github.com/okram","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-02T15:26:11Z","updated_at":"2016-06-02T15:26:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I

you had some really nice vision on this one. \n\nJust an organizational point - I feel like the \"kryoshim\" package should live inside of the \"gryo\" package as a child and not be a sibling. The `org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.structure.io` package should contain actual IO implementations (like gryo, graphson, graphml) and it seems to me that \"kryoshim\" only relates to \"gryo\". Make sense?\n\nYou didn't go so far as to deprecate anything and perhaps this work isn't quite at the point where we're ready to do that, but it would be nice to know what you see as the path to deprecating and removing some code (say `HadoopPools` and `GryoSerializers`) so that we could keep that knowledge around while it is fresh in your head. Perhaps we could polish all that up for the pending 3.2.1 release.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/223427944/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/223472360","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/325#issuecomment-223472360","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/325","id":223472360,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMzQ3MjM2MA==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-03T01:58:40Z","updated_at":"2016-06-03T01:58:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ran the integration tests and hit a failure after merging this branch onto the latest from master:\n\n``` text\nResults :\n\nTests in error: \n  GremlinResultSetIntegrateTest.shouldHandleVertexResultWithLiteSerialization:174 ?

I also dislike HadoopPools and would prefer to remove it, but I don't know how to do it correctly, even after considering the problem for a while.  Here are my open questions and observations.\n   \n   HadoopPools apparently exists to help Vertex/ObjectWritable implement Serializable.  They must implement Serializable because they keep showing up in `spark.closure.serializer`'s workload, and only JavaSerializer can be used as `spark.closure.serializer`.  A natural question here: is it reasonable and normal for graph types to appear in these closures in the first place?\n   \n   Spark has this nifty `spark.kryo.registrator` mechanism to support user-registered types with Kryo, and its docs talk at length about setting `spark.serializer`.   The docs read as though that was all the user would need to customize to deal with custom data.  `spark.closure.serializer` seems to barely be mentioned.  I've only seen it in the manual's exhaustive table of config options (http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/configuration.html).  Even then, the docs merely comment that JavaSerializer is its only supported value.  There's some old list traffic that says KryoSerializer is unsupported because, back when it was originally tested, it blew up on pretty much any Java closure, though that might have changed since.\n   \n   I wonder if this indicates some kind of usage antipattern.  Could there be an alternate approach to traversal/vertexprogram evaluation in SparkGraphComputer/SparkExecutor that avoids putting graph data into Spark closures?  That would make the use-case for HadoopPools disappear.  Then again, it seems so easy to get into this situation with `rdd.map(x -> whatever(x))`.  I am full of uncertainty on this point.  I don't have deep enough Spark knowledge to judge whether what we're doing now is reasonable.\n   \n   As long as Object/VertexWritable keep popping up in closures created by SparkGraphComputer & friends, we need some way to serialize them and everything they refer to, which can apparently involve a lot of graph entities.  We could theoretically implement Serializable \"manually\" (without Kryo/Gryo), but that seems like a massive amount of work, potentially inefficient, definitely redundant, and adds a huge new bug surface.  I'm against that approach, but that's about the only thing I know for certain here.\n2. In the long term, I think users should set\n   \n   ```\n   spark.serializer=KryoSerializer\n   spark.kryo.registrator=com.tinkerpop.something.TinkerPopRegistrator\n   ```\n   \n   and TinkerPop should stop registering/caring about Spark and scala-runtime types in its serialization layer.  This PR tries to keep GryoSerializer untouched though.  That migration doesn't have to be forced.\n   \n   I'm already using the `spark.kryo.registrator` setting in my app, where I have an impl that registers all TinkerPop types plus all of my app's types.  I can refactor that by extracting a TinkerPopRegistrator that covers the TP types (but not my app's).  I probably should have done that at the start.  As it stands, this PR is sort of a \"build-your-own-alternative-to-GryoSerializer\" kit, but the very last assembly steps involving a `spark.kryo.registrator` impl are left as an exercise to the user.  I'll try to introduce a TinkerPopRegistrator to address that, though I may reconsider if supporting custom type registration turns out way more complicated than I'm imagining.\n   \n   I think Gryo more generally is useful and can stay around indefinitely (say, for reading/writing data to the filesystem), but GryoSerializer should eventually stop being the recommended spark.serializer.  If that is all GryoSerializer per se exists to do, then it could be removed and any TinkerPop-specific class registrations that it performs moved to TinkerPopRegistrator.\n3.  This PR should maintain full format compatibility.  I deliberately tried to keep all of GryoMapper and GryoSerializer's class registrations, class IDs, and associated serializers (including StarGraphSerializer) functionally unchanged.  If you see somewhere that I unintentionally changed the format, that's a bug.\n\n@spmallette:\n\nre. package organization: definitely makes sense, I'll move kryoshim under io.gryo.  Please let me know if I bungled the package hierarchy anywhere else.\n\nre. path forward: I think 1 and 2 above touch on both HadoopPools and GryoSerializer.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/223484723/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/223485790","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/314#issuecomment-223485790","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/314","id":223485790,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMzQ4NTc5MA==","user":{"login":"lewismc","id":1165719,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjU3MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1165719?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc","html_url":"https://github.com/lewismc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-03T04:03:33Z","updated_at":"2016-06-03T04:33:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Commits squashed sorry about that folks.

I attempted to resolve those conflicts too hastily and got it wrong.\n\nI went back to Stephen's original commit and reworked my code around registration overrides.  I now think it conforms to the old behavior precedent.  Specifically, when handling overrides of GryoMapper type registrations, I departed from the precedent set by Stephen's commit in two ways, both of which I've fixed locally:\n- Override registrations allocated a new registration ID.  Your commit used the old ID from the registration being overridden.\n- As a side effect of the preceding point, I incremented the shared `currentSerializationId` for all registration calls.  Your commit incremented this shared counter only for non-override registration calls.\n\nThe test passes locally for me now.  I'm still doing some registrator refactoring and haven't pushed.\n\n@okram The problem with custom registrations is that GryoMapper allows the user to provide a serializer written against shaded Kryo.  This is not compatible with Spark's KryoSerializer.  I don't see a way to make it compatible without putting fake `org.apache.tinkerpop.shaded.kryo.*` classes on the classpath, which could get pretty ugly.\n\nInstead, I'm adding a registrator that includes:\n- all default mappings from GryoMapper (I am changing the shaded-Kryo-serializers to be shim serializers so that they are reusable)\n- the TinkerPop classes registered in GryoSerializer's constructors (but not the scala and Spark classes registered in there)\n\nIf the user wants to register custom types while using KryoSerializer, they can extend the registrator in a subclass, then set `spark.kryo.registrator` to the subclass.  The interface in question is `KryoRegistrator` and it has only one method, `registerClasses(Kryo)`.  It's about as simple -- maybe even more so -- than implementing TP's `IoRegistry` interface, which has two methods.\n\nIf the user decides to continue using GryoSerializer, they can also continue using `GryoPool.CONFIG_IO_REGISTRY`, which should still affect GryoSerializer/HadoopPools as it always has.\n\nWDYT?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/223571336/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/223618729","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/327#issuecomment-223618729","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/327","id":223618729,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMzYxODcyOQ==","user":{"login":"dkuppitz","id":572377,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjM3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/572377?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz","html_url":"https://github.com/dkuppitz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-03T15:57:35Z","updated_at":"2016-06-03T15:57:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"VOTE: +1\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/223618729/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/223623533","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/327#issuecomment-223623533","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/327","id":223623533,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMzYyMzUzMw==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-03T16:15:47Z","updated_at":"2016-06-03T16:15:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"VOTE +1 -

I will attempt to subclass KryoSerializer so that I can access the SparkConf passed to its constructior and check for `GryoPool.CONFIG_IO_REGISTRY` (similar to what GryoSerializer does now), then apply any registrations found therein so long as each registration either:\n   - specifies no explicit serializer (using Kryo's internal default) or\n   - specifies a shim serializer\n   \n   In particular, if the registry contains an old-style TP shaded Kryo serializer that hasn't been ported to the shim, then the KryoSerializer subclass will throw an exception.\n   \n   This change is necessary to support custom-serialized, `IoRegistry`-listed datatypes that appear in most Spark data outside of closures (say, in the RDD itself).\n2. I will replace current callsites of `HadoopPools.initialize(conf)` with some other static method that calls `HadoopPools.initialize(conf)` and then calls some roughly equivalent `initialize(conf)`

just pushed some changes that I hacked together this weekend.  The key additions are:\n- `TinkerPopKryoRegistrator`, which I extracted from my app, and which acts as a `spark.kryo.registrator` impl that knows about TinkerPop types\n- `IoRegistryAwareKryoSerializer`, which is a Spark `Serializer` that looks for `GryoPool.CONFIG_IO_REGISTRY` and applies it if present\n- `KryoShimLoaderService.applyConfiguration(cfg)`, which replaces direct calls to `HadoopPools.initialize(cfg)` and adds equivalent functionality for initializing the unshaded Kryo serializer pool\n\nThe user would theoretically just set\n\n```\nspark.serializer=org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.spark.structure.io.gryo.IoRegistryAwareKryoSerializer\nspark.kryo.registrator=org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.spark.structure.io.gryo.TinkerPopKryoRegistrator\n# Optional, only needed for custom types\ngremlin.io.registry=whatever.user.IoRegistryImpl\n```\n\nIn practice, when I have a custom gremlin.io.registry, I have always had to take the additional step (long before this PR) of forcibly initializing `HadoopPools` before touching SparkGraphComputer in my app, or else some part of Spark -- I think the closure serializer -- would attempt to use HadooPools via ObjectWritable/VertexWritable before initialization and produce garbage on my custom classes.  **This problem predates my PR**. I'm not trying to solve it here, in part because I still don't know if it's a pathology specific to my app or because TinkerPop is missing a crucial `HadoopPools.initialize` (now, equivalently, `KryoShimLoaderService.applyConfiguration`) call somewhere, and in part because HadoopPools is such a hideous architectural wart that the ultimate solution probably involves destroying it.\n\nIn the past, I've worked around this by defining a custom spark.serializer that delegates newKryo() to a GryoSerializer/IoRegistryAwareSerializer, but which has a constructor that invokes `HadoopPools.initialize`/`KryoShimLoaderService.applyConfiguration` (relying on that method's idempotence).\n\nAgain, this initialization step just be specific to my app and unnecessary for the average TinkerPop user.

This branch is my PR plus additional tweaks Marko and I worked out on top.  His branch supersedes this PR branch now.  This PR branch **should not be merged because Marko's branch subsumes/extends it**.\n- I have a rough idea of what changed as we discussed code on the hangout, but I will go through his branch's new commits and review.\n- The new serialization code is lower-priority than the old code.  It has to be turned on through explicit user action, like this is the test provider code:\n\n```\n            System.setProperty(SHIM_CLASS_SYSTEM_PROPERTY, UnshadedKryoShimService.class.getCanonicalName());\n            config.put(\"spark.serializer\", KryoSerializer.class.getCanonicalName());\n            config.put(\"spark.kryo.registrator\", GryoRegistrator.class.getCanonicalName());\n```\n- Marko setup SparkHadoopGraphProvider to randomly choose either the old serialization code or the new stuff in https://github.com/apache/incubator-tinkerpop/commit/e7003635e27c625b3f30492111f20f4fe4e24eb5#diff-afffc6796745845d46e6f60ea3a992f9R91.  IMHO that should be overrideable to make it deterministic, but it's not a huge deal since it's limited to test code.\n- We replaced `GryoClassResolver` with a series of class registrations in https://github.com/apache/incubator-tinkerpop/commit/e7003635e27c625b3f30492111f20f4fe4e24eb5#diff-2e881d0a6ab7ed1ca7d1f593bceadfd2R207.  I intended to punt on this because its key feature, automatic detachment, wasn't necessary for my immediate use cases and because the new serialization code was not going to be turned on by default, Marko (fairly) refused to accept such half measures.\n  \n  The idea behind this change is to explicitly configure which types need a detaching serializer rather than relying on `GryoClassResolver` to automagically do it regardless of explicit class registrations.  Three factors influence this choice:\n  - Spark's KryoSerializer does not support a user-provided ClassResolver, and working around that limitation entails either getting a change through Spark upstream or copying and pasting a bunch of KryoSerializer's private/hardcoded class registrations, some of which could change in future Spark versions.  The latter is ugly and would make the code brittle across Spark upgrades.\n  - `GryoClassResolver` is convenient but somewhat mysterious to third parties, who are likelier to have seen a custom class registration mechanism (like TP's `IoRegistry` or Spark's `spark.kryo.registrator`) than a custom resolver.  It also removes vendor control in that its detachment behavior is not configurable, so modifying it requires subclassing or reimplementation. For instance, if a vendor had a lightweight Vertex implementation with a custom serializer and wanted to bypass TP's resolver-driven detachment, then I don't think it would be possible without modifying TP's resolver.\n  - `GryoClassResolver` is written against a bunch of shaded types and relies on `readVarInt`/`writeVarInt`, which were added in Kryo 2.22, one version too late for compatibility with Spark's Kryo 2.21.  This is the least important concern of the three, more an implementation detail.\n- Marko is running the full integration test suite now.  He ran the spark ITs just before pushing and reported success on those specifically.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/224093824/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/224095110","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/325#issuecomment-224095110","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/325","id":224095110,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNDA5NTExMA==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-06T21:32:40Z","updated_at":"2016-06-06T21:32:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Marko setup SparkHadoopGraphProvider to randomly choose either the old serialization code or the new stuff in e700363#diff-afffc6796745845d46e6f60ea3a992f9R91.
