In this function, a check should be performed to see if a UUID-parsable configuration property already exists before generating a random UUID. I think this is enough to add configurable framework UUID support. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, I suggest updating the original property name from \"org.osgi.framework.uuid\" to something like \"CELIX_FRAMEWORK_CONFIGURED_UUID,\" as Celix configuration properties, today, typically follow a naming scheme more aligned with shell environment variables.\r\n\r\nNote that configurable framework UUIDs were likely supported in the past and may have been removed accidentally.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/comments/2212521006/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/comments/2212524314","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/celix/issues/754#issuecomment-2212524314","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/754","id":2212524314,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVuczs6D4HEa","user":{"login":"pnoltes","id":1766397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NjYzOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1766397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes","html_url":"https://github.com/pnoltes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-07T18:01:03Z","updated_at":"2024-07-07T18:01:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I am not sure if we can configure coverity to cope with `__attribute__((cleanup(func)))`. \r\n\r\nThere is some option for a model reference, see: https://scan.coverity.com/tune\r\nBut as far as I can tell this does not help, because coverity does not register that then `func` is called once a variable goes out of scope. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/comments/2212524314/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/comments/2221882196","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/celix/pull/760#issuecomment-2221882196","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/760","id":2221882196,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVuczs6EbztU","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-11T02:44:16Z","updated_at":"2024-07-11T02:44:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## [Codecov](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/celix/pull/760?dropdown=coverage&src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=apache) Report\nAll modified and coverable lines are covered by tests :white_check_mark:\n> Project coverage is 90.31%.

Then you should use the service on demand pattern. For an example, check the implementation of logger helper.\r\n\r\n> In this scenario, I can only add the interface header file and consumer file of the server bundle to the consumer bundle on the lower computer to achieve startup registration. \r\n\r\nDynamic bundle loading has nothing to do with interface header file, which is only relevant at build time (say, when building the bundle). Dynamic loading is a deployment issue, not a build time issue. Whenever a bundle is received from the remote side, all you have to do is to install and start the bundle.\r\n\r\n>  Additionally, due to the limitation on requirement 1\r\n\r\nAs already answered, I saw no limitation here.\r\n\r\nFor user help, please use the mailing list.

For C++ std::future could be used and the OSGi spec has also something for this [OSGi Promise](https://docs.osgi.org/specification/osgi.cmpn/8.1.0/util.promise.html). ASF Celix also has a implementation for [Promises](https://github.com/apache/celix/tree/rel/celix-2.4.0/libs/promises), but only for C++.\r\n\r\nLet assume there was also C implementation for this. The instead of a callback the provide api could look something like:\r\n```\r\n//provider api\r\n#include <celix_promise.h>\r\n\r\n#define MY_SERVICE_NAME \"my_service\"\r\n#define MY_SERVICE_VERSION \"1.0.0\"\r\n\r\ntypedef struct my_service {\r\n    void* handle;\r\n    celix_promise_t (*doSomething)(void *handle, const char *input, const char *callbackServiceUUID);\r\n```\r\n\r\nMaybe with promise api like:\r\n```\r\n//celix_promise_factory.h\r\n\r\ncelix_deferred_t celix_promiseFactory_deferred(celix_promise_factory_t* fac);\r\n\r\n//celix_promise.h\r\n\r\ncelix_promise_onSuccess(celix_promise_t promise, void* data, void (*done)(void* data, void* result));\r\n\r\n//celix_deferred.h\r\ncelix_promise_t celix_deferred_getPromise(celix_deferred_t deferred);\r\nvoid celix_deferred_resolvePromise(celix_deferred_t deferred, void* result);\r\nvoid celix_deferred_fail(celix_deferred_t deferred, int error, const char* errorMsg);\r\n```\r\nAnd a separate promise api for a `long`, `double`, `boolean,` void`, and `array_list`  promise.\r\n\r\nThe provider could do something like:\r\n```\r\ncelix_promise_t my_service_doSomething(void *handle, const char *input, const char *callbackServiceUUID) {\r\n    provider_t *provider = handle;\r\n\r\n    celix_deferred_t def = celix_promiseFactory_deferred(provider->factory);\r\n    provider->queueAsyncProcessing(def);\r\n    return celix_deferred_getPromise(def);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the consumer snippet:\r\n```\r\nvoid useServiceCallback(void* data, void* result) {\r\n   consumer_t *consumer = handle;\r\n   //handle real result.\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid useService(void *handle, void *svc) {\r\n   consumer_t *consumer = handle;\r\n   celix_promise_t promise =  service->doSomething(service->handle, \"input\", \"<frameworkUUID>+<service id>\");\r\n   celix_arrayList_add(consumer->activePromises, promise);\r\n   celix_promise_onSuccess(promise, consumer, useServiceCallback);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis also means that the provider is not aware how the consumer will handle the (async) result. \r\n\r\nImportant concept would be that both the provided and consumer can drop the promise/deferred and it should clean itself up. \r\n\r\nBut maybe something already exists for this. Because although I like the Promise concept, I am not sure if we need a C implementation for this. \r\n\r\nAlso this concept then needs to be directly supported in remote services (first class citizen) so that the remote service admins can generated endpoint/proxies that can handle promise and deferred objects. For Java this is also mentioned in the remote service admin spec: https://docs.osgi.org/specification/osgi.cmpn/8.1.0/service.remoteservices.html#d0e1444\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/comments/2429951856/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/comments/2431587844","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/celix/issues/684#issuecomment-2431587844","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/684","id":2431587844,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVuczs6Q7xYE","user":{"login":"PengZheng","id":5362947,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjI5NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5362947?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng","html_url":"https://github.com/PengZheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-23T10:02:00Z","updated_at":"2024-10-23T10:02:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'll add bundle startup time, which is useful for fast startup optimization.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/comments/2431587844/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/comments/2466753312","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/celix/pull/773#issuecomment-2466753312","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/773","id":2466753312,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVuczs6TB6sg","user":{"login":"pnoltes","id":1766397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NjYzOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1766397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes","html_url":"https://github.com/pnoltes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-10T14:15:36Z","updated_at":"2024-11-10T14:15:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@xuzhenbao Thanks for the PR.
