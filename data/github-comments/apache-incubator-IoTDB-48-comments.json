If you'd rather skip all updates until the next major or minor version, let me know by commenting `@dependabot ignore this major version` or `@dependabot ignore this minor version`. You can also ignore all major, minor, or patch releases for a dependency by adding an [`ignore` condition](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/configuration-options-for-dependency-updates#ignore) with the desired `update_types` to your config file.\n\nIf you change your mind, just re-open this PR and I'll resolve any conflicts on it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/952476904/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/952504612","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iotdb/pull/4079#issuecomment-952504612","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/4079","id":952504612,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCXnElM44xhEk","user":{"login":"chengjianyun","id":6150814,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxNTA4MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6150814?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengjianyun","html_url":"https://github.com/chengjianyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengjianyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengjianyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengjianyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengjianyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengjianyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengjianyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengjianyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengjianyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengjianyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-27T03:25:09Z","updated_at":"2021-10-27T03:25:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"# Performance Test\r\n## Environment \r\n3 nodes, 3 replica, multi-factor=1\r\n\r\n## benchmark config: \r\n> CLIENT_NUMBER=20\r\n> GROUP_NUMBER=20\r\n> DEVICE_NUMBER=100000\r\n> SENSOR_NUMBER=10\r\n> BATCH_SIZE=100\r\n> LOOP=100\r\n\r\n\r\n## cluster- branch\r\ncommit id: 6541b80\r\n### write \r\n![cluster-write-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6150814/138994315-7b1b676d-3656-458e-81d2-2be81a90baf7.jpg)\r\n\r\n### query\r\n![cluster-read-2-1-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6150814/138994743-64a69f02-acc8-434e-90fa-da95c4e94329.jpg)\r\n\r\n### master branch\r\ncommit id: 87e1ae4\r\n### write\r\n![master-write](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6150814/138994534-cf5f8ab3-4d7c-468c-9fde-7e020969a19c.jpg)\r\n\r\n### query\r\n![master-read](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6150814/138994478-d9cb5484-2055-4c9d-8192-8ba163d37e42.jpg)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/952504612/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/952567799","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iotdb/pull/4079#issuecomment-952567799","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/4079","id":952567799,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCXnElM44xwf3","user":{"login":"jixuan1989","id":1021782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjE3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1021782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jixuan1989","html_url":"https://github.com/jixuan1989","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jixuan1989/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jixuan1989/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jixuan1989/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jixuan1989/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jixuan1989/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jixuan1989/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jixuan1989/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jixuan1989/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jixuan1989/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-27T06:05:11Z","updated_at":"2021-10-27T06:05:11Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I see both the write and query have a better performance. \r\nCould we have some analysis about the reason?

For query, double confirmed that the test and environment configs are same and run benchmark on master twice with the same result.
