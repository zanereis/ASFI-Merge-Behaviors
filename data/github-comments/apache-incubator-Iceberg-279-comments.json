Thanks for raising this PR, and sorry for the long wait. As you mentioned in the PR description, this operation should be able to be done in a single commit. I dug into it, and I was able to let the test pass (thank you for writing those!) with the following change:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  private Integer findForMove(String name) {\r\n    Types.NestedField field = findField(name);\r\n    if (field != null) {\r\n      return field.fieldId();\r\n    }\r\n    return addedNameToId.get(name);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo:\r\n```java\r\n  private Integer findForMove(String name) {\r\n    Integer addedId = addedNameToId.get(name);\r\n    if (addedId != null) {\r\n      return addedId;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    Types.NestedField field = findField(name);\r\n    if (field != null) {\r\n      return field.fieldId();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return null;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis way we keep all the logic of moving fields in the same place.

Based on the code I do not see any obvious issues, but it might worth to check the performance implications of this change?\r\n> \r\n> @pvary there is no change in the logic. simple refactor with a common base class extracted. so I don't expect performance implications\r\n\r\nPrevious code had 1 less redirection/inheritance. Optimized loops can be a thing in this type of code paths, where the compiler could deduce that the different iterations of the loops are independent, and could be executed in batch. Adding more redirection/inheritance could break the optimization algorithm and instead of a parallel loop we can end up executing the loop sequentially. This could cause performance degradation. This is the only effect which might effect other users of the classes touched by this change, otherwise I think the change keeps the old behaviour correctly and introduces a new one, which we need.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1727119135/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1727134490","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/7837#issuecomment-1727134490","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/7837","id":1727134490,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85m8fsa","user":{"login":"jbonofre","id":158903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODkwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/158903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre","html_url":"https://github.com/jbonofre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-20T07:33:56Z","updated_at":"2023-09-20T07:33:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@aokolnychyi Hey Anton.
