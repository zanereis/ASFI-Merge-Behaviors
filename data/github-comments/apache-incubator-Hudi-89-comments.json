Normal Queries will not be reading data from older versions of the file. So, from data perspective, there is no overhead.\r\n\r\nKeeping tons of versions though could potentially slow down the query as the file listing might take a long time. In terms of metadata memory,  the default implementation retains file metadata (of all versions) in memory. So, you will see a corresponding increase although I expect it to scale with number of files * versions. But, Hudi also supports other file metadata stores (using rocks-db : hoodie.filesystem.view.type=EMBEDDED_KV_STORE and hoodie.embed.timeline.server=true) if the default setup does not scale for you.

\r\nA. Thanks  so much. This pr need to solved the issue with better approach. \r\nNow I am more clear about overwrite semantic between table.overwrite and  spark sql overwrite for hudi.\r\n\r\nB. Also spark sql for hudi overwrite should have the ability just like spark sql 、hive 、 delta lake.\r\nthese engine have three mode for overwrite about partition:\r\n1. Dynamic Partition : delete all partition data ,and the insert the new data for different \r\n2. Static partition: just overwrite the partition which is user specified\r\n3.

I believe this property tells Hudi when to perform compaction based on number of commits. The issue here is you may have tables that are rarely updated. If INLINE_COMPACT_NUM_DELTA_COMMITS_PROP is set to 10, and it takes 1 month for a table to collect 10 commits, then the delay time would be 1 month.\r\n\r\nWhat do you suggest is the best approach to perform compaction based on TIME rather than number of commits?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/722564973/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/722567592","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/2230#issuecomment-722567592","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/2230","id":722567592,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyMjU2NzU5Mg==","user":{"login":"bvaradar","id":3021376,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMjEzNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3021376?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar","html_url":"https://github.com/bvaradar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-05T18:44:37Z","updated_at":"2020-11-05T18:44:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@n3nash @prashantwason : Can you take a look at this.

Why do you want to wait for 30 days before running compaction ? Do you mean cleaning the old versions 30 days back ?\r\n\r\n\r\nHello. I was just giving an example of one of my concerns with the number of commits to trigger compaction approach.\r\n\r\nHere is my scenario:\r\n1) Spark structured stream queries Kinesis.\r\n2) Spark processed a batch\r\n3) Batch contains data from table X, Y, Z. My foreachBatch logic will group these records by table and Hudi will run 3 times using foreach table loop where Hudi will process each table sequentially. Hudi has INLINE_COMPACT_NUM_DELTA_COMMITS_PROP set to 10.\r\n4) Next 9 batches have data for table X and Y, but none of these batches contain data for table Z \r\n\r\nDoes this mean compaction will run for Table X and Y to compact data from batch 1 to 10, and Table Z will not be compact?\r\n\r\nIf there's a way to compact based on time, then we can set the time to every 10 minutes and that would mean cold tables would be compacted too.\r\n\r\nIt seems INLINE_COMPACT_NUM_DELTA_COMMITS_PROP will trigger compaction often on hot tables, but may not trigger for cold tables. My concern with cold tables is that it's possible it can take days or weeks before enough changes/commits come in to trigger compaction.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/722808651/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/722937587","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/2196#issuecomment-722937587","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/2196","id":722937587,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyMjkzNzU4Nw==","user":{"login":"satishkotha","id":2992755,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTI3NTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2992755?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishkotha","html_url":"https://github.com/satishkotha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishkotha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishkotha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishkotha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishkotha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishkotha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishkotha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishkotha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishkotha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishkotha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-06T08:02:31Z","updated_at":"2020-11-06T08:02:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> @satishkotha\r\n> A. Thanks so much. This pr need to solved the issue with better approach.\r\n> Now I am more clear about overwrite semantic between table.overwrite and spark sql overwrite for hudi.\r\n> \r\n> B. Also spark sql for hudi overwrite should have the ability just like spark sql 、hive 、 delta lake.\r\n> these engine have three mode for overwrite about partition:\r\n> \r\n> 1. Dynamic Partition : delete all partition data ,and the insert the new data for different\r\n> 2. Static partition: just overwrite the partition which is user specified\r\n> 3. Mixed partition: mixed of 1 and 2\r\n>    more detail in :\r\n>    https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.0.0-preview/sql-ref-syntax-dml-insert-overwrite-table.html\r\n>    https://www.programmersought.com/article/47155360487/\r\n> \r\n> C. our plan\r\n> \r\n> 1.
