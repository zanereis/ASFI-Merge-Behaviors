I think we should still change how the `ExecutorService` is instantiated. Instead of doing it in the constructor it should happen imo outside of the component.

for opening this PR @TisonKun. \r\n\r\nBefore diving into the details of this PR I'd like to know whether you've observed that the JM crashes or is this more of theoretical nature? If it does crash indeed, then I would be interested to learn why, because the `requestPartitionState` method should not be blocking at all. How many `requestPartitionState` messages are in generated in the crash case?\r\n\r\nAnother question is concerning your assumptions: You said that `retriggerPartitionRequest` would fail if the producer is gone. With producer do you mean the producing `Task` or the `TaskManager`. In the former case, I think the remote `TaskManager` would simply respond with a `PartitionNotFoundException` which retriggers the same partition request method again. Thus, I'm not quite sure whether the consumer task would actually fail or simply retry infinitely. The latter result is imo what we try to prevent with asking the JM about the state of the result partition.\r\n\r\nI would like to hear @uce opinion on this as well, because he used to work on this part of the code in the past.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/426950862/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/426998950","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6785#issuecomment-426998950","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6785","id":426998950,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNjk5ODk1MA==","user":{"login":"GJL","id":1681921,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODE5MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1681921?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJL","html_url":"https://github.com/GJL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-04T12:25:30Z","updated_at":"2018-10-04T12:25:30Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"There

However, I wonder what sort of corruption you have in mind that is fixed here. Can you provide a concrete example of a problematic case? In my understanding, graph components are either connected and need a connected restart or they are independent and can recover fine-grained but then then it should also not matter in which order splits are reprocessed.\r\n\r\nBesides that, I wonder if the general approach is a good fit for the current and future architecture of this component. In particular, we pull the concern of `InputSplit` down to the level of `Executions`. `Execution` or `ExecutionJobVertex` are used in batch and streaming and to me it does not seem like a good step to introduce batch-specific code into those classes if we can avoid it. Another thing that I question here is if it would not make sense to think about a way that allows us also to release the assignment from an input split to a certain task, so that another task can pick it up in case that there is a longer lasting problem with the original task. Last, we are currently thinking about a general redesign of the source interface and how input is assigned to the source instances. @aljoscha has a WIP branch to experiment with the possible changes here https://github.com/aljoscha/flink/tree/refactor-source-interface, but we should keep in mind that sources might be split into two operators in the future.

Maybe an alternative approach could be to have a fixed set of `TaskException`s for the cases, and before leaving the TM, all exceptions are wrapped as cause into their matching `TaskException`  to classify them for the JM's recovery approach.

The input data is empty so that the tasks finishes soon after started.\r\n\r\nIn this case JM shows slow RPC responses and TM/RM heartbeats to JM will finally timeout. Digging out the reason, there are ~2,000,000 `requestPartitionState` messages triggered by `triggerPartitionProducerStateCheck` in a short time, which overwhelms JM RPC main thread. This is due to downstream tasks can be started earlier than upstream tasks in EAGER scheduling.\r\n\r\nFor you second question, the task can just keep waiting for a while and retrying if the partition does not exist. There are two cases when the partition does not exist: 1. the partition is not started yet 2. the partition is failed. In case 1, retry works. In case 2, a task failover will soon happen and cancel the downstream tasks as

a lot for the detailed reviews and discussions, @dawidwys and @StephanEwen.\r\n\r\n@dawidwys and I went through some offline second-pass discussions on the suggestions, and we finally came up with this (implemented in the follow-up e2cbe99):\r\n\r\n1. To incorporate all the desired changes to the current `TypeSerializerConfigSnapshot` class (e.g. not explicitly setting the classloader, dump using the `VersionedIOReadableWritable` as base class, etc.), we came up with introducing `TypeSerializerSnapshot` which will eventually be the new snapshot interface once we completely remove `TypeSerializerConfigSnapshot`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@PublicEvolving\r\npublic interface TypeSerializerSnapshot<T> {\r\n    int getCurrentVersion();\r\n    void write(DataOutputView out) throws IOException;\r\n    void read(int readVersion, DataInputView in, ClassLoader userCodeClassLoader) throws IOException;\r\n    TypeSerializer<T> restoreSerializer();\r\n    <NS extends TypeSerializer<T>> TypeSerializerSchemaCompatibility<T, NS> resolveSchemaCompatibility(NS newSerializer);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf a serializer's snapshot is still the legacy `TypeSerializerConfigSnapshot`, then the prior serializer will always be written along with it so that the dummy `restoreSerializer()` factory method works with requiring the user for any changes. Once the user upgrades to directly implementing the `TypeSerializerSnapshot`, then the `restoreSerializer()` method will be strictly required to be implemented, and the prior serializer will no longer be written anymore.\r\n\r\nIt is only possible to change a snapshot from `TypeSerializerConfigSnapshot` to `TypeSerializerSnapshot`, and not the other way around.\r\n\r\nThis allows us to incrementally upgrade each serializer snapshot class currently in Flink.\r\nWe can still release if only partially some of the serializers have been upgraded.\r\n\r\n2. The `BackwardsCompatibleConfigSnapshot` wrapper class is still required, so that for Flink version <= 1.2 (which only wrote the serializer instance and no snapshots), we can wrap the serializer instance inside a snapshot implementation.\r\n\r\nOverall, the new changes quite closely follows your suggestions, only with a different approach to how the new / old interfaces work together.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/427744344/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/427747927","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6755#issuecomment-427747927","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6755","id":427747927,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNzc0NzkyNw==","user":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-08T07:54:06Z","updated_at":"2018-10-08T07:54:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I took a look at the different sizes of a serialized `AbstractID` with and without the transient keyword:\r\n\r\n* old `AbstractID`: 126 bytes\r\n* old `AbstractID` with `toString` being called before serialization: 160 bytes\r\n* transient `AbstractID`: 93 bytes\r\n\r\nThe issue has been created because ZhuZhu observed scalability issues when deploying very large jobs.

Maybe we could solve it a bit differently, by deploying tasks in topological order when using the `EAGER` scheduling.\r\n\r\nConcerning your answer to my second question: What if the producer partition would get disposed (e.g. due to a failover which does not necessarily restart the downstream operators). At the moment an upstream task failure will always fail the downstream consumers. However, this can change in the future and the more assumptions (e.g. downstream operators will be failed if upstream operators fail) we bake in, the harder it gets to change this behaviour. Moreover, I think it is always a good idea, to make the components as self-contained as possible. This also entails that the failover behaviour should ideally not depend on other things to happen. Therefore, I'm a bit hesitant to change the existing behaviour.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/427783408/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/427786350","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6759#issuecomment-427786350","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6759","id":427786350,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNzc4NjM1MA==","user":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-08T10:29:45Z","updated_at":"2018-10-08T10:29:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for updating this PR @Clarkkkkk.

From what I see, `KeyGroupRangeAssignment#assignToKeyGroup` is utility class. It has 36 usages in different classes: state backends, operators, and tests. `AbstractKeyedStateBackend#setCurrentKey`, which uses the utilty method has 296 usages.\r\n\r\nI'm bit afraid that catching and testing NPE earlier in the chain requires a significant effort to rewrite everything without much benefit. As try/catch doesn't make code cleaner and adding the same error message will violate DRY principle. \r\n\r\nAlso, determine if the key is null earlier in the chain without preconditions with try/catch might lead to false positives as there's another reason for child method throwing NPE.\r\n\r\nFrom what I see `computeKeyGroupForKeyHash(key.hashCode(), maxParallelism);` is the place where key group index calcluated and NPE is thrown in case key is null.

It means that `JobMaster` or `ExecutionGraphBuilder` should decide how to fail. We also have to make that checkpointing in Task Executor does not fail the job anymore, only the `CheckpointFailureManager` as a central point of failure.\r\n\r\nAnother point is that inserting failure callback into different places in `CheckpointCoordinator` close to cause looks rather invasive. Ideally, there should be 2 places where `CheckpointFailureManager` should get callback:\r\n- in `triggerCheckpoint(long timestamp, boolean isPeriodic)` checking `CheckpointTriggerResult` (sync part)\r\n- similar to `PendingCheckpointStats` getting callback in `PendingCheckpoint.reportFailedCheckpoint` (async part) but with clear defined cause like `CheckpointDeclineReason` for sync part.\r\n\r\n`PendingCheckpoint` does not have such clearly defined failure handling as `triggerCheckpoint` and might need some refactoring to distinguish failure cases. \r\n\r\nI suggest we firstly describe the full approach in Jira issue where we also include a list of all possible failures which `CheckpointFailureManager` needs to react upon and how we define them in code. It can be also a link to some design doc.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/428137039/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/428144132","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6783#issuecomment-428144132","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6783","id":428144132,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyODE0NDEzMg==","user":{"login":"aai95","id":42375035,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMzc1MDM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42375035?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aai95","html_url":"https://github.com/aai95","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aai95/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aai95/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aai95/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aai95/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aai95/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aai95/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aai95/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aai95/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aai95/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-09T10:37:37Z","updated_at":"2018-10-09T10:37:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@Guibo-Pan thank you for your suggestion.\r\nThe idea about adding the \"Nth root\" function sounds good to me.\r\nIt will be analog of existing `POWER(x, y) = x ^ y`, but can be more useful in SQL like `ROOT(125, 3)` will produce 5, instead of `POWER(125, 1.0 / 3.0)`.\r\nMore pleasent syntax, I can rename this issue and rewrite implementation based on idea that `root(x, y) = power(x, 1 / y)`.\r\nWhat do you think about it?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/428144132/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/428148803","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6700#issuecomment-428148803","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6700","id":428148803,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyODE0ODgwMw==","user":{"login":"pnowojski","id":8957547,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NTc1NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8957547?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski","html_url":"https://github.com/pnowojski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-09T10:55:43Z","updated_at":"2018-10-09T10:55:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the contribution @yanghua, merged.
