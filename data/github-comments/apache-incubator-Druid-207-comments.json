I think it's good enough for starting support for join queries. I think there's no rush for making PR(s). \r\n\r\nI wonder https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/issues/4040 is the proposal of this issue. Whether it is or not, I strongly recommend to write a new proposal (or improve the existing one) for your idea, so that others can review its design first. (I guess the design and implementation might have been changed or new stuffs have been added since https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/issues/4040 was written.) This is because this kind of work should be tagged with `Design Review` and get +1s from 3 different committers. The design review would also involve the review on the design of your implementation. According to the review comments, you may need to change some design decisions. This is always easier to do before fully writing your codes. So, it would be better as the proposal shows details. Please check other proposals like https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/issues/6319 or https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/issues/4349.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/433659787/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/433720229","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/6052#issuecomment-433720229","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6052","id":433720229,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMzcyMDIyOQ==","user":{"login":"dongjinleekr","id":2375128,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNzUxMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2375128?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjinleekr","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjinleekr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjinleekr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjinleekr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjinleekr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjinleekr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjinleekr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjinleekr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjinleekr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjinleekr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjinleekr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-28T16:27:07Z","updated_at":"2018-10-28T16:27:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Sorry for late response.
