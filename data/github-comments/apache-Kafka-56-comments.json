While we really should just insert the security config via templating, since we seem to already be manually stringifying and concatenating in a bunch of tests I simply added the newline characters back in and have validated locally that the Connect security tests continue to pass and a MM test with security enabled also passes.\n\nI also reduced the test to only do `PLAINTEXT` and `SASL_SSL` as @ijuma suggested. I think it's better to avoid a ton of extra variants here since we don't expect any difference between the different modes, we just care that the options are actually passed properly to producers/consumers.\n\nI kicked off a new test build here:

Besides comment left inline, I think you can remove the dependency on `connect:json` in `build.gradle:712` since that was only there for serializers as far as I can tell.\n\nRest of the code looks

You could also avoid the code duplication between clients and connect by just moving all the code and leaving the connect version inheriting from the clients class (but still marked deprecated), but this code is small and simple enough that I am not particularly concerned about that.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/206047406/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/206086285","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1191#issuecomment-206086285","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1191","id":206086285,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNjA4NjI4NQ==","user":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-06T02:25:07Z","updated_at":"2016-04-06T02:25:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Discussed with @ewencp offline, and we decided to postpone this movement until we break `kafka-clients` into separate jars.\n\nAnd I'm assuming @ijuma will drive the split :100: \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/206086285/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/206286148","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1144#issuecomment-206286148","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1144","id":206286148,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNjI4NjE0OA==","user":{"login":"oscerd","id":5106647,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMDY2NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5106647?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oscerd","html_url":"https://github.com/oscerd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oscerd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oscerd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oscerd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oscerd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oscerd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oscerd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oscerd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oscerd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oscerd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-06T10:11:23Z","updated_at":"2016-04-06T10:11:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Any news on this PR?

I have not implemented the 'forward' flag as documented on the KIP. The purpose of the flag was to detect when a request loop had been encountered in the restart forwarding. I discussed the problem with @Ishiihara and we feel this scenario is unlikely to be a problem in practice since it requires consecutive rebalances at a very quick rate. We can imagine a request getting \"unlucky\" once if a rebalance is triggered just after forwarding, but it's hard to imagine multiple times. And if we are not concerned about the degenerate case, then this actually gives the request some fault tolerance since we would otherwise have to surface the routing failure to the user. On the other hand, if we think this is a serious problem, then it would make more sense to have a general solution which can also be applied to requests which are only forwarded to the leader.\n2. The KIP documented returning 409 when there is a conflicting operation in progress (such as another restart or a rebalance). This is actually trickier than it sounds since the rebalance is hidden inside WorkerCoordinator.poll(). We could set a flag in the revocation callback to indicate that the rebalance has begun, but the rebalance might begin immediately after checking it, so there would be no guarantee that the restart _didn't_ get stuck behind a rebalance. For a restart, we would need to track some additional state for each task and we would need the ability to inspect the request queue in `DistributedHerder` to see if there were any pending restarts for the same task. This is doable, but the cost feels quite high for a questionable capability since the only impact of not having it is that concurrent restart requests may cause unneeded restarts. However, if restarting is expensive for some connectors, maybe it does have some value.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/207113093/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/207125013","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1183#issuecomment-207125013","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1183","id":207125013,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNzEyNTAxMw==","user":{"login":"ewencp","id":47366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp","html_url":"https://github.com/ewencp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-07T22:49:00Z","updated_at":"2016-04-07T22:49:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM, thanks @rajinisivaram!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/207125013/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/207127453","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1192#issuecomment-207127453","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1192","id":207127453,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNzEyNzQ1Mw==","user":{"login":"apovzner","id":5383840,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzODM4NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5383840?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apovzner","html_url":"https://github.com/apovzner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apovzner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apovzner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apovzner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apovzner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apovzner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apovzner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apovzner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apovzner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apovzner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-07T22:53:24Z","updated_at":"2016-04-07T22:53:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@granders Thanks a lot for your comments.
