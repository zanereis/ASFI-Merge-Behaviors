I have a manual \"Run DAG\" button on my wishlist :)\n\nCould an externally-triggered DAG be executed like a backfill for a single dttm? For example:\n`airflow execute <DAG> <DTTM>`, roughly equivalent to `airflow backfill <DAG> -s <DTTM> -e <DTTM>`.\n\nI think this would make sensors much more powerful, since the analytics would be more closely aligned with the DAG (event-based rather than interval-based).\n\n@georgebdavis I think this is still a little different from your question about letting tasks define other tasks and add them to an (in-flight) DAG. Would more powerful ad-hoc DAGs solve your use case there? My initial interpretation of your request was that you had a task which loaded some parameters or metadata and then used those to add downstream tasks to the DAG. Maybe you would actually generate an entirely new DAG on-demand and trigger it, rather than adding tasks to the current DAG.

For reference, here are the cases I've seen from myself or others:\n- doing the same set of work at a set of timings determined by a remote service\n- performing a set of analyses on every file in a folder, row in a database, or component in a social graph\n\nIn each of these cases, I know the work I want to do at deployment time, just not exactly when / how many times / on what.  Enumerating those repeated chunks as separate DAGs is actually a great feature, because it lets Airflow align the repeated steps (tasks) across runs for analytics, and perform localized management operations on e.g. all tasks upstream of a certain point within one run of one chunk.\n\nSo, my problem is not really with static DAGs but with the fact that they can be only triggered by time.  If I could schedule a DAG run on demand, ideally with a wee bit of metadata so that tasks know what triggered the run, I could have all of the features that depend on the static DAG and still deal with the irregularities in my schedule.\n\nI can't think of a realistic use case where a truly dynamic DAG would be preferable to dynamically triggering static chunks.  Extremely complex workflows might require tons of DAGs triggering each other - but if you find yourself in that situation, maybe you're using a workflow scheduler to do flow control that would be better implemented as program logic?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/139681120/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/139688008","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/289#issuecomment-139688008","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/289","id":139688008,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzOTY4ODAwOA==","user":{"login":"jlowin","id":153965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Mzk2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/153965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin","html_url":"https://github.com/jlowin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-11T23:46:32Z","updated_at":"2015-09-11T23:46:32Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"That sounds right -- I also discovered that most of my \"dynamic\" DAGs were actually just static DAGs being used repeatedly but at non-regular times.

I think I need to squeeze a section in the FAQ that clarifies how much dynamism make actual sense.\n\nAnother way to put it is to relate workflow and tasks to databases and tables. If you write code that alters your table structures based on the program's logic, you're probably doing it wrong. The number of tasks in a data processing workflow is often directly correlated with the number of data structures (tables). Sometimes it makes sense to break down you unit of work to a subset of a table, and to partition your tables to play along with that. For example our A/B testing framework's pipeline is partitioned and \"tasked\" at the data source level. When a new data source gets added, the corresponding tasks and partitions get created dynamically. Individual sources can get processed independently as they land, and experiments that pick smaller of more reliable sources are likely to land earlier in the day.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/139693756/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/139693910","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/388#issuecomment-139693910","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/388","id":139693910,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzOTY5MzkxMA==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-12T00:57:10Z","updated_at":"2015-09-12T00:57:10Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Do you have a zombie task instance that is flagged as running but not actually running?

You also have some good language in a few threads about reorienting workflows to, for example, operate on all files rather than doing one task per file.  Also to pick up occasional changes in a workflow by making the script declaring the DAG itself dynamic.  Probably good stuff for that FAQ section!\n\nThe catch that led me to this thread is wanting to use Airflow's failure-management features to resume flows that fail during these corner cases.  If the \"per-file\" work is complex, I don't want a failure on one file to block and require repeating of the whole task.  And if the DAG-generation script would have to pull a schedule off of a failure-prone external service, I don't want Airflow to potentially barf when loading it.  When you(/we?) get dynamic triggering going, I can take care of both kinds of risk by making a task that triggers a separate, pre-declared DAG.  Then a failure in pulling down an external schedule just blocks that triggering task, and a failure in the \"per-file\" DAG only holds up that run.\n\n(Now I'll officially stop belaboring how excited I am about that feature :) )\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/139702098/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/139809593","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/340#issuecomment-139809593","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/340","id":139809593,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzOTgwOTU5Mw==","user":{"login":"syvineckruyk","id":335167,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNTE2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/335167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/syvineckruyk","html_url":"https://github.com/syvineckruyk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syvineckruyk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syvineckruyk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syvineckruyk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syvineckruyk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syvineckruyk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syvineckruyk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syvineckruyk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syvineckruyk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syvineckruyk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-12T18:54:24Z","updated_at":"2015-09-12T18:54:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":":+1: \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/139809593/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/139931692","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/391#issuecomment-139931692","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/391","id":139931692,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzOTkzMTY5Mg==","user":{"login":"puneethpotu","id":8812146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTIxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8812146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneethpotu","html_url":"https://github.com/puneethpotu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneethpotu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneethpotu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneethpotu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneethpotu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneethpotu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneethpotu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneethpotu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneethpotu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneethpotu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-14T00:39:45Z","updated_at":"2015-09-14T00:39:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Initially my start_date was set to `start_date: datetime.today()` after changing it to as shown above code in my previous comment, the tree got updated to show the status of the tasks.
