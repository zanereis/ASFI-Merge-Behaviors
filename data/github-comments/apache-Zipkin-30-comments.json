Whether or not some library inside twitter.app automagically accepts env variables is a different point than the list of known tested properties.\n\nBy supporting a closed set of env properties, backends can work cross-language. Ex. someone writing a collector in go has a limited set of well-known properties they'd need to support. This works today. For example, the closed set of env variables is why you can drop in the java or the scala query server and get the same behavior in docker (service-level abstraction). All of the readmes include a closed set of properties and what they do. I've found a closed set quite helpful when discussing support issues with @prat0318 for example.\n\nOn the functionality side, Spring boot does auto-export, but I consider that an internal detail. Ex Some of the names aren't well thought through, or eagerly configurable. If we formally support implicitly defined variables, we'd have a harder time removing or changing them in the future. Sometimes changing them is needed to better design the component. For example, some things keep an internal queue when maybe they shouldn't.\n\nLong story short, if/when finatra could support auto-export, and we could use that feature, I would still want to explicitly call out TTL as a supported feature vs an accident of a flag name. I do find value in such a feature as it could allow us to experiment with not-yet-supported flags easier.\n\nHope this essay helps :)\n\nPS #1041 would need to be addressed before a flag auto-env-binder would be usable.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/198162306/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/198162689","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1041#issuecomment-198162689","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1041","id":198162689,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5ODE2MjY4OQ==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-18T01:59:49Z","updated_at":"2016-03-18T01:59:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"PS I'm in favor of letting flags pass through.

There exists a sentiment that they could be simpler, ex a String->String map. If we formally support reporting the originating host of a binary annotations, this limits model options to those that intentionally allow repeats. [Zipkin v2](#939) could solve this, if it stays single-host spans. If it doesn't, and a String->String map was chosen, then changing the UI to report the origin of a tag wouldn't be supportable.\n\nThis situation is not new, by the way, just solving it hasn't proved popular. Even here, multiple folks are working around this as opposed to asking for this to be changed. Ex filtering duplicates, or they have adjusted their tracers to avoid the ambiguity. Personally, I'm happy about that, as the act of \"choosing\" on conflict for most fields, particularly span name, has proven high-maintenance code. Leaving that undefined for routine binary annotations is less code to maintain.\n\nSince the time we introduced zipkin's http api, one could troubleshoot any issue like this by looking at the json for the trace. In fact, I noticed in a screen shot that Uber actually have \"json\" UI element, which could make navigation even easier. I'd recommend we sit on this and consider it for zipkin v2 vs investing further time into this topic, as rehashing this hurts the project by displacing time.\n\nIn the mean time, we might want to formalize a UI element to make getting to the raw json easier.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/198825497/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/198840878","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/1057#issuecomment-198840878","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1057","id":198840878,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5ODg0MDg3OA==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-20T03:44:05Z","updated_at":"2016-03-20T03:44:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"very subtle, but the issue isn't about null, rather undefined.
