This PR is tackling two issues: 1) adding new interfaces for Table API input formats, 2) pushing filter predicates into sources. 1) will end up being a question of style, i.e. whether we want to have two input interfaces, or just one that can do both. \n\nOn 2), I think we need a different approach. The approach taken in this PR is to enhance the Rules that analyze/transform expression with knowledge about the input operation. This allows to backtrack fields to the sources and notify the source of used fields/predicates. I think, however, that this is not the correct level to implement it. The plan of operations is a Tree itself and can also be analyzed/transformed using the Tree framework of the Table API. I think it would be beneficial to provide analysis steps that can actually push filters towards the sources. (And then fuse adaptive source and filter if possible) This will be helpful even if no adaptive sources are present and it will transform one valid tree of the user query into another valid tree of the user query which makes it easy to see the optimizations that are taking place and to debug it.\n\nTo show what I mean I implemented a small prototype that prunes unused fields of selection expressions and pushes filters towards sources: https://github.com/aljoscha/flink/tree/table-filter-push. There is an example in there: `FilterPushExample.scala`, the code for tree analysis is in `PlanAnalyzer.scala`. The example query is this:\n\n```\nval input = env.fromElements((1, 1, 1), (2, 2, 2), (4, 4, 4), (5, 5, 5))\n\n    input\n      .as('a, 'b, 'c)\n      .select('a as 'd, 'b, 'c + 15 as 'e)\n      .filter('d > 3)\n      .select('d)\n      .toDataSet[Row].print\n```\n\nif the example is run it will print the operation tree after tree analysis phases, this is the printout:\n\n```\nBefore PushFilter: Select(Filter(Select(Root(MapOperator@49c43f4e,ArraySeq((a,Integer), (b,Integer), (c,Integer))), 'a as 'd,'b,('c + 15) as 'e), 'd > 3), 'd)\nAfter PushFilter: Select(Select(Filter(Root(MapOperator@49c43f4e,ArraySeq((a,Integer), (b,Integer), (c,Integer))), 'a > 3), 'a as 'd,'b,('c + 15) as 'e), 'd)\nBefore prune: Select(Select(Filter(Root(MapOperator@49c43f4e,ArraySeq((a,Integer), (b,Integer), (c,Integer))), 'a > 3), 'a as 'd,'b,('c + 15) as 'e), 'd)\nAfter prune: Select(Select(Filter(Root(MapOperator@49c43f4e,ArraySeq((a,Integer), (b,Integer), (c,Integer))), 'a > 3), 'a as 'd), 'd)\nROOT used fields: a\n\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/162553706/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/162555049","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1435#issuecomment-162555049","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1435","id":162555049,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MjU1NTA0OQ==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-07T15:20:03Z","updated_at":"2015-12-07T15:20:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Makes

Otherwise `ExecutionEnvironment.getExecutionPlan()` fails with a NPE. Costs can be 0, IMO but we should set the correct physical properties because these are visualized and might confuse users.\n- The injected plan node should have good names that indicate that they belong to the range partitioner. I suggest:\n  - `sipPlanNode`: \"RangePartition: LocalSample\"\n  - `sicPlanNode`: \"RangePartition: GlobalSample\"\n  - `rbPlanNode`: \"RangePartition: Histogram\"\n  - `ariPlanNode`: \"RangePartition: Partition\"\n  - `prPlanNode`: \"RangePartition: Partition\" (IMO its fine to have the same name here. Too much detail such as assign id and unwrap might just confuse)\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nBtw.

I published a prototype of it in mid-September (#1127), where I wanted to know if the concept is fine. I won't have the resources and motivation to start from scratch.\n\nYes, you are right. Your solution is the nicer one. However, the question is how much optimizer logic the Table API should have implemented. Actually I wanted to discuss the following under FLINK-2099, but we can also discuss it here. If we base some further developed library such as Calcite on top of the Table API, optimizer logic will be unnecessary in the near future. In a long term perspective it might make sense to convert Table API DSL to Calcite nodes, optimize them, and use the Table API plan nodes only as the physical plan nodes (for code generation) without further optimization. In this case the only thing missing is predicate/projection pushdown from the Table API tree into the input formats. Calcite could do push down for us.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/162622155/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/162634935","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1437#issuecomment-162634935","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1437","id":162634935,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MjYzNDkzNQ==","user":{"login":"rmetzger","id":89049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger","html_url":"https://github.com/rmetzger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-07T19:34:29Z","updated_at":"2015-12-07T19:34:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank

Can you revert it and rebase the second last commit on the current master?\n\nI also got feedback from @StephanEwen about the use of the IntDistribution. He shares your opinion, that it is not really needed and just incurs additional overhead due to the second binary search. He proposes to use a `PARTITION_CUSTOM` strategy instead of a `PARTITION_RANGE` strategy with a `Partitioner` that simply returns the partition id. You basically can replace \n`partChannel.setShipStrategy(ShipStrategyType.PARTITION_RANGE, keys, sortDirection, null, DataExchangeMode.PIPELINED);`\nby \n`partChannel.setShipStrategy(ShipStrategyType.PARTITION_CUSTOM, keys, new IdPartitioner(), DataExchangeMode.PIPELINED);`\nand provide an implementation for IdPartitioner. This way, we have still support for generic DataDistribution range partitioning (although not being used ATM) and a more efficient automatic range partitioning. \n\nOn last very small remark. Could you please set the parallelism also for the `OptimizerNodes` (`sipNode`, `sicNode`, etc.)? Otherwise, the JSON output will have some `\"parallelism\": \"default\"` values.\n\nI think we're almost there. :-)\nThanks a lot, Fabian\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/162935419/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/162943866","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1416#issuecomment-162943866","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1416","id":162943866,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2Mjk0Mzg2Ng==","user":{"login":"rmetzger","id":89049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger","html_url":"https://github.com/rmetzger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-08T16:55:05Z","updated_at":"2015-12-08T16:55:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you for the good review\nI've addressed all your concerns.

Works well with `gulp watch` and custom web frontend port.\nA few things I noticed:\n1. Job Manager's log and stdout are not accessible with CORS, since they're served via `StaticFileServerHandler` which doesn't set CORS headers. This however shouldn't be an issue. We need to have a better logs service anyway, for both Job manager and task managers IMO.\n2. At some point, we will remove the `GET /jobs/<job-id>/yarn-cancel` method, which is only there due to a limitation of yarn. To this end, there needs to be an `OPTIONS` handlers for the `DELETE` request to send CORS response headers in the preflight phase. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS#Preflighted_requests.

for the initiative, Robert. I had a look and here are some thoughts:\n\n### General Comments\n- The interface declarations should declare their targets:\n  - @PublicInterface should have `@Target(ElementType.TYPE)`\n  - @PublicExperimental should have `@Target({ ElementType.TYPE, ElementType.METHOD })`\n- How about shortening the name `@PublicInterface` to `@Public` or `@PublicAPI`\n\n### Stability decisions to make before 1.0\n- We need to think about whether we change the RichGroupReduceFunction to implement the regular combine function (combining into one value) rather than the group combine function. While API breaking, it allows for more efficient pre-aggregations.\n\n### Classes that I suggest not to declare public\n- `Key` (I would suggest to entirely remove that class, separate Pull Requests)\n- `Nothing` (May even remove that and replace it by `Void`)\n- `InputSplitAssigner` : I think we need to change that one a bit to support more fine grained fault tolerance for data sources.\n- `ConfigConstants` : Not sure if we should encourage people to use this class.\n- `AccumulatorHelper` : No need to expose this, and might change.\n- `IntCounter`, `LongCounter`, `DoubleCounter` : These are actually \"sums\", not couners. If we declare them stable, we should at least fix their wrong name ;-)\n- Anything under `org.apache.flink.api.common.aggregators`. Would be nice to have aggregators unified with accumulators in the long run.\n- For the same reason, we need to mark the Aggregator releated methods in `IterationRuntimeContext` as experimental.\n- `StrictlyLocalAssignment` : This is still experimental, we have not yet had users of that and a chance to see it validated.\n- `SemanticProperties` could be declared public experimental.\n- `TypeSerializer` and `TypeComparator` : These are not touched by users usually, and we may want to change them a lot depending on future designs for serialization improvements and intermediate data layout.\n\n### The following classes should be declared as stable, in my opinion:\n- `GenericInputSplit` : Part of the publis stable `GenericInputFormat`\n- `SplittableIterator` : This is an exposed class for parallel collection sources.\n- `TraversableOnceException` : Simple (and virtually empty) exception class thrown into user code by the runtime.\n\n### Classes that are good candidates for public API:\n- `NumberSequenceIterator` : This is a good and stable utility class.\n- `XORShiftRandom` : This is a good and stable utility class.\n- `MemorySegment` : If in the future, we allow UDFs to reserve and use managed memory (as suggested by Chengxliang Li's pull request, this will need to be declared stable later anyways)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/164288665/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/164296923","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1434#issuecomment-164296923","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1434","id":164296923,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NDI5NjkyMw==","user":{"login":"gyfora","id":5880972,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODA5NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5880972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora","html_url":"https://github.com/gyfora","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-13T20:51:49Z","updated_at":"2015-12-13T20:51:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"How do I increase the timeout for the savepoint?
