I agree with @rdhabalia. Adding this note in user doc doesn't address the problem raised in #5683 .

Look up all bundles of all broker, then traverse all topics under these bundles, and finally return topics. A large part of this operation is network delay. Therefore, when concurrent requests are large, the above problems will occur. I have not found a suitable way to solve this problem through fix code, but I have two alternatives to query `non-persistent topic`.\r\n\r\n1. Reasonably evaluate your query request and configure the appropriate number of numHttpServerThreads, but this method cannot completely solve the above problems.\r\n\r\n2. The proposal is divided into the following three steps\r\n\r\na. Get all broker addresses\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl -v http://any-broker-ip:8080/admin/v2/brokers/cluster-name\r\n```\r\n\r\nb. Loop the following rest API to obtain bundle\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl -v http://broker-1:8080/admin/v2/non-persistent/test/test-namespace\r\ncurl -v http://broker-2:8080/admin/v2/non-persistent/test/test-namespace\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe following results will be returned\r\n```\r\n\"bundles\" : {\r\n    \"boundaries\" : [ \"0x00000000\", \"0x40000000\", \"0x80000000\", \"0xc0000000\", \"0xffffffff\" ],\r\n    \"numBundles\" : 4\r\n  },\r\n```\r\n\r\nc. Get the topic under the bundle through the bundle.\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\nhttp://broker-ip:8080/admin/v2/non-persistent/test/test-namespace/0x00000000_0x40000000\r\nhttp://broker-ip:8080/admin/v2/non-persistent/test/test-namespace/0x40000000_0x80000000\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nI

I think either of those ideas would be a step in the right direction. Anything that will increase the confidence that, if you are using dotnet and want to use Pulsar, you'll have the ability to leverage the features you need and have good support from the community.\r\n\r\nThe two projects out there now seem to be going in different directions. One aiming to match the features of the java client and the other not as much. Neither have many contributors (yet). Neither of them have a solid roadmap (yet). Neither of them support all the features of the java client (yet). Specifically I see both are missing Schema which, in my mind, is a key feature. This all makes my confidence level that we will be able to leverage all of Pulsar's features in the near future using dotnet somewhat low.\r\n\r\nI am in a similar situation as @rcollina where I think Pulsar is the better option for my company but for better or worse dotnet core is where we are headed with all future development. I worry we will not be able to use Pulsar to its full capability with the state of the two dotnet pulsar clients at present and it is a huge commitment to make without high confidence.\r\n\r\nHopefully this provides some insight that may help you move the dotnet support forward in some way.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/562629715/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/562636163","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/5794#issuecomment-562636163","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/5794","id":562636163,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MjYzNjE2Mw==","user":{"login":"wolfstudy","id":20965307,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTY1MzA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20965307?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfstudy","html_url":"https://github.com/wolfstudy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfstudy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfstudy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfstudy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfstudy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfstudy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfstudy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfstudy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfstudy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfstudy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-06T16:12:44Z","updated_at":"2019-12-06T16:12:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"run integration tests\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/562636163/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/562655535","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/5808#issuecomment-562655535","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/5808","id":562655535,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MjY1NTUzNQ==","user":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-06T17:03:34Z","updated_at":"2019-12-06T17:03:34Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@huangdx0726 the example is written in Java.
