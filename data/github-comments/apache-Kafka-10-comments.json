you can start reviewing if you have time. I'm primarily interested in your opinion about the approach of using a zk handle directly to solve this. I think it is ok, but creates some redudancy in ZkUtils. \n\nThings that I'm not entirely happy with about the patch:\n1- Upon a connectionloss event, it'd be better to wait until a connected event before retrying. The way it is isn't wrong, but it will be looping until it reconnects.\n2- The current tests cover a lot of the functionality, so I think it is not worse compared to the existing trunk code, but I want to spend a bit more time thinking about test coverage.\n3- I'm thinking that we should remove ZkUtils.createEphemeralPathExpectConflictHandleZKBug.

Convert the object into a class so that parameters can be passed during instantiation\n2. Use an implicit parameter in the object methods to pass a context object implicitly\n\nFor option 1, we could have a class parameter called `defaultAcls` and the code that did the read of the system property, parsing and so on would be elsewhere. This separation is a nice bonus. Sadly, I think this change would affect quite a few files. I am not aware of an automated refactoring tool for this, but it would be worth checking.\n\nFor option 2, there would be an implicit parameter in every method with the acls. Due to the way implicits work, you'd want to introduce a new type for it (e.g `ZkAcls`). It involves some repetition as it needs to be part of every method. It could perhaps replace the `acls` parameter though. In order to make this implicit automatically available, you could add the default implementation in the companion object of `ZkAcls` (the compiler will look there if it can't find one in scope). In a test, you can create a different implicit and put it in scope so that it's used before the one in the companion object. I think this way may be less invasive although it's less clear than option 1, especially for someone who is not very familiar with Scala's implicit resolution rules.\n\nBefore we go in either direction, it may be worth discussing this with another committer (maybe @junrao and/or @gwenshap). In my opinion, reading a property inside a Scala object to control behaviour is something to be avoided as it makes testing much harder as can be seen here.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/137830837/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/137831817","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/130#issuecomment-137831817","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/130","id":137831817,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNzgzMTgxNw==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-04T19:24:24Z","updated_at":"2015-09-04T19:24:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[kafka-trunk-git-pr #356](https://builds.apache.org/job/kafka-trunk-git-pr/356/) FAILURE\nLooks like there's a problem with this pull request\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/137831817/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/137849200","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/194#issuecomment-137849200","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/194","id":137849200,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNzg0OTIwMA==","user":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-04T20:51:38Z","updated_at":"2015-09-04T20:51:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Tests passed locally.
