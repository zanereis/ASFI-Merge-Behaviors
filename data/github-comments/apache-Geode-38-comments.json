With our changes, `FunctionService.getFunction(String)` will now return a `TimingFunction` instead of the function that that was passed to `FunctionService.registerFunction(Function)`. This could be a problem for users if they are doing an explicit cast after getting the function, like `(MyFunction) FunctionService.getFunction(\"MyFunction\")`. Is this a breaking change? I have a thread going on the dev list about this topic.\r\n2. The PR is failing `AnalyzeSerializablesJUnitTest.testSerializables` because we added a new Serializable class, `TimingFunction`. We need to determine if this class can actually be serialized. If it cannot, we just need to add it to `excludedClasses.txt` and we're done. If it can be serialized, we need to consider the implications. One possible way to avoid backwards compatibility issues would be to override the serialization behavior to replace the serialized form of `TimingFunction` with that of its inner function. After considering the implications, adding the class to `sanctioned-geode-core-serializables.txt` will fix the failing test.\r\n3. Many D-unit tests are failing due to `ClassCastException` and `AssertionError` being thrown because we are now returning `TimingFunction` instead of the function that was passed to `FunctionService.registerFunction(Function)`. We verified that these exceptions are all thrown from test code and not product code. We need to update the test code to expect an instance of `TimingFunction` and know how to get the inner function from the `TimingFunction`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/530520277/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/530553073","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/4044#issuecomment-530553073","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/4044","id":530553073,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMDU1MzA3Mw==","user":{"login":"jhuynh1","id":5750994,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTA5OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5750994?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhuynh1","html_url":"https://github.com/jhuynh1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhuynh1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhuynh1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhuynh1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhuynh1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhuynh1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhuynh1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhuynh1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhuynh1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhuynh1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-11T20:30:55Z","updated_at":"2019-09-11T20:30:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think the commit message title could be improved to maybe describe what this commit is doing?

I think we'll probably want to look at how to reconcile the two.  The goal of GEODE-7177 is to move dependencies on logging-related classes used by the `org.apache.geode.distributed.internal.membership.gms` package into something other than geode-core (see the test in `MembershipDependenciesJUnitTest.java`).  Would geode-log4j be an appropriate place to move the classes we need to break the dependency on geode-core?  The idea would be that eventually nothing in `org.apache.geode.distributed.internal.membership.gms` will depend on core, and as such, we can test the membership components in isolation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/532035840/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/532297695","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/4003#issuecomment-532297695","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/4003","id":532297695,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMjI5NzY5NQ==","user":{"login":"aaronlindsey","id":1781978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODE5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1781978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlindsey","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronlindsey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlindsey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlindsey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlindsey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlindsey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlindsey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlindsey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlindsey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlindsey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlindsey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-17T16:29:20Z","updated_at":"2019-09-17T16:29:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@mcmellawatt @kirklund \r\n> Would geode-log4j be an appropriate place to move the classes we need to break the dependency on geode-core?\r\n\r\nThe goal of this PR is to remove geode-core's dependency on log4j-core, so that users may use a different logging backend (such as logback) more easily.

I believe our continued use  and preference of \"internal\" APIs as integration points with a lack of real SPIs is the main reason behind this. **I think it's vital that we steer our project away from having to use ambiguous or hazy internal APIs between modules or as integration points. It should be very clear which APIs can or cannot change without breaking integration points and without having to describe some bizarre policy that's more complicated than \"internal\" vs \"external\".** \r\n\r\nWe need clear, distinct \"external\" APIs between modules as well as integration points. I believe this promotes non-Pivotal employees becoming involved in Geode, contributing their own SPI provider implementations and helping to integrate Geode with more environments and 3rd party libraries of various sorts. \r\n\r\nEvery time we double down on \"internal\" APIs we end up breaking Spring Data Geode or other non-open-source integration. Ultimately, these \"internal\" APIs promote tribal knowledge in our project and prevent us from clearly knowing what can or cannot change in our code base. \r\n\r\nI feel very strongly against using \"internal\" APIs as integration points between modules and I feel even more strongly against discouraging Geode users and non-committers from extending Geode and trying to write their own implementation providers. I'm not interested in making it difficult for others to do the same thing we are doing. I want to improve Geode code quality and make integration with it clear and easy instead of difficult or esoteric.\r\n\r\nJust imaging an open-source world in which we have non-Pivotal employees write and contribute a module such `geode-logback` or do any of the integration that Spring Data Geode does (which currently requires \"internal\" APIs).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/532913736/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/532921722","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/4003#issuecomment-532921722","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/4003","id":532921722,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMjkyMTcyMg==","user":{"login":"lgtm-com[bot]","id":43144390,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDMxNDQzOTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/17324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/lgtm-com","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-19T00:59:46Z","updated_at":"2019-09-19T00:59:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This pull request **fixes 4 alerts** when merging 85f676a361b9926e53bcccf043119120d823ed6e into 165648b27c29c1b722e2a67b14468f990d26a8ac -

I will preface that I haven't read the entire PR. I would prefer to have seen an RFC that described the intent of this PR. I believe the intent is to move all the Log4J specific code into its own module. This module is expected to be an SPI implementation of the Geode logging service, such that another implementation could be dropped in without changes to any code.  Based on this assumption here is what I would expect:\r\n* There should not be any new public APIs defined at this time.\r\n* A new experimental public SPI should be defined to plug in Geode logging service implementations. \r\n  * Preferably this new SPI would be in some module of its own, like `geode-logging-spi`.\r\n* This new module should implement this SPI and only export said implementation (java 9 modules).\r\n  * Preferably this new SPI implementation would depend only on `geode-logging-spi` (see java 9 modules too).\r\n* Other modules, including core, should not depend directly on this new SPI implementation module.\r\n* `log4j-api` should be exported as `api` scope only on the module that exports the logging service SPI.\r\n  * Preferably a `geode-logging` module that exports the logging API, `o.a.g.i.l.LogService`, which includes `log4j-api` as `api` scope since that is what our `LogService` returns.\r\n  * All modules expecting to use Goede logging service should depend on `implementation geode-logging`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/533244113/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/533276976","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/4067#issuecomment-533276976","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/4067","id":533276976,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMzI3Njk3Ng==","user":{"login":"alb3rtobr","id":5363407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjM0MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5363407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr","html_url":"https://github.com/alb3rtobr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-19T19:36:45Z","updated_at":"2019-09-19T19:36:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":">

There is some danger in the rolling upgrade tests. I would suggest a separate PR to just clean up the dependency mess. There are other things like this we could clean up. Also converting to Java Library plugin all over should clean up some messes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/533671996/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/533671998","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/4078#issuecomment-533671998","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/4078","id":533671998,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMzY3MTk5OA==","user":{"login":"jujoramos","id":8254001,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNTQwMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8254001?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jujoramos","html_url":"https://github.com/jujoramos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jujoramos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jujoramos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jujoramos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jujoramos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jujoramos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jujoramos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jujoramos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jujoramos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jujoramos/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-20T18:57:25Z","updated_at":"2019-09-20T18:57:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hey @upthewaterspout,\r\nYes, the idea is that, if you annotate a class with `@Immutable`, then all fields within **that single class** will be ignored by the rule.
