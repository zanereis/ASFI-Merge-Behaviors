Here are some thought what we could improve:\n- Keeping the UnknownTypeInfo all the way and actually trying to work with it will shadow problems. At much later points, when someone tries to use a POJO field on the type info, an error will occur, at a point that is disconnected from the source of the problem.\n- How about we rename the `UnknownTypeInfo` to `MissingTypeInfo` and use it only as a place-holder for the `returns()` hint method, which exchanges that type info by the proper one.\n- We could make sure that type extraction failures are recognized early, by having the `getType()` method on the DataSet throw an error if only a `MissingTypeInfo` exists.\n- Getting Generic Lambdas to run with this may not be a good idea. This goes against my original suggestion to keep this for the purpose of local development with OracleJDK, but in hind-sight, I think things will get quite intransparent to reason about and hard to maintain/debug/fix.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/64698910/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/64699176","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/61#issuecomment-64699176","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/61","id":64699176,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0Njk5MTc2","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-26T19:33:46Z","updated_at":"2014-11-26T19:33:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Never hurts to have the tests.

Well commented, plenty of tests, nice!\n\nApart from Scala API support, there are several ways how this PR could be extended:\n1. Extend aggregation support for Flink's mutable value types (IntValue, DoubleValue, ...), i.e., sum() and avg() on numeric *Value types\n2. Add support for POJO data types and allowing aggregations of their members (output would still be tuples). This would mean to extract the aggregation fields by name in the initial Map operator.\n3. Do the aggregations internally on *Value types, which would mean to transform Java Standard types into *Values in the first Map operator.

I hope for many feedback about this idea. There are two functions for this feature.\n1. `FileMonitoringFunction` emits a tuple with 3 parameters.

This function implements `FlatMapFunction` because there is no method to link between two source functions.\n\nWhen a user calls `readFileStream` in `StreamExecutionEnvironment`, the system creates a `FileMonitoringFunction` and `FileMapFunction` and links them and returns them.\n\nWith this implementation, we can fix the problem about parallelism with monitoring instance. The user can set degree of parallelism of source. In fact, the user set degree of parallelism of map function. There is only one instance monitoring file system.\n\nAdditionally, we can reuse `FileMapFunction` to substitute `FileSourceFunction`.\n\nHow about this implementation?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/65885299/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/65889528","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/226#issuecomment-65889528","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/226","id":65889528,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1ODg5NTI4","user":{"login":"gyfora","id":5880972,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODA5NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5880972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora","html_url":"https://github.com/gyfora","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-06T08:08:23Z","updated_at":"2014-12-06T08:08:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think this is a good way to do the file partitioning among the source instances, I like it.\n\nAt least the partitioning logic is separate from the actual source processing the files and we can change the components later easily.\n\nThe name FileMapFunction might be a little confusing.
