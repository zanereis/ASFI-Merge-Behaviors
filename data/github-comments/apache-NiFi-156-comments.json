I think it will have to work the opposite way, with `protect(final String unprotectedValue, final ProtectedPropertyContext context)` that calls `protect(final String unprotectedValue)`, since the calling code will always reference the 2-argument method.  But the effect will be the same, allowing SPPs to only implement the version they need to, while still only providing one version of the methods in the interface.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/883611885/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/883621146","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5230#issuecomment-883621146","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5230","id":883621146,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM40qv0a","user":{"login":"nerdfunk-net","id":86735509,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NzM1NTA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/86735509?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerdfunk-net","html_url":"https://github.com/nerdfunk-net","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerdfunk-net/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerdfunk-net/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerdfunk-net/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerdfunk-net/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerdfunk-net/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerdfunk-net/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerdfunk-net/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerdfunk-net/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nerdfunk-net/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-20T18:57:54Z","updated_at":"2021-07-20T18:57:54Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"removed
