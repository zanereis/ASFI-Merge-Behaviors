The weights always remain the same.\r\n\r\nI'm not familiar with torch, and I'm assuming that the AddTable is a declarative way of writing addition. In Gluon, this should be written in `hybrid_forward`. In that method, `x` is your input data, and you can use the layers declared in the constructor such as `self.U` by calling them with the input data (i.e. `output = self.U(x)`), just like calling a function in python. Once you finish writing the calculation of `C[i]` and `U`, Addition is then the simple addition of `C_out + U_out`.\r\n\r\nA great place to start learning about gluon is the interactive book. http://gluon.mxnet.io/.

In MXNet, most of the simple operators shares the same kernels between CPU and GPU. That's why there is a template argument called `xpu` in Forward and Backward function as [this](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/src/operator/tensor/control_flow_op.h#L154). If your cpu kernel also works for gpu and you defined Forward and Backward functions using `xpu` template argument, what you need to do is register the operator in a `.cu` file as [this](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/src/operator/tensor/control_flow_op.cu#L29).\r\n\r\nSometimes, complicated operators do not share the same kernels for cpu and gpu as they have different parallelization approaches and each kernel has to be optimized against its own device.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/327685471/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/327687093","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/7778#issuecomment-327687093","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/7778","id":327687093,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNzY4NzA5Mw==","user":{"login":"ptrendx","id":8398980,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzOTg5ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8398980?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx","html_url":"https://github.com/ptrendx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-07T05:07:30Z","updated_at":"2017-09-07T05:07:30Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"V100 as in Volta?

You'll have lots of cores running in parallel working on different requests, and you won't need a copy in memory of the model for each worker.\r\n\r\nGetting a complex codebase to be threadsafe is no small task, so this won't be \"resolved\" any time soon.  Fortunately it's not necessary here for most of what you want.  Your answer lies in the Unix fork() command.  If you want to understand, go read: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(system_call)\r\n\r\nThe magic of fork is copy-on-write memory semantics whereby each forked worker has its own virtual memory address space, but they all share the same physical memory.  (Until one of them writes to the shared memory, in which case a private copy of that memory block is made in that process's virtual address space -- thus \"copy-on-write\".)  So even though it's not multi-threaded, fork() & pre-fork worker servers like gunicorn let you accomplish almost the same thing with multiple processes instead of threads.  Forked processes are somewhat more heavyweight than threads, but they're nowhere near as expensive as you running the same command multiple times.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/327942322/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/327954372","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/7770#issuecomment-327954372","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/7770","id":327954372,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNzk1NDM3Mg==","user":{"login":"ykim362","id":22177353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTc3MzUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22177353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ykim362","html_url":"https://github.com/ykim362","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ykim362/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ykim362/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ykim362/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ykim362/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ykim362/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ykim362/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ykim362/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ykim362/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ykim362/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-07T23:23:14Z","updated_at":"2017-09-07T23:23:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Could

You can use [sym.ones](https://mxnet.apache.org/api/python/symbol.html#mxnet.symbol.ones) and [sym.concat](https://mxnet.apache.org/api/python/symbol.html#mxnet.symbol.concat) to create the vector for image mean, and then [sym.broadcast_sub](https://mxnet.apache.org/api/python/symbol.html#mxnet.symbol.broadcast_sub) for the mean subtraction. There may be better solutions out there, and this is one solution that I can think of.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/327987249/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/327989958","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/7802#issuecomment-327989958","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/7802","id":327989958,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNzk4OTk1OA==","user":{"login":"dyzhou2015","id":15317407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzE3NDA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15317407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyzhou2015","html_url":"https://github.com/dyzhou2015","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyzhou2015/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyzhou2015/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyzhou2015/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyzhou2015/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyzhou2015/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyzhou2015/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyzhou2015/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyzhou2015/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyzhou2015/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-08T03:31:48Z","updated_at":"2017-09-08T03:31:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"thanks
