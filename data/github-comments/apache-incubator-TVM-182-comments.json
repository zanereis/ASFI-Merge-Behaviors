It's a bit weird that `_alter_conv2d_layout` receive a conv2d op with `NCHWc` layout.\r\n\r\nMy usecase is that, I want to use `nn.conv2d` with \"NCHWc' layout in the frontend. I noticed that there are `relay.nn.contrib_conv2d_nchwc` and `contrib_depthwise_conv2d_nchwc`. I think users do not need to choose from `conv2d_nchwc` and `depthwise_conv2d_nchwc` manually. And I want TVM to decide which to use automatically - just like what TVM is now doing on `conv2d` with \"NCHW'.  So I use \"NCHW16c\" in `nn.conv2d`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n\r\nfrom tvm import relay\r\nimport tvm\r\n\r\nimg = relay.var(\"img\", shape=(128, 3, 224, 224, 1), dtype='float')\r\nweight = relay.var(\"weight\", shape=(1, 3, 3, 3, 1, 16 ), dtype='float')\r\nconv = relay.nn.conv2d(img, weight, strides=(2, 2), padding=(1, 1),\r\n    dilation=(1, 1), groups=1, channels=16, kernel_size=[3, 3],\r\n    data_layout='NCHW1c', kernel_layout='OIHW1i16o', out_layout='NCHW16c')\r\nfunc = relay.Function([img, weight], conv)\r\ntarget = 'llvm -mcpu=skylake-avx512'\r\nctx = tvm.context(target, 0)\r\nprint(func)\r\nwith relay.build_config(opt_level=3):\r\n    graph, lib, params_fwd = relay.build(func, target)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSupporting \"NCHWc\" in `nn.conv2d` will make the frontend cleaner: users can use `nn.conv2d` for depthwise or not, and blocking format or not. TVM will choose the implementation (like `depthwise_conv2d_nchwc`) under the hood.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/621567041/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/621572608","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/5471#issuecomment-621572608","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5471","id":621572608,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyMTU3MjYwOA==","user":{"login":"zhanghaohit","id":7508922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MDg5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7508922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghaohit","html_url":"https://github.com/zhanghaohit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghaohit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghaohit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghaohit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghaohit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghaohit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghaohit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghaohit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghaohit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghaohit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-30T02:18:45Z","updated_at":"2020-04-30T02:18:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Thanks @zhanghaohit for the proposed change, moving away from a hardcoded value is the right move!\r\n> \r\n> I find the `ACC_DEP_DISTANCE` to be confusing however.

Considering future parsing use, we must print the dtype for every const number. But we may use some shorthand for common dtype. e.g. `2f` for float32, `2h` for float16(half), direct`2` for int32 (for here most integer numbers in schedule are int32).

Minor nits, A better commit message would be to refer to handling batch matmul in fully connected op rather than what it stands.\r\n> \r\n> Isn't there a need for Quantized inputs testing here ?\r\n\r\n@u99127 : Thanks for your comments! Just for your info, TFLite converter has multiple limitations in terms of various input types supported, so it is not possible always to add all the cases. \r\nI had already tried for it, but converter has errors. Also it does not support N-dim.\r\n\r\nAbout the commit, actually the changes are quite unrelated to batch matmul, it is just that open up the issue in implementation. So IMO the commit message looks ok to me. Please let me know if you think otherwise.
