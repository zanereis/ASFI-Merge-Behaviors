This PR works for all tests that extend `SolrTestCaseJ4`, because all of those tests expect to have the SSLConfig configured by `SolrTestCaseJ4.setupTestCases()`:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nsslConfig = buildSSLConfig();\r\n// based on randomized SSL config, set SocketFactoryRegistryProvider appropriately\r\nHttpClientUtil.setSocketFactoryRegistryProvider(\r\n    sslConfig.buildClientSocketFactoryRegistryProvider());\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, other tests, such as the one that is failing, extend `SolrTestCase`, and expect to have the default SSLConfig configured by default (a good assumption IMO). This test fails because the test ran before it extends `SolrTestCaseJ4` and the randomization selected HTTPS for that run. After the test succeeded, SolrTestCaseJ4 no longer reset the SSLConfig, and then  `ConcurrentUpdateSolrClientBuilderTest.testSocketTimeoutOnCommit()` tried to connect to an HTTP endpoint using the HTTPS SSLConfig, which fails.\r\n\r\nI think we should just revert this and keep the original logic.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2648778043/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
