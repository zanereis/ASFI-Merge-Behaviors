Maybe it will do so _anyway_. If we want to guarantee it, we could modify this code to recognize the coordinator somehow.\r\n\r\nI am unfamiliar with the short circuit logic but based on debugging if we stop using `_` as shard id in `CloudDescriptor` (as in this PR), then `canShortCircuit` might start returning true (that's my guess of using `_` originally in the Cloud descriptor in the synthetic core). Not totally sure about the implication but  `rb.shortCircuitedURL =\r\n            ZkCoreNodeProps.getCoreUrl(zkController.getBaseUrl(), coreDescriptor.getName());` will be executed and a short circuited URL will be used? which seems incorrect since the coordinator node does not actually host the shard?\r\n            \r\nSorry I'm really helping much here 😓 , however to play safe, we might want to keep returning `false` for  canShortCircuit calls done on Cooridnator node as you proposed (ie modify this code to recognize the coordinator somehow)?

We can additionally assert that in the other case, whenever the HEAD request is fired, that it contains a body, by looking at the new variable created in `DebugServlet`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2563894874/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2564185125","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2869#issuecomment-2564185125","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2869","id":2564185125,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6Y1lwl","user":{"login":"dsmiley","id":377295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzI5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/377295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley","html_url":"https://github.com/dsmiley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-12-28T05:08:24Z","updated_at":"2024-12-28T05:08:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I tweaked the tests based on feedback.\r\nLooking to merge this soon.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2564185125/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2564228811","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2915#issuecomment-2564228811","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2915","id":2564228811,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6Y1wbL","user":{"login":"dsmiley","id":377295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzI5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/377295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley","html_url":"https://github.com/dsmiley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-12-28T06:36:23Z","updated_at":"2024-12-28T06:36:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ah; thanks for making the important distinction between constraints and dependencies.

That is - only the properties being modified need be provided.  This is convenient and intuitive, but creates a problem that the v1 API felt it needed to solve: how can users \"unset\" a property entirely?  In v1 this is done by providing a property, but with a value of empty-string (i.e. `\"\"`).\r\n\r\nThis is a problem in the v2 world, where properties are strongly typed.  The v2 API expects properties like `perReplicaState` or `replicationFactor` to have non-string types (Boolean and Integer, respectively), so the empty-string flag value (understandably) triggers a Jackson deserialization error.\r\n\r\nI'm not totally sure what to do about this.  We've got a few options, but I'm not sure what is best.\r\n\r\n1. Ditch the strong-typing on our request-body POJO, so that the empty-string flag val is valid for all properties.\r\n2. Investigate whether Jackson has some way to differentiate which properties were provided in the input JSON, and use that to support \"unsetting\".\r\n3. Add an additional \"unset\" property to the request-body POJO, that takes a list of property names to unset in the collection-state.  I've taken this approach for now in the PR to get tests, etc. passing - it was simple and easy to implement. But I don't like it as a long term solution.\r\n4. Ditch support for property \"unsetting\" in v2 altogether.  Others may know, but I'm not sure what use-case this capability serves. IMO it's confusing semantically - what does it mean to unset a \"replicationFactor\" property, for instance?  It may be around for a very clear and relevant purpose, but if it's not, maybe removing it is a plausible path forward?\r\n5. Something else?\r\n\r\nI'm a bit stumped on how to proceed, so I'd love feedback or thoughts if anyone has them.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2566985693/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2568273954","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2919#issuecomment-2568273954","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2919","id":2568273954,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6ZFMAi","user":{"login":"dsmiley","id":377295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzI5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/377295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley","html_url":"https://github.com/dsmiley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-02T19:34:29Z","updated_at":"2025-01-02T19:34:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yes; anything deprecated in 9x is removable in 10x.\r\nThat's a general statement, and it applies here too.

HashMap is called HashMap because it explains its implementation via use of the hashCode() and thus get(key) is `O(1)`.

I recall there was concern that implementing Map would lead to people passing this off to code that makes assumptions on Map having better than `O(N)` lookup by key (even TreeMap is `O(Log N)`) but NamedList is `O(N)` leading to a performance problem for non-trivial sized NamedLists.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2572254142/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2572645379","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2936#issuecomment-2572645379","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2936","id":2572645379,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6ZV3QD","user":{"login":"janhoy","id":409128,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTEyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/409128?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy","html_url":"https://github.com/janhoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-06T09:15:30Z","updated_at":"2025-01-06T09:15:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Triggering a solrbot run to test...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2572645379/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2572657658","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2937#issuecomment-2572657658","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2937","id":2572657658,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6ZV6P6","user":{"login":"solrbot","id":125606113,"node_id":"U_kgDOB3yY4Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125606113?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/solrbot","html_url":"https://github.com/solrbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solrbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solrbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solrbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solrbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solrbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solrbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solrbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solrbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solrbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-06T09:22:50Z","updated_at":"2025-01-06T09:22:50Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"### ⚠️ Artifact update problem\n\nRenovate failed to update an artifact related to this branch.

It's for something super lean/fast that's only for transferring stuff (i.e. to be serialized), navigated by iteration once.  For that use-case, a hashCode system is a waste.  But Solr uses it for configuration as well, a questionable choice that's not in line with NamedList's advantages.  Perhaps a radical point of view is that NamedList shouldn't even have \"get\" methods, leaving only iteration, thus emphasizing its purpose.  For sure, Solr over-uses NamedList.

Or should I use\r\n> the RestTestBase and go that route instead?\r\n\r\nMy two cents are that we'd be better sticking to a Java-based test here.  BATS tests give you, in some senses, a bit more fidelity than a JUnit test since they're testing the same tgz or zip distribution that an end-user downloads, but that comes at a pretty steep cost: they're much much slower to run, can't be parallelized, aren't cross-platform, etc.\r\n\r\nSo my suggestion would be to write in Java unless you run into a reason to do otherwise.\r\n\r\nThat said - if you like the simplicity of BATS or think the extra fidelity is worth it, I'm OK with that too.  This'll be a big boost to our v2 test coverage, so it'll be a huge win whichever approach you take.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2583508494/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2583773292","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2935#issuecomment-2583773292","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2935","id":2583773292,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6aAUBs","user":{"login":"dsmiley","id":377295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzI5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/377295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley","html_url":"https://github.com/dsmiley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-10T19:34:33Z","updated_at":"2025-01-10T19:34:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I simplified characterization of how I think this should be done:\r\n* on initialization, copy the configured URLs to a field for safe keeping.
