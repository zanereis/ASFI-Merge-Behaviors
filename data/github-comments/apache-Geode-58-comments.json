latest commit makes a subtle change to `SSLUtil.createAndConfigureSSLContext`. It removes some code duplication by adding a single implementation for loading the key/trust managers instead of one implementation in `SocketCreator` and another implementation in `SSLUtil`. This was necessary because otherwise we would create multiple file watches for the same file which would lead to confusing logs and behavior. The SocketCreator implementation is chosen because it handles passwords provided by env var, encrypted passwords, and having the key/trust store file located in the user's home directory. However, this means that now SSLUtil will behave the same way as SocketCreator (whereas previously SSLUtil did not handle env var passwords, encrypted passwords, or home directory key/trust store file).\r\n\r\nI'm requesting a re-review from codeowners of the relevant files since it was a non-trivial change.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/800604696/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/800715555","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/6075#issuecomment-800715555","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/6075","id":800715555,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwMDcxNTU1NQ==","user":{"login":"lgtm-com[bot]","id":43144390,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDMxNDQzOTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/17324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/lgtm-com","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-17T01:02:34Z","updated_at":"2021-03-17T01:02:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This

With regard to caching the crc16 in the region entry - I agree it probably doesn't need to be serialized. I'm also not sure whether it would be more efficient to cache the hashCode or the CRC16 - I wish we didn't call the PartitionResolver more than once!\r\n\r\nAt some point there is a tipping point were the serialization of 2 bytes is cheaper than the CPU time to recalculate the CRC remotely. Keeping in mind that for Geode that CPU is also trying to process primary updates too. Or would it even need to be calculated remotely if since it is only used for bucket placement, and that is already known when replicating.\r\n\r\nSimilar question can likely be said for the hash code's 4 bytes. Since to be placed in to correct map slot remotely the hash code must be known so is recalculation on the remote side more costly in CPU than the 4 bytes on the wire?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/802361566/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/802367822","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/6144#issuecomment-802367822","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/6144","id":802367822,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwMjM2NzgyMg==","user":{"login":"lgtm-com[bot]","id":43144390,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDMxNDQzOTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/17324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/lgtm-com","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-18T22:58:47Z","updated_at":"2021-03-18T22:58:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This pull request **introduces 1 alert** and **fixes 1** when merging 6df94e288d0078f67dd6897690ae44354a29432c into 0870d5dc2fd769d51f63ec7e0d64c9c8cb4d2c8f -
