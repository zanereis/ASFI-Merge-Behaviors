for late response.\r\nI updated the code based on the review comments.\r\n\r\n@b-slim I don't understand your point about backward compatibility because `mapName` is optional argument and users always make LookupDimensionSpec with json  so that they just omit\r\n `mapName` in their spec when their lookups do not have multiple maps.\r\nAnd I still think having separate `mapName` is better than combining `name` and `mapName` because user may use combining delimiter (ex. `.`) in `name` or `mapName`.\r\nHowever, it makes sense that `mapName` is unclear so I changed it to `innerMapName`. Welcome any suggestion.\r\n\r\n@gianm For escaping column and table names at SQL query creation, I use escape and quote methods of SQLTemplate in Querydsl.
