@wilderrodrigues \nI was hoping on reducing the number of changes from this PR to master, so it would be better if you pushed it along with your refactor and i'll just rebase with master, since i don't know when this will get merged :)\nDuring your Libvirt refactor pushes, i was having some trouble with that specific test taking too long to run, it was fixed after i set the timeout (after 5 seconds failure, waits no longer to fail and continues), so this speeds things up unless a connection is actually established, not the other way around :)\nReplacing that with a static final would be nice, but like i said, this is a copy/paste from the xenserver class of the same name, so that change should be applied there also in order to be consistent.\n\nI'd rather not add any more fixes that are unrelated to the tomcat change into this PR

the data is still stored in a .js variable and accessible to scripts, only the location of the data has changed, but this not confer extra security.\n\nBasically, all this did was break the functionality and remove 1 of the 2 places where the sessionkey was accessible through javascript.\n\nMy new proposal is to actually get httponly cookie working, which thwarts most kinds of XSS attacks.\nThis is done by making the server handle the cookie (not the client).\n\nThe only thing i didn't fix was the same security hole being created by the SAML login (cookie with sessionkey data is created in browser), since i didn't have it setup to test. These changes shouldn't break it though, it will just keep the same insecure behaviour.\n\nHave a look at my proposed changes :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/105861689/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/105868482","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/308#issuecomment-105868482","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/308","id":105868482,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwNTg2ODQ4Mg==","user":{"login":"stephen-turner","id":5031457,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMzE0NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5031457?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephen-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/stephen-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephen-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephen-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephen-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephen-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephen-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephen-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephen-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephen-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephen-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-27T10:57:27Z","updated_at":"2015-05-27T10:57:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"As

Great btw that some stuff ended up in separate PR (that got merged).\n\nMore general, could you please squash your commits?

@remibergsma \nFirst of all. thank you for your comment :)\nI've been very busy these past couple of days, so i haven't gotten around to do what you suggested, but i will take care of that over the weekend (squash commits, clean description of fixes), I will also try to get a couple more stuff in as separate pull requests and clean up a couple more things ;)\n\nAs for testing this, there is no other way to test this other than manually since marvin doesn't even use tomcat for testing, altough the travis setup scripts download an old version of tomcat into the hard disk the tests do nothing with it :) That should also be cleaned up.\nAnother handy thing that's really missing in the tests is a test to packaging! In the past weeks a few things got into master that completely broke packaging.. although Rohit fixed most of that already, centos6 packaging is still broken.\nAs a side note, management server on master also still doesn't work in Centos 7.1 and Fedora 21.. that's all in here hehe ;)\n\nIf you guys would like, i can also alter the test scripts to use the same tomcat that will be used in the actual product instead of jetty, which will make for a test scenario closer to reality. This can be done in a way which will easily allow switching between tomcat and jetty in the future :)\n\nWhat do you think of that?\n\nBR,\nRafael\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/106741425/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/106743307","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/238#issuecomment-106743307","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/238","id":106743307,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwNjc0MzMwNw==","user":{"login":"wilderrodrigues","id":5129209,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMjkyMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5129209?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues","html_url":"https://github.com/wilderrodrigues","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-29T08:24:24Z","updated_at":"2015-05-29T08:24:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @rsafonseca \n\nI got your PR to build the RPMs and do some manual tests on it.\n\nRPMs were created successfully!

@wilderrodrigues \n\nBoth the issues you hit are legacy behaviour :)\n\nI'm guessing that you've deployed it in debian, because the server.xml issue is handled properly by the RPM installers, but not by the debian one.\n\nTo have it working after install on debian, just run the cloudstack-setup-management script, which i think is the standard way of setting things up, that's why I didn't bother to get the server.xml properly linked on package install in debian yet.\n\nI've been thinking about doing something better (at least that's my opinion, please drop a comment on this) which is setup the management server to ALWAYS run with both HTTP and HTTPS right after setup (using generated cert until user provides one)\n\nAbout that mysql-ha lib i guess it's one of the optionally packed libraries? i still haven done any testing on those. I just left this bit as it was.\n\nHappy testing :)\n\nRF\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/106752449/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/106755009","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/238#issuecomment-106755009","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/238","id":106755009,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwNjc1NTAwOQ==","user":{"login":"wilderrodrigues","id":5129209,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMjkyMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5129209?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues","html_url":"https://github.com/wilderrodrigues","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-29T09:22:27Z","updated_at":"2015-05-29T09:22:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @rsafonseca \n\nI built the RPM on CentOS7:\n\n[root@cs5 ~]# uname -a\nLinux cs5 3.10.0-229.1.2.el7.x86_64 #1 SMP Fri Mar 27 03:04:26 UTC 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\n[root@cs5 ~]# cat /etc/centos-release\nCentOS Linux release 7.1.1503 (Core) \n\nI will try executing the cloudstack-setup-management script on my centOS as well.\n\nCheers,\nWilder\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/106755009/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/106758023","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/238#issuecomment-106758023","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/238","id":106758023,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwNjc1ODAyMw==","user":{"login":"rsafonseca","id":12141667,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQxNjY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12141667?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca","html_url":"https://github.com/rsafonseca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-29T09:32:55Z","updated_at":"2015-05-29T09:32:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Indeed.. it's only setup on centos 6 and not 7, sorry for misleading you there :)\ncloudstack-setup-management will link the server.xml in any environment anyway.\n\nThe current version on master drops a server.xml in the folder (for Centos7 only), but it doesn't support SSL.

@rsafonseca thanks for the update and patch. It's a good idea to use HTTPOnly flag on cookie to ensure we have the authentication going on and at the same time not expose the cookie value to javascript. But the current patch will break SAML and any redirected authentication which relies on cookies being read by JS and then destroyed. As an alternative, let's discuss how we can improve this:\n1. When a user is authenticated, we set the sessionkey cookie (httponly). This btw, only protects it from being read by JavaScript and not MITM attacks. For this, we can use a global setting I had added (isSecureSessionCookieEnabled method in ApiServer can be used for this) to enable secure flag on it as well. Please use Cookie class for this instead of adding raw strings like: resp.addCookie(new cookie(with flags etc enabled.)\n2. In HttpUtils, add helper method:\n   public static String findCookie(final Cookie[] cookies, String key) {\n       for (Cookie cookie: cookies) {\n           if (cookie.getName().equals(key)) {\n               return cookie.getValue();\n           }\n       }\n       return null;\n   }\n3. In ApiServlet, use the above method to find the cookie value (if available) when there is no sessionkey or empty sessionkey passed in the API params, check against session's sessionkey value to invalidate session. \n4. When users use default login method (login command), the login response still has the sessionkey. So, we can discuss to remove this as a security measure as well. If users are using an external logging system such as SAML based, usually the plugin would set the cookie. If the cookie becomes httponly (so JavaScript won't be able to read it), we will need to fix the JavaScript code such that it does not rely on sessionkey parameter at all.\n\nPlease review the above ideas and comment/share on them.\n\nTLDR? To fix the login/UI issue, I think we need to not depend on passing a sessionkey as API argument but instead use HTTPOnly (and enable secure flag, so cookies are passed on HTTPs if enabled) \"sessionkey\" cookie along with the JSESSIONID cookie. Doing this would make sure we can run ACS UI across tabs and let the UI work when a external auth system such as those based on SAML, 2-factor or OAuth can work.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/106800322/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/106811796","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/325#issuecomment-106811796","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/325","id":106811796,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwNjgxMTc5Ng==","user":{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-29T13:57:43Z","updated_at":"2015-05-29T13:57:43Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@wilderrodrigues you bet :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/106811796/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/106818248","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/308#issuecomment-106818248","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/308","id":106818248,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwNjgxODI0OA==","user":{"login":"rsafonseca","id":12141667,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQxNjY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12141667?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca","html_url":"https://github.com/rsafonseca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-29T14:09:59Z","updated_at":"2015-05-29T14:09:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi Rohit, thank you for your view on this :)\nHere's my comment on it:\n1. No use on protecting the sessionkey from MITM attacks, as the username/password are sent in plain text, and so are all the other commands, so anyone can pickup your credentials if they're listening on the wire ;). For MITM protection SSL should be used. I did notice that isSecureSessionCookieEnabled i actually placed the cookie in raw to be exactly the same as the sessioncookie. I did use the cookie class for reading though :). So.. both cookies should be inserted in the same fashion.\n2. Will take care of that :)\n3. I miss the purpose.. session cleanup? Can you explain a bit more? :)\n4. If you don't return it in the loginResponse, regular (non-browser) calls to the API will fail, because i guess all integrations with the API depend on it, that's why i didn't remove it. It can be in the response, as long as javascript doesn't store it for later access.\n\nRegarding the non-bulleted stuff:\n\nSecure cookie:\nI don't agree with this one, that will make it just not work at all in HTTP. We aim to fix a browser vulnerability here, not a communication channel one. If someone wants on the wire security, they should just switch to SSL.\n\nNot depend on sessionkey as API argument:\nWill that not break some API implementations? I think supporting both methods is the best for now.\n\nAbout SAML and redirect based auth not working:\nAre you sure? Did you test? I left it in a way it would likely work... cookie is still read an put into the javascript variable if it was created on redirection. Since the SAML plugin just puts it back in a cookie so i didn't bother destroying it in that scenario, the plugin should be modded for that. Either way.. it _should_ work :)\n\nThanks for reviewing.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/106818248/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/106874647","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/328#issuecomment-106874647","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/328","id":106874647,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwNjg3NDY0Nw==","user":{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-29T17:15:15Z","updated_at":"2015-05-29T17:15:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I swear I did remove them, probably some merge issue.

The issue here is that for normal login it would work, because the login response will send the sessionkey which javascript code will save in a g_ (global) variable and reuse it for future API requests. In case of alternative auth/login, for example the SAML plugin, we rely only on cookies but if you make the sessionkey cookie httponly - the JS code won't be able to read that and future APIs will send empty sessionkey API arg/parameter. Now, to make this work - the APIServlet needs to check for sessionkey cookie in case sessionkey HTTP parameter is missing or empty. The SAML plugin would set a sessionkey cookie that is readable but since in the fix after we authenticate() you're setting sessionkey cookie to be httponly (so after login/redirection, JS code won't be able to read that cookie). If this is confusing, leave it for me - I can help fix this.\n- Regarding point 4, I guess what I meant to say is not to remove the argument but cover the above case. I agree we don't need to remove it since API clients may break.\n\nI guess we have some agreement here, please go ahead and make the changes. I'm working on making the SAML plugin production grade, so I can help test all aspects of logging/authentication around it as well.\n\nCheers.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/106906370/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/106907445","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/302#issuecomment-106907445","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/302","id":106907445,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwNjkwNzQ0NQ==","user":{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-29T19:20:37Z","updated_at":"2015-05-29T19:20:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@vadimkim thanks for the fix but it did not apply cleanly.
