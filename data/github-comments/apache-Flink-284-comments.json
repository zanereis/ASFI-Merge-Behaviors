for addressing the comment.\r\n\r\nOne more thing, I think we do not actually need the `running` flag because we register streams in closable registry. In case of canceling the job, the runnables will either fail to register streams or will be interrupted because streams will be closed unexpectedly and break the while loop anyways with IO exception which is what we want. The while loops will not hold executor shutdown for long.

Thank you for your review. I've updated the PR according to your comments. \r\n\r\nThere are still two main discussion points from @twalthr review:\r\n1. Moving `PatternVariableFinder`, which also validates that there is only a single pattern variable in an aggregation, to e.g. `DataStreamMatchRule`. The main role of this class is to extract that single variable though. If I performed the validation at an earlier stage, I would have to traverse the expression with the same code in `MatchCodeGenerator` anyway, but I am ok with it, if you think it is worth it.\r\n2. Using `aggCall.toString` as a key for reusing code for aggregation for a single variable that was used multiple times in an expression. I could not think of better way to identify that it is the same expression.

Hi, thanks a lot for your review and great suggestions. I have updated the pr according to your suggestions. Changes mainly include:\r\n- Add `UnresolvedKeyFieldReference`\r\n- Rename `LastRow` to `UpsertToRetraction`\r\n- Generate `UpsertToRetraction` from `RelTimeIndicatorConverter` to `EnumerableToLogicalTableScan`\r\n- Add `RemoveDataStreamUpsertToRetractionRule` to `UpsertToRetraction` relnode if it is a no-op node.\r\nWould be great if you can take a look when you are free.
