In stead of manually combining modules, we can modify nnvm.compiler.build from `_build(funcs, target, target_host)` to:\r\n\r\n1. _build([lower_func_list1, lower_func_list2], targets, host_target)` or dict device_module : lo\r\nwered_funcs pairs.\r\n\r\n2. `_build(funcs, func_cnts, targets, host_target)` where `funcs` are grouped in graph_compile.cc, i.e. [gpu, gpu, gpu, cpu, cpu, cpu, fpga, fpga], and 'func_cnts' is the number of lowered_funcs for each target. This is a little tricky, but I think it's okay. \r\n\r\nWe can then call tvm.build several times to generate code and combined them together, e.g. having a simple combine_module API in build_module which calls `import`.
