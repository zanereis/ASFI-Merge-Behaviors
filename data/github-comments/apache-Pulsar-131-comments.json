\r\n\r\nI think `isSchemaValidationEnforced` is only applied for producers without schema connecting to a topic with schema.

It means a consumer with schema attempts to consume messages from a topic without schema.\r\n\r\nIn your case,\r\n\r\n- the Kafka source is transferring bytes from a Kafka topic to a Pulsar topic. It will create a pulsar topic `persistent://example-tenant/ingest/example-kafka-topic` without schema.\r\n- The function is consuming from the Pulsar topic `persistent://example-tenant/ingest/example-kafka-topic` with a string schema. (because the schema is inferred from the function input type).\r\n\r\nHence the function will fail to start because the function attempts to consume `persistent://example-tenant/ingest/example-kafka-topic` with a string schema.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThere are a few workarounds:\r\n\r\n1) you can precreate the topic with `String` schema. so that Kafka source is able to produce with `isSchemaValidationEnforced` setting to true.\r\n\r\n2) you can disable schema compatibility check by setting the namespace's schema compatibility check policy to `None`: `bin/pulsar-admin namespaces set-schema-autoupdate-strategy -d tenant/namespace`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWe can also consider extending `isSchemaValidationEnforced` for disabling schema validation completely.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/517065570/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/517066210","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/4855#issuecomment-517066210","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/4855","id":517066210,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNzA2NjIxMA==","user":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-01T00:01:50Z","updated_at":"2019-08-01T00:01:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@grantwwu I think there are bunch of fields added to function config since 2.2.1.
