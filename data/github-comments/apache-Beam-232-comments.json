TableProvider's responsibility:\r\n  a) Generate a `BeamSqlTable` from a `create table` statement.\r\n  b) Provides API to query all the tables of this kind of tables. e.g. For txt tables, it is always an empty list, since there is no persistent storage to hold the meta. While if we have a HiveTableProvider, all the tables in hive is provided by the Hive Meta database.\r\n\r\n2. `MetaStore` aggregates all the tables from all the table providers and expose a facade api to `BeamSqlEnv.SchemaPlus` to use. So there will be only one `MetaStore` for one `BeamSqlCli`, you can define your own `MetaStore`, but you can only use one every time.\r\n\r\n3. So the load flow is:\r\n\r\n> physical_metadata_store --> TableProvider(there can be many providers) -> meta_store --> BeamSqlEnv.SchemaPlus\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/314629626/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/314630427","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3546#issuecomment-314630427","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3546","id":314630427,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNDYzMDQyNw==","user":{"login":"reuvenlax","id":21071061,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDcxMDYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21071061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax","html_url":"https://github.com/reuvenlax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-12T02:55:36Z","updated_at":"2017-07-12T02:55:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"retest this please.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/314630427/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/314638873","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3530#issuecomment-314638873","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3530","id":314638873,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNDYzODg3Mw==","user":{"login":"takidau","id":14131530,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTMxNTMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14131530?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/takidau","html_url":"https://github.com/takidau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takidau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takidau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takidau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takidau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takidau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takidau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takidau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takidau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takidau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-12T04:07:11Z","updated_at":"2017-07-12T04:07:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Merged, feel free to close.
