Hierarchical Log Management and Debugging</p>\n\n<p>    Originally all logs (both for workers and daemons) are under storm-home/logs, this causes name confusion (\"wc22-1-1445957152-worker-6700.log\") and difficulty for debugging (hard to store and manage heapdump and gc log files for all topologies' workers in a single directory). <br/>\n    For better management, we present the Worker Artifacts Directory for Hierarchical Log Management and Debugging: </p>\n\n<p>    1. workers' logs and metadata are moved to the new directory \"storm-local/workers-artifacts\", while daemon logs are still placed in storm-home/logs. </p>\n\n<p>    2. Cleanup, view and list implementations are modified accordingly in logviewer and UI. Specifically, we add per-worker quota and total quota for files' size, and the cleanup thread will periodically cleanup the oldest files in each worker directory and the whole artifacts if the quota is exceeded. Note that, the active workers' active logs will be skipped during cleaning.</p>\n\n<p>    3. In addition, a symlink called artifacts is created from each worker's directory to its log directory \"workers-artifacts/topoId/port/\". gc.log and heapdump files can be configured by users to place under this symlink, thus able to be downloaded from UI conveniently. Other useful features can be easily support by worker artifacts directory, where their resource files can be dumped.</p>\n\n<p>    4. Unit tests are added and the event log are supported under each worker's artifacts directory.</p>\n\n<p>    Current log structures under storm-local/workers-artifacts:<br/>\n    --topoId0<br/>\n    --topoId1<br/>\n    ------port1<br/>\n    ------port2<br/>\n    ---------worker.log<br/>\n    ---------worker.log.err <br/>\n    ---------worker.log.out<br/>\n    ---------worker.yaml<br/>\n    ---------gc.log<br/>\n    ----------heapdump<br/>\n    ----------events.log</p>\n\n<p>You can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:</p>\n\n<p>    $ git pull <a href=\"https://github.com/zhuoliu/storm\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/zhuoliu/storm</a> 901</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/822.patch\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/822.patch</a></p>\n\n<p>To close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch<br/>\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:</p>\n\n<p>    This closes #822</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>commit 4ab6a0f2d2af36102157b632ee55929534165b36<br/>\nAuthor: zhuol <zhuol@yahoo-inc.com><br/>\nDate:   2015-10-26T16:37:43Z</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-901\" title=\"Worker Artifacts Directory\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"STORM-901\"><del>STORM-901</del></a> worker-artifacts for logviewer</p>\n\n<p>commit 28899baf3a24ab435cbb3db13decafb652ba3afe<br/>\nAuthor: zhuol <zhuol@yahoo-inc.com><br/>\nDate:   2015-10-26T20:50:10Z</p>\n\n<p>    Solve event-log issue, ui, dir, routes, listLogs</p>\n\n<p>commit 8d9bb1fb8cddef900d53d42b06fd8952cb5b4cb7<br/>\nAuthor: zhuol <zhuol@yahoo-inc.com><br/>\nDate:   2015-10-27T02:59:27Z</p>\n\n<p>    Fix supervisor test</p>\n\n<p>commit c7bbd091b06b68bd8d22a6f66a4210bcf4a475fa<br/>\nAuthor: zhuol <zhuol@yahoo-inc.com><br/>\nDate:   2015-10-27T14:34:03Z</p>\n\n<p>    Add unit tests for logviewer cleanup, filter, sorting, etc.</p>\n\n<hr />","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612573573/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612619509","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4972#issuecomment-2612619509","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4972","id":2612619509,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI2MTk1MDk=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-27T15:46:15Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T14:09:12Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=githubbot\">githubbot</a>:</i>\n<p>GitHub user harshach opened a pull request:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/823\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/823</a></p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-1134\" title=\"Windows: Fix log4j config.\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"STORM-1134\"><del>STORM-1134</del></a>.

I got no failures anywhere during the testing.\nThe following numbers were all collected on the nimbus/ui/zk/supervisor/logviewer node.  I also launched the topology from that node, so it would probably be the most overloaded.  All the other nodes were running a supervisor/logviewer/zk\n\n```\ntop - 14:29:54 up 57 min,  4 users,  load average: 5.21, 4.50, 3.23\nTasks: 132 total,   2 running, 130 sleeping,   0 stopped,   0 zombie\nCpu(s): 48.0%us, 42.2%sy,  1.7%ni,  0.2%id,  0.5%wa,  0.0%hi,  7.3%si,  0.2%st\nMem:   4055232k total,  3161188k used,   894044k free,   123084k buffers\n```\n\nThis is the output of running zktop.py against the zk ensemble (IP addresses and Host names changed).\n\n```\nEnsemble -- nodecount:32 zxid:0x10000086b sessions:16\n\nID SERVER           PORT M    OUTST    RECVD     SENT CONNS MINLAT AVGLAT MAXLAT\n0  NIMBUS  2181 F        0     3895     3901     5      0      1     33\n1  SUPER1  2181 L        0     2054     2054     3      0      1     22\n2  SUPER2  2181 F        0    11358    11376     8      0      0     29\n\nCLIENT           PORT S I   QUEUED    RECVD     SENT\nNIMBUS   54133 0 1        0      330      330\nNIMBUS   54629 0 1        0     1313     1313\nNIMBUS  55899 0 0        0        1        0\nSUPER1    41270 0 1        0     1305     1305\nNIMBUS   54130 0 1        0      511      511\nNIMBUS   49674 1 1        0      357      357\nNIMBUS   51440 1 0        0        1        0\nSUPER2   60290 1 1        0     1305     1305\nSUPER2   51100 2 1        0     1147     1151\nNIMBUS   53264 2 1        0     1148     1152\nNIMBUS   53088 2 1        0     7937     7940\nNIMBUS   54851 2 0        0        1        0\nSUPER1    60972 2 1        0      216      216\nNUMBUS   53263 2 1        0      217      217\nSUPER1    60973 2 1        0     1148     1152\nSUPER2   51098 2 1        0      216      216\n```\n\nEverything there looks OK.\n\nDisk utilization while the test is running is between 0.6% and 0.7%.

If somehow the connection slipped to 100 Mbit then this would possibly explain what you are seeing, but it is just a guess.\n\nI have screen shots of the UI too, but I don't think it will add much.
