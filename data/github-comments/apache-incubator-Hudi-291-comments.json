This DynamoDB table is automatically created by Hudi, so you don't have to create the table yourself. If you want to use an existing DynamoDB table, make sure that an attribute with the name key is present in the table. The key attribute should be the partition key of the DynamoDB table. The config hoodie.write.lock.dynamodb.partition_key specifies the value to put for the key attribute (not the attribute name), which is used for the lock on the same table. By default, hoodie.write.lock.dynamodb.partition_key is set to the table name, so that multiple writers writing to the same table share the same lock. If you customize the name, make sure it's the same across multiple writers.\r\n\r\nhttps://hudi.apache.org/docs/concurrency_control\r\n\r\nHope this answers your question. \r\nFeel free to re-open or
