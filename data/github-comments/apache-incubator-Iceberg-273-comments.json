Without inheriting snapshot ID every manifest must be rewritten as well as metadata.json since the snapshotId being assigned needs to be added to every manifest row.

Even if I try to update only 1 string column i still get the `ClassCastException`\r\n\r\nIf i change the merge query to the below then all is good. I tried this by running with out the limit. Stil it worked good. The schemas of the `select .. limit 100` match with the schema of `x11`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nsess.sql(\"\"\" MERGE INTO x11  t \r\n                 using ( select * from cdc limit 100)  u \r\n                 on t.cdc_oid = u.cdc_oid \r\n\r\n                   when not matched then insert * \"\"\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut if i change the same to below\r\n\r\n```\r\nsess.sql(\"\"\" MERGE INTO x11 t \r\n                 using ( select * from cdc limit 100)  u \r\n                 on t.cdc_oid = u.cdc_oid\r\n                   when matched then update set t.cdc_pk = '' \r\n                   when not matched then insert * \"\"\")\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen the merge fails with an exception (`Caused by: java.lang.ClassCastException: org.apache.spark.unsafe.types.UTF8String cannot be cast to java.lang.Long`)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen i compare the schemas of `cdc_oid` for both x11 and cdc they are both string-s. \r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1683714428/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1683725234","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/7137#issuecomment-1683725234","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/7137","id":1683725234,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85kW5uy","user":{"login":"marvin-roesch","id":4181659,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxODE2NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4181659?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marvin-roesch","html_url":"https://github.com/marvin-roesch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marvin-roesch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marvin-roesch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marvin-roesch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marvin-roesch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marvin-roesch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marvin-roesch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marvin-roesch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marvin-roesch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marvin-roesch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-18T10:45:34Z","updated_at":"2023-08-18T10:45:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I can confirm that we are experiencing the same issue when inserting records into an Iceberg table using Trino.
