I found this project [angular-web-notification](https://github.com/sagiegurari/angular-web-notification) which makes a wrapper of HTML5 desktop notification and supports for different browsers. I incorporated it into Zeppelin, it works like this:\n\n![part1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8494212/12155988/273d0bd6-b47d-11e5-96a5-7103b92fbf88.gif)\n![part2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8494212/12155993/2cd7f36c-b47d-11e5-8087-4900eda72919.gif)\n\nHow do you guys think?\n\nFor the \"run all paragraphs\" issue, indeed we need to find a way to make it as an exception and only send notification when all paragraphs are finished. However I didn't figure out how to keep track of this progress. I can disable notification with \"runNote\", but I have no idea where/when to re-enable it. And it seems that Zeppelin now supports multi-thread execution within one notebook, so tracking status of last paragraph doesn't work neither.

Going forward I'm going to be maintaining this article, not my original blog post.  One of the big (unsung) advantages of Zeppelin is it makes big data products friendly to work with (e.g. copy and paste code, no command line, no setting up an overwhelming IDE like jetbrains, etc.) Things we tend to take for granted as developers.  In my mind, for many people using this tutorial, this is their first experience building a package from source.  \n\nMy point being: Waiving my hands and saying sometimes things don't work and its not your fault, then leaving it at that is probably a little too dismissive, I want to let users know, \"just because the build is failing- don't get discouraged, try it again and if it still doesn't work, reach out to the community for help, and in some cases, you just need to walk away from it for a little while, that's life.\"  \n\nA blurb in there about looking through the logs is a good idea.  I'm going to disconnect my internet and try building again to get the specific error message because in my experience (having coached a few novices through the process), that really is the most likely reason for a failure (assuming you have followed the directions carefully). \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/169518501/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/169520079","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/418#issuecomment-169520079","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/418","id":169520079,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2OTUyMDA3OQ==","user":{"login":"rawkintrevo","id":5852441,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NTI0NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5852441?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rawkintrevo","html_url":"https://github.com/rawkintrevo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rawkintrevo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rawkintrevo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rawkintrevo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rawkintrevo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rawkintrevo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rawkintrevo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rawkintrevo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rawkintrevo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rawkintrevo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-07T01:45:44Z","updated_at":"2016-01-07T01:45:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"That was sloppy copy-paste from my gist.

Yes, HiveInterpreter is based on this interpreter, but I thought it's a natural way of you to commit this PR, then I fix to support to multiple connections. It's a way to conserve your contribution and authority. After that, I'll deprecate HiveInterpreter and any other JDBC-like interpreters, and guide your interpreter by using JDBC connections. As you think this is redundant or don't need to conserve authority, I'll change HiveInterpreter to JdbcInterpreter and deprecate any other interpreters.

I propose we decide nothing for now, and describe how to add specific jdbc interpreter on a document. Except that, It looks good to me.
