Even this is not completely predictable, because we can use pretty much any tag name in [tagOverrideConfig](https://github.com/apache/incubator-pinot/blob/master/pinot-common/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/common/config/TagOverrideConfig.java).  I suggest that we refer the admins to the helix commands to do this operation instead of adding code in pinot. We can add documentation on specific helix commands in pinot docs.

Even this is not completely predictable, because we can use pretty much any tag name in [tagOverrideConfig](https://github.com/apache/incubator-pinot/blob/master/pinot-common/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/common/config/TagOverrideConfig.java). I suggest that we refer the admins to the helix commands to do this operation instead of adding code in pinot. We can add documentation on specific helix commands in pinot docs.\r\n\r\nThanks for your comments @mcvsubbu . I believe this API is still useful for the following reasons:\r\n1) Adding a \"tenant\" as a tag is a very Pinot specific operation. We may not be able to do pre-requisite checks if we do this through helix (eg: retagging from one tenant to another).\r\n2) Having one admin API endpoint is very convenient and allows for the caller (eg: automated cluster/setup tenant, node replacement etc).\r\n\r\nLemme know if you have any more questions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/571335765/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/571344239","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/4957#issuecomment-571344239","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/4957","id":571344239,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MTM0NDIzOQ==","user":{"login":"xiangfu0","id":1202120,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDIxMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1202120?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0","html_url":"https://github.com/xiangfu0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-06T22:30:05Z","updated_at":"2020-01-06T22:30:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> > Will this package name change causing existing realtime tables fail to start consuming?\r\n> > I've also updated the quickstart and examples in #4956\r\n> \r\n> Not sure why you ask, but yes, one may need to change config files to point to the right class, or load the right class names.

I think that this is why @mcvsubbu mentioned that we are probably adding a very similar API that Helix already provides. We currently use Helix's tag mostly for tenant assignment but it's possible that we will use these tags for other features (e.g. multiple tags for multiple features for an instance).  In that case, this API can start to become complex since it will have to include all the validations for different tag usages.\r\n\r\nInstead, I think that it's better to provide very specific API on `/tenants` and limit its functionality to add/remove instances to/from a tenant and not to touch other tags. \r\n\r\nI can think of something like the following:\r\n```\r\nList the instances that belong to a tenant (this already exists)\r\nGET /tenant/{tenantName}\r\n\r\nAdd an instance to a tenant\r\nPOST /tenant/{tenantName}/{instanceName}?type=offline/realtime/broker\r\n\r\nDelete an instance from a tenant\r\nDELETE /tenant/{tenantName}/{instanceName}\r\n```\r\n\r\n@mcvsubbu How do you think on this?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/571359606/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/571369256","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/4957#issuecomment-571369256","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/4957","id":571369256,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MTM2OTI1Ng==","user":{"login":"mcvsubbu","id":2279037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzkwMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2279037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu","html_url":"https://github.com/mcvsubbu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-07T00:02:17Z","updated_at":"2020-01-07T00:02:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> > > Will this package name change causing existing realtime tables fail to start consuming?\r\n> > > I've also updated the quickstart and examples in #4956\r\n> > \r\n> > \r\n> > Not sure why you ask, but yes, one may need to change config files to point to the right class, or load the right class names.

Specifically:\r\n> \r\n> 1. The algorithm on the server side during commit.  Correct me if I am wrong, but I think you want to commit the metadata, and try uploading the segment to its destnation (whether pinot-fs or controller) in the background. Am I right? Or, is it that you attempt to upload the segment, and only if it fails, you commit the metadata and move on? (I think we should think through this, the latter seems better to me).\r\n\r\nUpdated the section: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/PINOT/By-passing+deep-store+requirement+for+Realtime+segment+completion#By-passingdeep-storerequirementforRealtimesegmentcompletion-Modifiedsegmentcompletionprotocol\r\n\r\n> 2. Document the error handling scenario. What happens when the segment upload fails but the commit succeeds ? (the use case for which we are building all this). What happens if another server gets a \"download\" but the committer has not gotten to ONLINE state yet? I think there are many states here that we need to design correctly.\r\n\r\nUpdated this section (will think more cases but the two cases you mentioned are

Minor comment. My preference is to add method in Schema class to get all the fieldspecs to extract. This would allow us to hide the incomingFieldSpec concept and also handle derived fields in future.\r\n> \r\n> I also want to deprecate timespec and move towards datetimefieldspec.\r\n\r\nOne reason NOT to do this in schema is because we will be creating a new collection that includes all fieldspecs except timefieldspec (which will be changed to be the incoming granularity spec). In the past, we have been careful about performance and garbage generation while ingesting records from high throughput streams (1k+ records per second per partition, peak at 10k  when we are starting off consuming a new segment since we don't consume during segment build).\r\n\r\nI suggest we leave it as it is.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/572806087/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/572822332","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/4969#issuecomment-572822332","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/4969","id":572822332,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MjgyMjMzMg==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-10T00:43:52Z","updated_at":"2020-01-10T01:00:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#
