In a heavy workload situation, combined heartbeat and data will make heartbeat response delay enough time, so that leader will step down because of lost majority of heartbeat.  We see this in the stress performance test with async write.  While with streaming write, the issue may be not that obvious.

Prior to the patch they were logged differently (`-1 (default)` for admin/client in the first case, `12345 (custom)` in the second case), but with the patch they both result in the same log output.\r\n\r\nNow assume we only change `raft.grpc.server.port` to a different value in both cases.  Ratis behavior is different for these two configurations (regardless of the patch), since the first one uses the new port as fallback, while the second one has explicit custom config for admin/client ports.\r\n\r\nMy point is that this difference in log messages may be useful in some cases.  (E.g. if someone else is making the config change and you only see the logs.)\r\n\r\nBut the new log content is probably better in most cases.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/comments/1192332989/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/comments/1192368799","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ratis/pull/691#issuecomment-1192368799","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/691","id":1192368799,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBMxbGc5HEhqf","user":{"login":"xleoken","id":95013770,"node_id":"U_kgDOBanLig","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95013770?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xleoken","html_url":"https://github.com/xleoken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xleoken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xleoken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xleoken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xleoken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xleoken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xleoken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xleoken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xleoken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xleoken/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-22T09:23:29Z","updated_at":"2022-07-22T09:24:25Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks @adoroszlai, I've learned most of your points.\r\n\r\nYou are right, they were logged differently  (-1 (default) for admin/client before.

Thanks for review it, also please take a look at the getting started part. Somehow I think the counter example is still too complex, mainly because there's a lot to do to implement the statemachine. Would it be better if we provide a more generic implementation of StateMacine? Another point I'm thinking is that maybe we can provide some build in message encoder/decoders, for now it's required to manually serialize/deserialize the raft messages.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/comments/1196668527/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/comments/1197117466","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ratis/pull/696#issuecomment-1197117466","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/696","id":1197117466,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBMxbGc5HWpAa","user":{"login":"szetszwo","id":907380,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNzM4MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/907380?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo","html_url":"https://github.com/szetszwo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-27T18:06:21Z","updated_at":"2022-07-27T18:06:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Would it be better if we provide a more generic implementation of StateMacine? \r\n\r\nDo you have any suggestions?\r\n\r\n> Another point I'm thinking is that maybe we can provide some build in message encoder/decoders, ...\r\n\r\nThis is also a good idea if we can make it simpler.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/comments/1197117466/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/comments/1197118577","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ratis/pull/696#issuecomment-1197118577","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/696","id":1197118577,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBMxbGc5HWpRx","user":{"login":"szetszwo","id":907380,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNzM4MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/907380?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo","html_url":"https://github.com/szetszwo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-27T18:07:31Z","updated_at":"2022-07-27T18:07:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Since this is a doc change, I will merge this without re-running the failed tests.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/comments/1197118577/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
