For example: \r\n```\r\n$ wsk action list\r\nactions\r\n/guest/C\r\n/guest/A\r\n/guest/B\r\n```\r\nThis is how a list might look with the current build. `C` is the most recent action, hence being the first item in the list, and `B` being the oldest action. With alphabetize, it's obviously:\r\n```\r\n$ wsk action list\r\nactions\r\n/guest/A\r\n/guest/B\r\n/guest/C\r\n```\r\nHere's the problem that occurs if we include either `--skip` or `--limit`:\r\n```\r\n$ wsk action list --skip 1\r\nactions\r\n/guest/A\r\n/guest/B\r\n```\r\nNotice that `skip` took away the last item, not the first, since `C` was the newest action in the DB and would have been the first item in the list to skip before sorting. \r\n```\r\n$ wsk action list --limit 2\r\nactions\r\n/guest/A\r\n/guest/C\r\n```\r\nHere, because the limit is 2, but action `B` is outside of that range, it is ignored altogether. Now it looks like `B` doesn't exist. \r\n\r\nThese are the issues we were concerned with. And it only gets more complicated when you have larger and larger lists to print (@dubeejw first pointed this out with an example I can grab if you would like to discuss further).  The only way we are aware of to alleviate this issue is to stop the `limit` and `skip` flags from going to the server, grab all the data (however much that may be) for the list, sort the list, then implement the flags locally to our newly sorted list before printing.

Hence my point: don't over complicate it.\r\n\r\nThe API currently is what it is and it's still useful to sort action alphabetically. A user who wants to see more than 30 actions can bump the limit to 200. In that list the cli should show the result alphabetically. I don't think users will shrink the list but rather expand it.\r\n\r\nJust like in a shell you have ls and ls -t both are desired. The canonical ordering today is by time because it's uniform for all assets. \r\n\r\nI can envision that activations are sorted by time and everything else by name.

 \r\nI wonder if the documentation for how to set up the client based authentication \r\nbelongs in the same place our docs talk about ssl certificates in general \r\n- so that the CLI doc is strictly about the CLI not a deployment.\r\n```\r\nAnswer: openwhisk itself doens't care how to generate client certificate(genssh.sh just an example), it just provide a entry point configuration to how to use it, so openwhisk users(for example:a company) just configure `nginx.ssl.client_ca_cert` to `their own client ca path`,  and create every client certificate(cert/key) for its employees.\r\n\r\nSo employee can download its own client certificate(cert/key) from somewhere(may be download url),\r\nand use `wsk -i property set --cert <cert> --key <key> XXX` can access openwhisk env.\r\n\r\nSo i will improve the docs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/317988650/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/318041237","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/2517#issuecomment-318041237","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/2517","id":318041237,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxODA0MTIzNw==","user":{"login":"mdeuser","id":18535381,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTM1Mzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18535381?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser","html_url":"https://github.com/mdeuser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-26T12:41:48Z","updated_at":"2017-07-26T12:41:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"When
