And use Arthas tool to analyze the CPU usage. Here is my conclusion:\r\n\r\n1. With heartbeat_interval_ms=100, the MetaHeartbeatThread and DataHeartbeatThread cost <0.1% CPU. And with heartbeat_interval_ms=1000, they cost <0.01% CPU. There's no significant impaction if we decrease the heartbeat interval.\r\n2. Under no outer pressure environment, with heartbeat_interval_ms=100, the headertbeatThread CPU cost about 34.09% of the whole IoTDB program cost. And with heartbeat_interval_ms=1000, the percentage is 1.27%. Because CPU cost in total is very low, the percentage difference is huge.\r\n\r\nI think the side effect of CPU is acceptable.\r\n\r\nAttachments for reference:\r\n1. hb-dashboard-100.png: The

Because I didn't have a very deep understanding of `raft` and `etcd` at that time, after a long period, I finally realized that this was probably an awful implementation and I apologize for that. There are two main reasons:\r\n> \r\n> * For `raft`, uncommitted logs also need to be persisted (i.e., logs on disk may also need to be truncated) in order to ensure correctness after reboot.\r\n> * `etcd` is an event-driven architecture, so its interior is all unlocked. However, in our architecture, `raftLogManager` can be accessed concurrently by multiple threads. So we've added a lot of patches for concurrency control right now, but this is actually an area we can think about implementing better.\r\n> \r\n> Thank you very much for your great contributions. This week I will focus on the PR you raised about `cluster-` branch and a bug at hand. After that, I would like to discuss the refactoring of `raftLogManager` with you guys and community. And of course you're welcome to start to design the new `raftLogManager` with us right now if you are free.\r\n\r\nIMO，we need the following two approaches in parallel:\r\n\r\n- First,we should solve this problem in the current code structure and submit to `master` and `rel/0.12.x` branch. Because when a user has a problem like mine, it's hard to solve immediately, this means that some data could be loss, and cluster may enter an unstable state.This is a disaster for the production environment.We need to provide users with a patch to avoid this problem.\r\n- Second,we can refactor this part on `cluster-` branch.Once we have solved the first problem, we can spend more time refactoring this part better.  And we don't have to push this part of the content to the user immediately.It can be put into the next release as a better implementation.\r\n\r\nI'd be happy to do it together   : )","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/917804418/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/917806947","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iotdb/pull/3939#issuecomment-917806947","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/3939","id":917806947,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCXnElM42tJ9j","user":{"login":"OneSizeFitsQuorum","id":32640567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjQwNTY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32640567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OneSizeFitsQuorum","html_url":"https://github.com/OneSizeFitsQuorum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OneSizeFitsQuorum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OneSizeFitsQuorum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OneSizeFitsQuorum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OneSizeFitsQuorum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OneSizeFitsQuorum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OneSizeFitsQuorum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OneSizeFitsQuorum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OneSizeFitsQuorum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OneSizeFitsQuorum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-13T03:24:23Z","updated_at":"2021-09-13T03:24:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":" \r\n> I'd be happy to do it together : )\r\n\r\nOK, then that's my reviews~At current, it seems that the `getAllEntriesAfterCommittedIndex()` will always return empty list in current design?
