Agreed that more intelligence can be added based on access type. Considering this is in SPI and injecting config is not easy, can we set up some singleton MMAPConfigRegistry so that the value can be easily configurable in the server scope? Feel free to suggest cleaner ways. @dinoocch @vvivekiyer @ankitsultana

Is there a rough design doc / high level idea that can be shared to understand the semantics of how this will look in storage and query wise ?\n> \n> Are we planning to store this as a raw blob / binary bytes in forward index ?\n\nThanks Sid! Wilk share a design doc soon. The basic idea here is to store map of key to any primitive types using forward index. \n\nAnd later on we can add more index support for map item function based on the density etc ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2282256736/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2282268238","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/13773#issuecomment-2282268238","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/13773","id":2282268238,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c6ICKZO","user":{"login":"siddharthteotia","id":2150694,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTA2OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2150694?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia","html_url":"https://github.com/siddharthteotia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-10T20:21:45Z","updated_at":"2024-08-10T20:21:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@hpvd  @abhioncbr - I have been very interested in exploring more wide and holistic use of SIMD in Pinot.

Yes let's do some survey\r\n\r\n> https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson-java\r\n\r\nThis is based on incubator version of vector support in JDK (Project Panama by Open JDK AFAIK). Note that the package still says \"incubator\" so I am not sure of production use / support for this. We have done this in the past where we took a dependency on less than productionized library (Lbuffer) and it proved to be unstable once in a while.

We can also build a JNI bridge ourselves. \r\n\r\nI think the investment really depends on some value via POC.\r\n\r\nCurious if @gortiz  / @richardstartin  have any advice / suggestions.

Last month in JCrete we were discussing about how to access native code efficiently and it looks like nothing has changed (yet). Calling JNI/Panama code per row is prohibitively slow. The good news is that in single-stage engine and in the leaf stages in multi-stage engine these calls can be done at block level, so we should be able to absorb the cost of the JNI call.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2283201114/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2283409218","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/11701#issuecomment-2283409218","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/11701","id":2283409218,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c6IGg9C","user":{"login":"gortiz","id":1913993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MTM5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1913993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz","html_url":"https://github.com/gortiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-12T08:43:33Z","updated_at":"2024-08-12T08:43:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> While upgrading Spark 3.3.0 to 3.5.0 facing errors. { using java 17 , scala 2.13} for building spark 3.5.0\r\nstep to produce error..\r\n>\r\n> clone spark 3.5.0 from apache spark github\r\n> Go to spark directory and run the command. ----> ./build/mvn -DskipTests clean package\r\n\r\nI don't think we compile Spark our self.

IMO that is not always improve the readability, because we tend to put relevant fields/methods next to each other.\r\nCan you re-apply the changes but disable that option?\r\n\r\nDone! Not rearranging code makes sense. Removing that option, makes very few changes. I included few more files in these set of changes for now. Thanks!

in the realtime segment commit path. The other factor was, for now disabling it would never be used except for a Lucene text indexed column since no other indexes can be reused (and it's debatable how much improvement reusing others could bring, since the Lucene based index is comparatively expensive to create). Is the complexity worth it? Since even though the feature is generic the implementation would entirely support Lucene text index only and it seems unlikely other indexes will benefit in near future.\r\n\r\nI don't have the answer, but since we haven't marked `noRawDataForTextIndex` as deprecated, to me this seemed like a simpler implementation that solved our immediate needs and brings an overall improvement","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2287205289/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2287218913","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/13659#issuecomment-2287218913","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/13659","id":2287218913,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c6IVDDh","user":{"login":"Jackie-Jiang","id":17555551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTU1NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17555551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang","html_url":"https://github.com/Jackie-Jiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-13T22:03:56Z","updated_at":"2024-08-13T22:03:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Can you elaborate more on the problem?
