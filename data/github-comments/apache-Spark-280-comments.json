@YanTangZhai I think that this patch introduced a bug in `Utils.getLocalDir()`.  Currently, that function assumes that all of the directories in `spark.local.dir` exist and returns the first directory from that list:\n\n``` scala\n  /**\n   * Get a temporary directory using Spark's spark.local.dir property, if set. This will always\n   * return a single directory, even though the spark.local.dir property might be a list of\n   * multiple paths.\n   */\n  def getLocalDir(conf: SparkConf): String = {\n    conf.get(\"spark.local.dir\", System.getProperty(\"java.io.tmpdir\")).split(',')(0)\n  }\n```\n\nAfter this patch, the first directory might be missing, which can lead to confusing errors when we try to create files in it.\n\nHow should we fix this?  Maybe have the disk manager be the authoritative source of local directories and update all other code to use it rather than the raw `spark.local.dir` property?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51537965/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51538148","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1842#issuecomment-51538148","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1842","id":51538148,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNTM4MTQ4","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-07T21:59:28Z","updated_at":"2014-08-07T21:59:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA tests have started for PR 1842.

It's just an extra step and it makes it much harder to report problems. From my point of view:\n- The executor logs can remain at INFO and contain what they have now; you only look at those if you had a problem\n- The driver could be less verbose; we can eventually put it on WARN, but for now we should at least reduce their verbosity. For example long-term we might make spark-shell launch with WARN while executors launch with INFO.\n\nAlso IMO it's too late to change this stuff for 1.1; this is a pretty big change. We can look at it for 1.2 though, and I'd also be okay removing a few noisy log messages for 1.1.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51552785/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51552928","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1776#issuecomment-51552928","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1776","id":51552928,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNTUyOTI4","user":{"login":"mateiz","id":228859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODg1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz","html_url":"https://github.com/mateiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-08T01:13:24Z","updated_at":"2014-08-08T01:13:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"BTW the problem is not \"does it work as expected in most cases\", it's \"is it easy to debug when it's not working as expected\".
