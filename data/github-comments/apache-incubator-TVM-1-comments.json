level graph description lanugage\r\n   - NNVM, HLO, NGraph\r\n   - It is close enough to the first one that you can also build graph optimization on first layer and bypass this layer\r\n- 3 DSL for description and codegen.\r\n- 4 Hardcoded optimized kernel library like nnpack, cudnn, libdnn\r\n- 5 Device dependent library\r\n\r\nMost libraries goes with 1 -> 4. An easy and restrictive path for compilation and fusion is going from 2 -> 4/5, by manually code up fused kernels, or have rules to generate certain fused kernels. TVM sits on level 3, to make jump from level 2 to level 5 easier and give user more control.\r\n\r\nIn terms of design philosophy, we want to make it work together with existing ecosystem. This include\r\n- Friendly frontend that can be directly used for kernel generation\r\n- Give framework full control of memory allocation, graph execution, data layout etc.\r\n- Generate DLPack compatible kernels that every framework can directly take.\r\n- Make use of blackbox calls like cudnn when user says so.\t\r\n\r\nI think we can expect all approaches in the stack will continue to exist. We just design a layer in 3 that can  incrementally transit toward automation while still being able to transparently benefit from things in 4.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/303152024/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/303334022","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/149#issuecomment-303334022","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/149","id":303334022,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMzMzNDAyMg==","user":{"login":"yajiedesign","id":771744,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MTc0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/771744?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yajiedesign","html_url":"https://github.com/yajiedesign","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yajiedesign/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yajiedesign/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yajiedesign/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yajiedesign/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yajiedesign/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yajiedesign/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yajiedesign/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yajiedesign/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yajiedesign/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-23T08:52:19Z","updated_at":"2017-05-23T08:52:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Do
