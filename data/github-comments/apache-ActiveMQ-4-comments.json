So if we get those changes into the samples then I think we can go ahead and merge this.  The delivery count bit is interesting but seemingly unrelated at this point to the examples.  That's something we could dig into in another issue, I'm not sure right now what is triggering it to behave that way.  At fist I thought it could be a bug in the lastDeliveredSequenceId tracking bits in the broker side session handler but given that the last message arrives without a delivery count I'm a bit stumped at the moment on what is going on.

I understand some of the reasons in the features.xml, but I don't understand why you are creating a new activemq-client-osgi jar.

All the other imports and everything seem to be the same (ish, some of the ranges are missing).      I don't see the point of that so would be -1 to creating another bundle for that.
