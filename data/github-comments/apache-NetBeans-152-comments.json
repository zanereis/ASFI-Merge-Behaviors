So I had a look at it and from my POV it is broken now:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<persistence xmlns=\"https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence\" \r\n             xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\r\n             version=\"3.1\" \r\n             xsi:schemaLocation=\"https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence/persistence_3_1.xsd\"\r\n             >\r\n\t<!--  Define Persistence Unit  -->\r\n\t<persistence-unit name=\"my_persistence_unit\"> </persistence-unit>\r\n</persistence>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe issue is the fourth line (I added linebreaks). The schema location points into the void. Try to open `https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence/persistence_3_1.xsd`, you'll get a 404 which defeats the purpose of `xsi:schemaLocation`.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be still in discussion:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/jakartaee/persistence/issues/372 (the discussion seems to be ongoing)\r\n- https://github.com/jakartaee/persistence/pull/373 is unanswered after about a year\r\n\r\nFrom my POV 3.1 is broken. The [3.0](https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence/persistence_3_0.xsd) schema can't be applied as it requires a fixed version of `3.0` and there is no other.

Do you mean, starting Wildfly manually and passing the port-offset as parameter? If so, that would not make sense, as the whole point is that NetBeans starts the server and passes everything in.\r\n\r\n> I don't understand why you don't set the proper port value per server instance.\r\n\r\nYes, I could do that. But the port offset in the `standalone.xml` applies to more ports than admin and HTTP. As NetBeans only allows to set admin and HTTP port, I'd have to remove the port offset in the config file and add it to the other ports by hand. That is inconvenient and makes the port offset variable pointless.\r\nUnfortunately I have to deal with several Widlfy instances of different versions and just setting the port offset in the config makes it easier to have them running in parallel. \r\n\r\nProbably the best is to scrap my commits and add a new field in the server wizard where one can specify the port offset, which is then passed to Wildfly via `-Djboss.socket.binding.port-offset=Y`. I am not keen on doing Swing stuff so I tried to fix the problem with the commits you checked. \r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1434905028/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1434911570","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/5505#issuecomment-1434911570","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5505","id":1434911570,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5VhwNS","user":{"login":"vieiro","id":564140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NDE0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/564140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro","html_url":"https://github.com/vieiro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-17T16:53:17Z","updated_at":"2023-02-17T16:53:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Readability is, [by definition](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/readability) a subjective concept.
