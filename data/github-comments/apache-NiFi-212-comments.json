I'm cool with a different approach too.\r\n\r\nThanks for the feedback @joewitt. I agree from reading some reference that the performance benefits should be more noticeable around large numbers of connections, so that's just where I would like to see a bit more comparison between Java 21 NIO and the native transports. With JDK improvements, perhaps the differences are not as noticeable, or only noticeable in certain circumstances. That's where having more recent and substantive examples would be helpful.\r\n\r\nI'm not favor of a profile-based approach, because that would make the code more complicated, not being able to compile as it stands, if the libraries were not included. This could certainly be implemented using reflection, but as a non-default profile, I expect it would be minimally used.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, I think this could still be valuable, I would just like to see some type of scenario in NiFi, or benchmarks from other systems on Java 21, that illustrate the benefits.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2181963480/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2182301709","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/8975#issuecomment-2182301709","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/8975","id":2182301709,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM6CE0gN","user":{"login":"ferencerdei","id":89379649,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5Mzc5NjQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89379649?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferencerdei","html_url":"https://github.com/ferencerdei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferencerdei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferencerdei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferencerdei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferencerdei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferencerdei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferencerdei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferencerdei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferencerdei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferencerdei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-21T08:46:38Z","updated_at":"2024-06-21T08:46:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the fix, merging","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2182301709/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2182421985","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/8992#issuecomment-2182421985","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/8992","id":2182421985,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM6CFR3h","user":{"login":"MikeThomsen","id":108184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODE4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen","html_url":"https://github.com/MikeThomsen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-21T09:55:30Z","updated_at":"2024-06-21T09:55:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@exceptionfactory Alright.

I can appreciate the intent.  That said I do agree with the response of @exceptionfactory.\r\n\r\nA couple things at play.  First is related to the maintainability of the Kafka components.  We should be getting rid of the Kafka 2.x components soon in favor of Kafka 3.7/latest or even 4.0 as it will be out very soon.  There is a long standing active effort to refactor the Kafka processors underway as well.  And of course this is just consume kafka and we also have record oriented processors as well.  We can't have behavior deviating too far.\r\n\r\nSecondarily there is then the question of this change relative to the purpose of the processor.  That processor is written as a source component and designed as such.  Switching to allow it to accept flowfiles as input which are effectively signals to change which topic(s) it pays attention to is likely not producing enough of a clear user experience improvement.\r\n\r\nAs I read this it means the input flowfiles act as signals/switches to change which topic is being monitored.  In your intent/flow how will that really work in terms of 'what' creates the input flowfiles and at what rate will new flowfiles arrive?  What happens if a new flowfile comes in and there is still more to read on the topic(s) in question/etc.? \r\n\r\nThis is too complex as-is for a user and changes an otherwise extremely critical/common use component.\r\n\r\nTo be clear i'm not rejecting the idea.  You may well be on to something.  I suggest it is offered with a more detailed writeup of the 'why' and how it would work in practice/is intended to work.  Then a component that is specific to this DynamicConsumeKafka* pattern.  This way we can all offer thoughts on the first part before having to react to the code.\r\n\r\nThe writeup on the JIRA is a good start but what it lacks is a discussion/description around 'what and how' signaling of topic changes would occur.  We need to understand more of that intent/picture.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2183049044/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2183121318","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/8990#issuecomment-2183121318","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/8990","id":2183121318,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM6CH8mm","user":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-21T17:04:44Z","updated_at":"2024-06-21T17:04:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 LGTM, had to change Set.of() for backport but merging to support/nifi-1.x and main.

for the follow up @MikeThomsen.\r\n\r\nIncorporating new Processors and refactoring in the same pull request for S3 doesn't sound ideal, and I agree that the scope of these Processors is fairly narrow in terms of S3 API changes. With that in mind, considering these Processors as they stand seems like a reasonable way forward.\r\n\r\nTo that end, there are a few things I recommend evaluating. The Copy Processor seems straightforward, and I can take a closer look at potential changes there. I would note that new properties should just use a human-readable `name()` instead of a different `displayName()` going forward.\r\n\r\nOn the Exists Processor, I think it would be better to have it function as a `GetS3ObjectMetadata` Processor. The `doesObjectExist()` method requests the metadata, but ignores the response. I think having the metadata would present other potential uses beyond just whether the object exists, while still supporting that particular use case.

This is probably worth considering in a discussion in Jira, where it would be helpful to outline the type of Processor to be developed. It is worth noting that a large number of the `List` Processors in Java have the `TriggerSerially` annotation, so it might even make sense to make that the standard behavior. However, I think this can be considered as a follow-on effort, as the implications may be a bit different given the relationship between Java Threads and Python processes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2194611673/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2194751134","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/9000#issuecomment-2194751134","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/9000","id":2194751134,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM6C0T6e","user":{"login":"pgyori","id":63872658,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzODcyNjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63872658?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgyori","html_url":"https://github.com/pgyori","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgyori/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgyori/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgyori/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgyori/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgyori/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgyori/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgyori/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgyori/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgyori/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-27T13:54:39Z","updated_at":"2024-06-27T13:54:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Hey @pgyori 👋 Just out of curiosity - have you thought about offering a version of the `FlowFileSourceProxy` for processors that are **not** safe for concurrent execution?\r\n> \r\n> Currently there is no way of setting annotations such as `@TriggerSerially `from the Python side - most regular processors are fine with 'Concurrent Tasks' > 1 but I have several source processors I would like to develop where running multiple concurrent tasks would be rather ... problematic 😇\r\n\r\nHi @henrikjohansen ,\r\nThat is a very interesting - and challenging - problem.

I simply have been for quite some time not recommending it. As long as people keep adding features and improvements to 1.x more than they focus on getting 2.0 done then it gets harder and harder to get 2.x done.  What you focus on and wish to happen will happen.  What you wait for....may not.  Bottom line I am in the hearts and minds business.  I recommend and encourage folks focus on the go forward solution.  The 1.x line is great but it is already experiencing atrophy.  I strongly believe our best way to help/support/grow the community is to look forward.  This is just my view - you'll get an impressive amount of opinions on such a topic.

The component description notes that it does not perform any email validation, which effectively requires an external SMTP server for runtime use. Running ListenSMTP with direct network exposure is very dangerous, so its current use cases are limited.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2211306420/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2211324768","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/9049#issuecomment-2211324768","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/9049","id":2211324768,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM6DziNg","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-05T19:30:55Z","updated_at":"2024-07-05T19:30:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Merged
