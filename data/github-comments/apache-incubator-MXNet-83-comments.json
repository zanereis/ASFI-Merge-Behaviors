One comment on using (axis==-1) as summing over all. \n- This can be a bit incompatible with numpy's behavior on allowing axis to be negative. Although this is a minor thing, we might want to think a bit on how it can be avoided for future compatiblity.\n- One way we can do is to support a nullable type in int setting. So user can pass in axis=None, while it get parsed as a special integer setted through configuration. \n\nLet me know about your
