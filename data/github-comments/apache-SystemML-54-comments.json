thanks for creating the builtin function and test @tim-sagaster.

First, I fixed the test to use a relatively large epsilon so it passes (so far it compared equivalence of doubles which even for tiny discrepancies would fail; it seems ok, but there are a few values where the absolute error goes up to 10% of the value range; we will follow up to understand the algorithm-level differences; also, for iterative algorithms it's not useful to force all operations into distributed Spark ops so nothing to worry there).

For local CP and distributed Spark operations we actually decide based on estimated sparsity if we do a sparse hash aggregation or an accumulation into a dense matrix. Likely the federated ctable operations was implemented for correctness so far. In your experiments, however, please test both sparse ctable scenario (like creating permutation matrices) and dense scenarios (like confusion matrices with moderate number of classes). In any case, the revised change is much better, because the previous commit affected the defaults, partially without considering the value, and unintended sparse accumulation can be vastly slower due to binary search and potential shifting. But you're right reevaluated these defaults (e.g., with our revived perftest suite). This reminds me, if feel it's beneficial, please add your federated algorithm tests to this perftest so we can automatically run them before releases.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/898735466/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/899865720","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/1365#issuecomment-899865720","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1365","id":899865720,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArxUbc41otx4","user":{"login":"atefeh-asayesh","id":83871787,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzODcxNzg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/83871787?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/atefeh-asayesh","html_url":"https://github.com/atefeh-asayesh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atefeh-asayesh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atefeh-asayesh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atefeh-asayesh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atefeh-asayesh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atefeh-asayesh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atefeh-asayesh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atefeh-asayesh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atefeh-asayesh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atefeh-asayesh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-16T22:44:26Z","updated_at":"2021-08-16T22:44:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Draft- Some small changes would be done.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/899865720/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/900620993","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/1366#issuecomment-900620993","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1366","id":900620993,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArxUbc41rmLB","user":{"login":"Baunsgaard","id":9947148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5NDcxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9947148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard","html_url":"https://github.com/Baunsgaard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-17T20:50:29Z","updated_at":"2021-08-17T20:50:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I don't think it is needed to add the header to the file csv file.

To make the rewrite better i could include a cost of the matrix multiplication for cbind before vs after. this would make the rewrite more stable.\r\nAlternatively i think what i am going to do is to set the `hi.getDim1() > hi.getDim2() * 2` to something like `hi.getDim1() > hi.getDim2() * 100`, since this still tricker the rewrite in the place intended, and is less prone to executing the rewrite in bad locations. (not that it matters much it is a very specific rewrite.)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/915556882/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/915559306","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/1385#issuecomment-915559306","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1385","id":915559306,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArxUbc42klOK","user":{"login":"mboehm7","id":13721609,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzIxNjA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13721609?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7","html_url":"https://github.com/mboehm7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-08T20:48:15Z","updated_at":"2021-09-08T20:48:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"no, you misunderstood my main comment - we need to compare m vs n (and apparently that's what you wanted to do), but what the code does is to compare m vs (k+1) because you look at rows and columns of the output cbind (variable hi) - simply replace `hi.getDim2()` with `hi.getInput(1).getDim1()`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/915559306/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/915865124","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/1381#issuecomment-915865124","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1381","id":915865124,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArxUbc42lv4k","user":{"login":"sebwrede","id":32260341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjYwMzQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32260341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebwrede","html_url":"https://github.com/sebwrede","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebwrede/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebwrede/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebwrede/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebwrede/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebwrede/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebwrede/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebwrede/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebwrede/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebwrede/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-09T08:14:00Z","updated_at":"2021-09-09T08:14:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Do you know if it was overwritten on purpose?

Thanks @fathollahzadeh - that's a good first step and we can bring it in as experimental after some additional cleanups (dependencies, imports). As next steps we should run some experiments for better understanding the runtime breakdown, and then generalize the hard-coded readers to code-generated reads that utilize sub-templates for key concepts.\r\n\r\nThanks @mboehm7 for the first review and your supports. The new updates are supporting auto-generate readers for Matrix and Frame. In matrix readers, we are supporting general, symmetric (upper, lower triangular), and skew-symmetric. At this PR we do not support pattern matching. For Frame readers, we are supporting three value types (STRING, Numeric, and BOOLEAN). Unknown value types in Frame are our future work. \r\nFor the test side, we don't have any DML scripts. We are calling pure java public methods for generating readers. The new DML script is also our future work. \r\n\r\nThanks for the review. \r\n  \r\n

I think it is because of MatrixObject.java:438, where an `acquireReadAndRelease()` call is made when the matrix object is federated. This does not work when it has to read from HDFS. I am not entirely sure how your changes causes this, but we need to change it so that it does not call `acquireReadAndRelease()` whenever the data is federated. It should instead make some check to see if it needs to call `DataConverter.readMatrixFromHDFS` even if the object itself is federated.

The script generates the data, creates a specific amount (in our case 5) of federated worker processes on localhost, splits the data into partitions, creates a federated object from the different partitions and workers, runs the ALS-CG algorithm with the federated object as data input, and kills the woker processes again. I tried to make the shell scripts for starting and killing the federated workers, and also the dml script for splitting the data and creating a federated object, as general as possible so that the same scripts can be used the further federated performance tests.\r\n> \r\n> Thanks for review :)\r\n\r\nThanks for this PR!\r\n\r\nI ran the performance test and have two comments: \r\n\r\n1. I get the following message continuously during the execution: `TRACE nio.NioEventLoop: instrumented a special java.util.Set into: sun.nio.ch.EPollSelectorImpl@`. Do you have any idea why this happens and how to fix it? \r\n2. The script prints `Max iteration achieved but not converged!`. Could we increase the maximum number of iterations or change something else to make sure that it reaches its target? Otherwise it is difficult to determine from the prints whether the algorithm actually succeeded or if it was even close to succeeding.
