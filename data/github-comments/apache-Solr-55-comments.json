message is listed in the JTS changelog). Since 1.17.0 appears to be the version used for testing Lucene and there are API changes both from 1.16 to 1.17 and from 1.17 to 1.18 then using anything other than 1 1.17.x seems risky to me.\r\n\r\nAgree with the other comments though regarding bundling a current version of JTS if possible in future.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1951776336/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1951787674","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2273#issuecomment-1951787674","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2273","id":1951787674,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM50Veqa","user":{"login":"ejn","id":1106824,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDY4MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1106824?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejn","html_url":"https://github.com/ejn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-19T06:29:33Z","updated_at":"2024-02-19T06:29:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Note that currently Spatial4J 0.9-SNAPSHOT declares JTS 1.18.1 in its pom.xml - the last release of Spatial4J was however 0.8 back in 2020.

It configures a scheduled task to periodically check and delete these shards, thereby helping in maintaining the health and efficiency of the Solr cluster.\n- **Type of PR:** Enhancement\n- **[Score ](https://docs.bito.ai/bito-dev-agents/ai-code-review-agent/faqs#what-is-pr-quality-score-in-code-review-output)(0-100, higher is better):** 85\n- **Relevant tests added:** Yes\n- **[Estimated effort to review ](https://docs.bito.ai/bito-dev-agents/ai-code-review-agent/faqs#what-is-estimated-effort-to-review-in-code-review-output)(1-5, lower is better):** 2\nThe PR is well-structured with a clear purpose. It includes tests which should make the review process straightforward. However, the complexity of the changes and the potential impact on cluster behavior necessitate a thorough review.\n## PR Feedback\n\n- **General suggestions:** The implementation of the InactiveShardRemover as a Cluster Singleton for removing inactive shards after a TTL is a valuable addition to Solr's maintenance capabilities. The approach of scheduling periodic checks to remove expired shards can help in keeping the cluster lean and efficient. However, it's crucial to ensure that the removal process does not inadvertently affect the cluster's stability or data integrity. To further enhance this feature, consider implementing safety checks that prevent the removal of shards if they are temporarily marked as inactive due to network partitions or other transient issues. Additionally, providing more configurability for the TTL and deletion criteria could allow administrators to tailor the feature to their specific needs. Finally, extensive testing in simulated production environments is recommended to ensure that the feature behaves as expected under various failure scenarios.\n## Code feedback\n\n## file: solr/core/src/java/org/apache/solr/cluster/maintenance/InactiveShardRemover.java\n\n- **Suggestions:**\n\n\n\n 1. Consider implementing a dry-run mode that logs which shards would be deleted without actually performing the deletion. This can be useful for administrators to safely test the impact of the InactiveShardRemover on their cluster. [important] **Relevant line**:In solr/core/src/java/org/apache/solr/cluster/maintenance/InactiveShardRemover.java at line 85\n ```\n+ implements ClusterSingleton, ConfigurablePlugin<InactiveShardRemoverConfig> {\n ```\n\n\n 2. Add metrics or logging to track the number of shards checked and deleted per cycle. This can help in monitoring the effectiveness of the plugin and troubleshooting issues. [important] **Relevant line**:In solr/core/src/java/org/apache/solr/cluster/maintenance/InactiveShardRemover.java at line 176\n ```\n+ inactiveSlices.stream().limit(maxDeletesPerCycle).forEach(this::deleteShard);\n ```\n\n\n 3. Ensure that the scheduled executor service is properly managed to avoid potential memory leaks. Consider using a try-with-resources statement or similar mechanism to ensure that resources are freed up. [important] **Relevant line**:In solr/core/src/java/org/apache/solr/cluster/maintenance/InactiveShardRemover.java at line 132\n ```\n+ executor = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1, new SolrNamedThreadFactory(PLUGIN_NAME));\n ```\n\n\n 4. Consider adding a feature to notify administrators before deleting shards, possibly through email or a dashboard notification. This could provide an additional layer of safety before data deletion occurs. [medium] **Relevant line**:In solr/core/src/java/org/apache/solr/cluster/maintenance/InactiveShardRemover.java at line 190\n ```\n+ private void deleteShard(final Slice s) {\n ```\n## file: solr/core/src/java/org/apache/solr/cluster/maintenance/InactiveShardRemoverConfig.java\n\n- **Suggestions:**\n\n\n\n 1. Validate configuration parameters (e.g., scheduleIntervalSeconds, ttlSeconds, maxDeletesPerCycle) to ensure they are within reasonable limits. This can prevent misconfigurations that could lead to aggressive shard deletions or performance issues. [important] **Relevant line**:In solr/core/src/java/org/apache/solr/cluster/maintenance/InactiveShardRemoverConfig.java at line 47\n ```\n+ final long scheduleIntervalSeconds, final long ttlSeconds, final int maxDeletesPerCycle) {\n ```\n\n\n 2. Allow dynamic reconfiguration of the InactiveShardRemoverConfig without needing to restart the Solr cluster. This would enable administrators to adjust settings in response to the cluster's current state. [medium] **Relevant line**:In solr/core/src/java/org/apache/solr/cluster/maintenance/InactiveShardRemoverConfig.java at line 28\n ```\n+ public InactiveShardRemoverConfig() {\n ```\n## file: solr/core/src/test/org/apache/solr/cluster/maintenance/InactiveShardRemoverTest.java\n\n- **Suggestions:**\n\n\n\n 1. Expand test coverage to include scenarios where shards become inactive due to network partitions or other transient conditions. Ensure that the plugin does not delete these shards prematurely.
