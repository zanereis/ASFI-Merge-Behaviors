@jerrypeng  using second-person pronoun is ok with me. I just know from writing academic papers for IEEE or ACM conferences, we always use third person. I don't think I have ever read a academic paper written in second-person. Though our documentation doesn't need to be as formal as an academic paper.\r\n\r\nWhen we write academic paper, we use third person to indicate they are objective opinions. It's requirement of academic paper. When we write technical documentation (user manuals), our target readers are our users, we need adopt user-focus style, and involve them as much as possible. That's why we use second-person pronoun in technical writing.\r\nWhen you read user manuals at IEEE website, you will find that their user manuals also adopt second-person pronoun style. The following is an example from IEEE.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47805623/59401801-83787600-8dce-11e9-8516-dab1236bc81c.png)\r\nThis does not mean that technical documentation does not need to be as formal as an academic paper. They just adopt different writing styles, in order to achieve different goals.\r\nWhen you read Microsoft technical docs, you will find that they also adopt second-person pronoun.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47805623/59402063-92135d00-8dcf-11e9-8862-687a779e3fed.png)\r\n\r\n> Yes. In some places we use Pulsar Function (capital case \"f\") in other places we use Pulsar function (lowercase \"f\"). We probably should be consistent throughout our documentation, though I am not sure which is more appropriate, capital case \"f\" or lowercase \"f\".\r\n> \r\n> Though for Azure Functions, its documentation uses a capital case \"f\":\r\n> \r\n> https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/\r\n> \r\n\r\nThank you very much for your information. \"Function\" is really a challenging noun here. And I totally agree with you that we need keep it consistent throughout our docs.\r\n\r\nI read the Azure Functions doc you recommend, they use \"Functions\" and \"functions\" at the same time. I guess when they refer to \"Azure Functions/Durable Functions/Functions\" (as proper noun), they use the uppercase letter; when they refer to other functions (especially created by users), they use lowercase letter. \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47805623/59402346-7c526780-8dd0-11e9-91e4-022a7a8f4357.png)\r\nMy suggestion for Pulsar docs:\r\n1. When it refers to framework, we use \"Pulsar Functions\"(plural form and uppercase);\r\n2. When it refers to individual functions, we use \"function/functions\"(lowercase). For example, \"Java function\", \"You can create a function...\"\r\n\r\nOr could we ask others to discuss on this issue and decide how to use this word in our docs? After decision, I can update it throughout.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/501537238/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/501538011","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/4505#issuecomment-501538011","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/4505","id":501538011,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMTUzODAxMQ==","user":{"login":"liangyuanpeng","id":28711504,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NzExNTA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28711504?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyuanpeng","html_url":"https://github.com/liangyuanpeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyuanpeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyuanpeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyuanpeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyuanpeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyuanpeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyuanpeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyuanpeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyuanpeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyuanpeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-13T03:50:53Z","updated_at":"2019-06-13T03:52:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@sijie

thanks for information about how and when to use third and second person in technical writing.\r\n\r\nIn regards to \"Functions\" vs \"functions\", after examining Azure documentation in more detail, it uses capital \"f\" in \"functions\" when they are referring to the name of the product i.e. \"Azure Functions\" or \"Durable Functions\".  It uses a lower case \"f\" for \"function\" when referring to a general or common concept. \"Serverless functions\" is not a brand name, it is the term for a general concept/framework, thus I think it is spelled with a lower case \"f\".  \r\n\r\nI think its reasonable for us spell Pulsar Functions with a capital \"f\", when we are referring to this specific product/framework.
