In fact, I was maybe the loudest to say that the Monitor should go for 4.0. However, after giving this some more thought:\r\n\r\n  1. There is a real-world cost to setting up, running, and maintaining metric and log aggregation and display systems. For large installations, doing this likely makes sense. For smaller systems, or in cases where someone is trying to evaluate whether Accumulo is right for them, this could be a negative.\r\n  \r\n  2. One thing that I think the Monitor does well, is condensing a lot of information into tables. If you look at the Grafana Table [documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/panels-visualizations/visualizations/table/#supported-data-formats), for example, its supported formats are csv-like or a transformation on some query. The ability to do this via query, and the syntax used, would likely be dependent on the metric database being used. It's quite possible that a Table that we have on the Monitor today can't be built in the same way in Grafana or other monitoring systems.\r\n  \r\n  3. I have been putting some thought into how we might change the Monitor to display some of the new concepts that we have introduced, but using the Metrics that we generate instead of private information gathered via internal code that is funneled back to the Monitor via the Manager. If we did this in a kind of eat-your-own-dog-food type of way, then we could annotate (in a tool-tip?) which metrics were being used for the graph or table, so that a user trying to implement their own solution didn't have to guess which metrics made sense to go together.  We should also be able to determine which metrics are not really that useful, and which ones need to be added to create a new graph or table. In this case, the Monitor is the exemplar, and if it breaks down at some scale, so be it. We have given the user the documentation they need to build their own.\r\n  \r\n  Regarding Monitor changes:\r\n  \r\n  1. The External Compactions page needs to be removed, these are just major compactions now.\r\n  2. The main page might just be a summary of the resource groups. Type and number of server processes, how many are configured, active, and idle\r\n  3. We should likely have a page for each resource group\r\n  4. We likely want to remove OS-type things (e.g. OS load)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/2414541706/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/2414918297","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/4986#issuecomment-2414918297","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/4986","id":2414918297,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM6P8LqZ","user":{"login":"DomGarguilo","id":47725857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NzI1ODU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47725857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo","html_url":"https://github.com/DomGarguilo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-15T20:13:54Z","updated_at":"2024-10-15T20:13:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I added 9a218d6 to show how I was injecting the test data.

We discussed other means of accomplishing that, so I don't think this is really needed anymore, so unless I'm wrong about this, I don't think this alone adds any value to Accumulo.\r\n\r\nIf we are able to use the Thrift RPC for getting metrics *and* logs to the Monitor, then I agree that this is not needed.

Force use of TLS instead of making it configurable (use a generated self-signed cert by default, unless user configures one), to eliminate the complexity of supporting both TLS and non-TLS, then\r\n> 3. Force use of HTTP/2 (no fallback to HTTP/1.1), so there's no need to configure the extra factory, and no need for the configuration option or extra factory setup (all major browsers and CLI tools, like wget2 and cURL, support HTTP/2, so there's no reason to support HTTP/1.1)\r\n> \r\nI think there is still a case for HTTP/2 without TLS, even when used with a browser.

That case is when SSL termination is done at some proxy, with only http being used behind the proxy. If we still end up needing to do this, then we might need/want to account for this case.\r\n\r\nMy understanding is, based on everything I've read, that going through a proxy is specifically the case where HTTP/2 without TLS (h2c) tends to break, and why it's necessary to use only TLS with HTTP/2 for a passthrough proxy (using HTTP CONNECT). My understanding is further that a TLS terminating proxy would necessarily request HTTP/1.1 plaintext, or HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2 over TLS, depending if it supports TLS termination on both sides, but never HTTP/2 without TLS (h2c).\r\n\r\nSo, if we want to consider the TLS passthrough proxy case, then we don't need to support non-TLS, and can stick to just HTTP/2 over TLS. If we want to consider the TLS terminating proxy case, then it *might* support HTTP/2 over TLS if it's new enough (and if it supports TLS termination on both ends), but it definitely would support HTTP/1.1 without TLS. So even in that case, we don't need to support HTTP/2 without TLS (h2c).\r\n\r\nI'm not sure the exact situation you're thinking about, but I think it's worth noting that we don't do anything special to support either kinds of proxies today. If we want to continue to support the same kinds of use cases, we just need to continue to support HTTP/1.1 without TLS for the TLS terminating proxy case, and HTTP/2 with TLS would suffice for the TLS passthrough case, since the TCP connection is what is proxied via HTTP CONNECT, at a lower layer than the TLS and HTTP protocols.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/2418063534/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/2418123919","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/4879#issuecomment-2418123919","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/4879","id":2418123919,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM6QIaSP","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-16T23:15:33Z","updated_at":"2024-10-16T23:15:33Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I found the discussion on https://stackoverflow.com/q/71129297/196405 helpful to explain how HttpClient reuses (or doesn't) the connections.\r\n\r\nOne answer suggested `jdk.httpclient.connectionPoolSize` to limit the number of keep-alive connections, which is further documented at https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/core/java-networking.html\r\n\r\nAnother answer clarified that won't work, because it's only the limit of idle keep-alive connections, not the number of concurrent active ones. So, you have to limit it in the application. It says you also can't limit it by controlling the size of the executor's thread pool, because the client is fully async. They suggested using a Semaphore in the application to impose a max.\r\n\r\nIf the proposed implementation in https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/4982#issuecomment-2417960681 works, then we don't really have to fix this, but we'd have to change the implementation to collect the logs for later retrieval, as that comment proposes.\r\n\r\nHowever, my concern over that approach is that the current design allows other components to use this Appender. An implementation that queues the logs for later retrieval by the monitor via Thrift will not be able to be reused by other components, and that was one of my originally intended uses with the creation of this Appender. So, I'm not entirely sure what the best approach is here.\r\n\r\nIdeally, I would prefer to just eliminate log collection in the monitor entirely. Users who need to collect and monitor logs for alerting or later analysis should really be using a log collection and aggregation system that is appropriate for that, and we shouldn't be baking this into the monitor at all. Removing it entirely would save us a lot of grief.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/2418123919/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/2418143315","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/4879#issuecomment-2418143315","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/4879","id":2418143315,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM6QIfBT","user":{"login":"dlmarion","id":567911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NzkxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/567911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion","html_url":"https://github.com/dlmarion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-16T23:37:22Z","updated_at":"2024-10-16T23:37:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The comment in #4982 is on a PR for 3.1.

I don't think we should do what was suggested in that comment in 2.1... I wasn't careful about which branch I was referring to. We still need to constrain the number of connections in 2.1 based off the current design. My earlier comment was suggesting that we could fix it with a different design in newer Accumulo versions... however, I'm not a fan of the fact that it would restrict the Appender to only being usable by Accumulo itself (and specifically, servers that the accumulo-monitor knows to poll). When we spoke earlier today about that approach for metrics, I didn't consider that point. I also didn't consider that there would be additional complexity regarding how many logs to preserve per-server for retrieval by the monitor. Overall, I'd rather drop the feature than try to handle increasing complexity for something users shouldn't even be using (because it's an awful way to do log collection, analysis, or alerting).\r\n\r\n> If we need to support the current Appender, then we may want to look http/2 as a solution, as that allows for multiple concurrent requests over the same connection.

I discovered you can't upgrade a plaintext HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/2 using the \"Upgrade:\" header with POST calls, so this can't use HTTP/2 over plaintext anyway. We'd either have to use TLS on the monitor to get HTTP/2 or add in extra round-trip GET calls that we wait on to upgrade the connection before we can send POST. Furthermore, the \"h2c\" upgrade token to upgrade to HTTP/2 is obsoleted by the latest [HTTP/2 RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9113), so we should probably not start relying on it now.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/2418185962/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/2418191187","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/4982#issuecomment-2418191187","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/4982","id":2418191187,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM6QIqtT","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-17T00:09:33Z","updated_at":"2024-10-17T00:09:33Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"It looks like the the latest [HTTP/2 RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9113) obsoletes the \"h2c\" upgrade mechanism to upgrade over plaintext HTTP.

This would make managing it easier, but the primary downside is being unable to iterate over the timers to collect the current stats without locking. Right now with the separate map it's a concurrent hashmap so we can iterate and collect data as a snapshot in the memoized field and I think that makes it worthwhile to keep separate, even if it's more work to make things correct.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/2422698386/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/2422911383","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/4996#issuecomment-2422911383","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/4996","id":2422911383,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM6QarGX","user":{"login":"meatballspaghetti","id":69256191,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjU2MTkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69256191?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/meatballspaghetti","html_url":"https://github.com/meatballspaghetti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meatballspaghetti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meatballspaghetti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meatballspaghetti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meatballspaghetti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meatballspaghetti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meatballspaghetti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meatballspaghetti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meatballspaghetti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meatballspaghetti/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-18T17:15:41Z","updated_at":"2024-10-18T17:15:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Upgrader11to12Test has been fixed and passes now.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/2422911383/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/2422932584","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/4985#issuecomment-2422932584","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/4985","id":2422932584,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM6QawRo","user":{"login":"kevinrr888","id":43969518,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTY5NTE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43969518?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinrr888","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinrr888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinrr888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinrr888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinrr888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinrr888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinrr888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinrr888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinrr888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinrr888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinrr888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-18T17:29:53Z","updated_at":"2024-10-18T17:30:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@DomGarguilo just pointed me to this PR after I opened [issues/5001](https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/5001).

I think the switching cost of moving to Javelin are high, bring in a lot of new dependencies... on libraries written in a completely different programming language (Kotlin) that will be difficult for those unfamiliar to trace into for troubleshooting, if that becomes needed.\r\n\r\nI think I addressed this in my other comment, but since Javalin is a wrapper on top of Jetty, and it exposes all of the underlying Jetty controls, I don't think any of the points you raised regarding serving up static resources, TLS configuration, etc. are going to be an issue. I almost started with replacing the EmbeddedWebServer with Javalin completely, but then figured it would be better to keep them separate as it will be easier to remove the old monitor code once the new monitor is complete. The intention with this PR is to have two separate monitor (old and new) running off the same Monitor process until the new one is complete. All of this work could be done in a feature branch and *not* merged into `main`. @DomGarguilo's needs something that serves up the data to create the new UI.\r\n\r\n> It also isn't clear that the way it connects resources to endpoints is really all that much better or simpler than the JAX-RS specification that we get with Jersey annotations.\r\n\r\nI think it's simpler. With the current Monitor code you have to search for the class and method that has the matching path to understand which method is being called by the UI code. The way that the routes are built with Javalin, the mapping is centrally located in one place and can be made visible via the RouteOverview plugin to aid in debugging and development.\r\n\r\n> If we decide to expose the metrics directly from the servers, for general consumption by users who implement their own monitors, in order to get rid of our own monitor, a Javalin-based server might be a reasonable reference implementation. But, I don't think it should be part of these changes today.\r\n\r\nExposing metrics directly from the servers for general consumption was not something that was discussed. This exposes metrics from the servers for the purpose of serving data to the Monitor. The MetricServiceHandler class in this PR currently exposes all of the Accumulo application metrics as it's unknown at this point which metrics will be needed by the Monitor. Once we know what that set is, we can further reduce the set of metrics being exposed by the new Thrift endpoint.\r\n\r\n> Regarding flatbuffers, I'd really like to understand why you did that, since it seems to me that it's not providing anything we don't already get with Thrift directly, and it adds extra layers and dependencies. I'm not sure I understand the intent.\r\n\r\nI think I addressed this in my other comment.\r\n\r\n> For the core change of exposing the metrics via Thrift, I was only able to review at a glance, because it was hard to see what was part of that core change, and what was part of the other things in this PR... but the overall mechanism seemed okay. However, it still depends on the assumption that we should put full metrics on the monitor (rather than just a small curated set of health/status items on a custom API, and leaving it to the user to collect metrics for analysis using a dedicated metrics-specific system, if they need that, rather than try to get them via our lightweight monitor). \r\n\r\nThe intention is to just supply the metrics that are needed for the Monitor. Getting all of the metrics via a dedicated metrics system is the better and more complete solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n> Also, I was talking with @DomGarguilo earlier today and it occurred to me that it has happened a few times in the past that a user has come to us with an observation that the monitor is the only place where certain information exists, and as a solution, we've created public API methods to provide that information. So then I was wondering, instead of exposing a thrift RPC for metrics, that we use internally, maybe we should instead expose it as a public API, which the monitor can get directly from the AccumuloClient (it's own ServerContext). Then, anybody wanting to write their own monitor and expose the information differently, could just get the same information from the public API. This could be a step towards making the monitor an optional server that is merely another Accumulo client process. In the public API, we could also expose things that are not easily exposed in the metrics... like aggregated data per table or per tablet, which are not easily seen in the per-process metrics alone.\r\n\r\nI think the intention here is to build the new Monitor off of exposed metric information. If there is something new that is needed, then we should add the metric for it. This approach means that the Monitor is not getting special data that can't be retrieved or calculated by just getting the metrics via some MeterRegistry. I don't think we should expose this via the public API in the AccumuloClient, I think that's the wrong approach.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/2435066012/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/2435250066","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/5006#issuecomment-2435250066","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/5006","id":2435250066,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM6RJveS","user":{"login":"dlmarion","id":567911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NzkxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/567911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion","html_url":"https://github.com/dlmarion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-24T13:07:31Z","updated_at":"2024-10-24T13:07:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It seems like you answered my question - they are getting reported.

All of this work could be done in a feature branch and _not_ merged into `main`. @DomGarguilo's needs something that serves up the data to create the new UI.\r\n\r\nI don't think it's necessary to do that. The pages can be served from the same server. There's no need to run two. Also, I didn't think it was in scope to create a whole new monitor from scratch... I thought the goal was to do a comprehensive review of what's there, get rid of the bits we want to drop, and add stuff we think should be there. That doesn't require running two servers. We can build off of the previous work, the previous design, etc. That's what I had been discussing with @DomGarguilo. If your goal is to just create a monitor to view published metrics, I can see that being a standalone server, separate from the existing monitor, but I don't think it would be a replacement.\r\n\r\n> I think it's simpler. With the current Monitor code you have to search for the class and method that has the matching path to understand which method is being called by the UI code. The way that the routes are built with Javalin, the mapping is centrally located in one place and can be made visible via the RouteOverview plugin to aid in debugging and development.\r\n\r\nI think it's pretty easy to look at the `@Path` annotations to see the mappings. We used to have a centralized view, with servlets, and it got better when we switched to this. I think it might only look better now because the number of endpoints without a UI is still very small. Once that starts growing, and you start adding all the features back in that we want to keep from the old monitor, that's going to get quite cumbersome. Preferring one over the other may still be subjective. But even if there are some small style benefits, I still strongly prefer building off what we have, rather than make the lateral move, and add all the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n> I think the intention here is to build the new Monitor off of exposed metric information. If there is something new that is needed, then we should add the metric for it. This approach means that the Monitor is not getting special data that can't be retrieved or calculated by just getting the metrics via some MeterRegistry. I don't think we should expose this via the public API in the AccumuloClient, I think that's the wrong approach.\r\n\r\nI think the fundamental difference in our perspective on this is that you seem to see the monitor as a way to get some metrics information about the system. And, I see it as a way to get an overview of the system's deployed state and current activity. Some of the deployed state and current activity can be viewed as metrics, but some of it simply can't be. There isn't a metric for instanceName or instanceId, for example, or list of tables, or list of resource groups, or list of zookeepers the system is configured with, or whether a table is currently \"offline\" or \"disabled\". These kinds of things are status things that don't make sense as metrics, but are instead retrieved from the public API. So, I absolutely think that the monitor does have a need of getting data that can't be retrieved or calculated by just getting the metrics via some MeterRegistry. To the extent that the monitor is showing stuff that is specifically metrics, or can be metrics, I think the monitor should do very little of that, and instead rely on the user's use of a dedicated metrics collection/aggregation/alerting/visualization thing. If that's the kind of thing you're trying to prototype here, I think that's fine, but perhaps it shouldn't have anything to do with the monitor at all? Or, to the extent that it is, it's a very specific page on the monitor, separate from the non-metrics stuff. So, I think we should discuss what the actual goal is here, because it currently feels like \"metrics\" is being used as a hammer to hit every nail, when a lot of the monitor isn't actually a nail... some of it is, and for that stuff, it's probably useful to prototype that like you're doing in this PR... but not all of it is.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/2436221491/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/2436268653","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/5003#issuecomment-2436268653","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/5003","id":2436268653,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM6RNoJt","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-24T20:21:05Z","updated_at":"2024-10-24T20:21:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Discussed this with @dlmarion  and @ddanielr .

I think we should try to convey as much of that information as possible as metrics, and then add the remaining information to the MetricsResponse as non-metrics. Certainly the Manager could emit a metric for the number of tablets per table, from which we could create a list of tables. The nice thing about capturing most things as metrics is that we don't need two different code paths to capture the information about the system. If the monitor can run mostly off the metrics, then the monitor is optional as a user could decide to create their own monitor using some enterprise level monitoring system.\r\n\r\n> To the extent that the monitor is showing stuff that is specifically metrics, or can be metrics, I think the monitor should do very little of that, and instead rely on the user's use of a dedicated metrics collection/aggregation/alerting/visualization thing.

I realize that not everything is a metric, but if your idea is that the Monitor should show non-metrics, what is it showing?

To the extent that it's showing detailed metrics, I would prefer to leave those off the monitor entirely, leaving it to the user to plug into the metrics system directly for those. But, I think the real value of the monitor is the ability to have a big picture view of the system as a whole, and most of that doesn't come from the metrics. Sure, some can be powered by metrics, but that alone doesn't warrant a complete redesign. I don't think we should redesign the front end, except to determine which pages we want to keep, and which we want to lose, which we want to change, and which we want to lose. Powering the monitor with data collected from the metrics system doesn't require a complete overhaul, and I don't think we need a complete overhaul... changing the data source behind the scenes should be a largely invisible change to users.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/2436336629/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/2436373746","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/5012#issuecomment-2436373746","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/5012","id":2436373746,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM6ROBzy","user":{"login":"dlmarion","id":567911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NzkxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/567911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion","html_url":"https://github.com/dlmarion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-24T21:32:09Z","updated_at":"2024-10-24T21:32:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> ... it still may be useful to expose the aggregated status via a public API, rather than a Thrift endpoint, for direct consumption by the monitor, as well as outside tools.

The branch is a mess because I got sidetracked by https://github.com/micrometer-metrics/micrometer/issues/5607 during this experiment which caused the following problem. \r\n\r\n 1. Tsever creates a registry that ingnores tableId tags using the SPI plugin and then wraps this registry with a CompositeMeterRegistry\r\n 2. Tsever hosts a tablet for tableId=1 and create meters for tableId=1\r\n 3. Tsever hosts a tablet for tableId=2 and create meters for tableId=2\r\n 4. The tablet for tableId=1 is unloaded from the tserver and there are no other tablets for tableId=1 so remove the meters for tableId=1.  Because of micrometer issue 5607 after this removal no metrics are ever seen again for tableId=2.\r\n\r\nTrying to figure out how this could be worked around and/or fixed upstream.  Want to wait and see if the bug is considered valid before attempting an upstream fix.  If we can not figure out a workaround, this bug may prevent adding tableId tags to metrics because we must have the ability to filter out tableId tags.  Would only run into this bug if filtering and/or collapsing the tableId tag using a MeterFilter.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/2439695783/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/2442729423","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/4985#issuecomment-2442729423","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/4985","id":2442729423,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM6RmRfP","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-28T21:58:49Z","updated_at":"2024-10-28T21:59:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> I am still seeing errors when accessing an individual tserver page (e.g. /tservers?s=<tserver address>).

Looked in the monitor log and saw the following.  Tracing this back I suspect the cause may be this [line](https://github.com/apache/accumulo/blob/0f5984d769afe3c08f0b2704f50ab9aed5045c43/server/tserver/src/main/java/org/apache/accumulo/tserver/TabletStatsKeeper.java#L77) where `null` is passed in for the split into (looked at 3.1 and it always passes some object).  Could try passing in a `new ActionStats()` obj there for the split info and see if that fixes the monitor, if it does can open a follow on issue about fixing the tserver code.  Not sure why its passing null in there all the time, probably a bug introduced by removing bulk import and/or compaction code from the tserver.\r\n\r\n```\r\n2024-10-28T21:41:36,576

The problem is that Gauge meters are not properly aggregated.  If there are two Gauge meters and tags are removed collapsing them into a single meter, then the collapsed meter will only pull data from one of the gauges.  Given there two problems with using meter filters to remove tableId tags in the only way I can see forward is to have a an accumulo property that enables/disable per table tags on metrics.

It really introduces a lot of complexity, from using more of the slf4j API rather than treating it as a simple logging facade, to adding extra configuration and possibly code to convert between them, and modifying the logging templates to include the map context. It also forces developers to think about thread-local views of the context, every time you want to include thread-local context in a log message, and is likely going to lead to a lot of programmer errors with regard to logging (like not realizing that a log message originating from a class executed in an executor won't inherit the context, when refactoring code that logs).\r\n\r\nIt'd be much easier to just avoid MDC and ThreadLocalContext for logging, and limit our use of slf4j to a very simple logging facade for the basic log level methods `logger.info()`, `logger.error()`, etc. If we want to log additional contextual details, it's much easier to maintain if we just pass around the contextual data we want to log, and include it directly in the message string. MDC/ThreadLocalContext is really best used for general-purpose context information you want to include in every log message, but aren't directly related to what is being logged (like the client IP address and username associated with a request, in a server-side error message that handles the request - not directly related to the error, but perhaps useful to know who is triggering it or who is impacted by it).

Problems found are now logged at warn instead of stdout. Detailed, non-error info logged at trace.\r\n- Created new check `Check.TABLE_LOCKS` which ensures that table and namespace locks are valid and are associated with a FATE op. This depends on SYSTEM_CONFIG, which seemed like the most fitting location for it in the dependency tree.\r\n- New check `assertNoOtherChecksRan()` in `AdminCheckIT` which ensures only the expected checks ran\r\n- A few misc review changes: `MetadataCheckRunner` code improved to only fetch required columns when scanning, object creation moved outside of a loop\r\n\r\nLet me know how these changes look.

So the extra CPU overhead is causing it to take 2.6 times longer.\r\n\r\n```\r\n0 : 56883ms\r\n1 : 11ms\r\n2 : 11ms\r\n3 : 11ms\r\n4 : 11ms\r\n5 : 9ms\r\n6 : 9ms\r\n7 : 8ms\r\n8 : 6ms\r\n9 : 5ms\r\n10 : 6ms\r\n11 : 5ms\r\n12 : 9ms\r\n13 : 6ms\r\n14 : 5ms\r\n15 : 5ms\r\n16 : 5ms\r\n17 : 5ms\r\n18 : 5ms\r\n19 : 6ms\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/2465200143/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/2465450561","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/5037#issuecomment-2465450561","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/5037","id":2465450561,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM6S88pB","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-08T18:01:52Z","updated_at":"2024-11-08T18:01:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Would a 2.1 cluster.yaml file fail to parse w/ a clean message w/ these changes?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/2465450561/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
