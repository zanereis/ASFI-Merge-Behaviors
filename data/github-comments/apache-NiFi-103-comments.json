In the future you could rebase, squash, and force push the PR if you want to get back to a clean state but the history could all stay on the same PR.  It helps both you and reviewer.  I'd love to help you get this thing in but it is a bit elusive to get the timing right between contrib, review cycles, pr resets, etc..
