thanks for the contribution.\r\n\r\nI guess this problem can be quite painful.\r\nFor performance reasons I would go another way to fix this problem. I would add a check to the close() function. It would check after successful close if the file length is 0. That is simple to implement and would happen only after a close. If the close was not called from a catch block, we could omit this for further speed.\r\nI guess, still there could be a problem when the quota is exceeded, Flume can get into a sort of infinite loop as it tries to write the same event to HDFS again and again. Some sort off backoff should be implemented to reduce load. Needs to be checked if it is true.\r\n\r\nLet me know please, what you think.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/issues/comments/429890892/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/issues/comments/430971181","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/logging-flume/pull/230#issuecomment-430971181","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/issues/230","id":430971181,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMDk3MTE4MQ==","user":{"login":"majorendre","id":34535487,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTM1NDg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34535487?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/majorendre","html_url":"https://github.com/majorendre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majorendre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majorendre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majorendre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majorendre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majorendre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majorendre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majorendre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majorendre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majorendre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-18T11:20:07Z","updated_at":"2018-10-18T11:20:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@szaboferee  Thanks for the changes, all looks good.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/issues/comments/430971181/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/issues/comments/431057008","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/logging-flume/pull/225#issuecomment-431057008","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/issues/225","id":431057008,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMTA1NzAwOA==","user":{"login":"ffernandez92","id":20140348,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTQwMzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20140348?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffernandez92","html_url":"https://github.com/ffernandez92","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffernandez92/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffernandez92/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffernandez92/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffernandez92/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffernandez92/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffernandez92/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffernandez92/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffernandez92/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffernandez92/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-18T15:36:51Z","updated_at":"2018-10-18T15:36:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi!\r\n\r\nSorry for the late answer I’ve been a little bit under a rush lately.
