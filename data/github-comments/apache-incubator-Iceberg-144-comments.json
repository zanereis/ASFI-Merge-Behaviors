We also have some properties that we want to set as admins like `write.object-storage.enabled` that we don't want users to set or worry about. As @jackye1995 mentioned we could have three levels\r\n- default - users can override\r\n- required - users cannot override\r\n- Another category for anything that can be added to defaults. (In spark we do that for properties like `spark.executor.extraJavaOptions` etc. Not sure if Iceberg has such properties). \r\n\r\nI can take a look at how this can be done.

`purchase_ts` being a timestamp, has all sorts of values that are not a round day, so to have a predicate transformed into `day(purchase_ts) = day(timestampOf(2021-01-01)`, how would you write it?\r\n> \r\n> * `on target.purchase_ts = timestampOf(2021-01-01)` doesn't seem right, because if `purchase_ts = 2021-01-01 14:10:00.001`, the meaning is actually different\r\n> * `on target.purchase_ts = timestamp '2021-01-01 14:10:00.001'`, if you know the exact value of the partition key in the target row\r\n> * `on target.purchase_ts >= timestamp '2021-01-01' and target.purchase_ts < timestamp '2021-01-02'`\r\n> * I don't think `on day(target.purchase_ts) = '2021-01-01'` or similar works, as far as I've tried?\r\n> \r\n> Thanks!\r\n\r\nI think I may have misled you by oversimplifying. The user here still only writes queries using their exact restrictions, Iceberg then uses this restriction to create restrictions which match the partitioning. For example, Iceberg knows a specific timestamp can only occur in a certain day and it can use that information to limit the files read. Iceberg doesn't disregard the original predicate, that stays with the execution engine for actually evaluating rows but Iceberg can still use this timestamp for partition pruning and file evaluation.\r\n\r\nFor example say you are looking for \r\n`ts = 3PM on Aug 12`\r\n\r\nFirst thing we do is look at our manifest_list file, see docs in the [spec](https://iceberg.apache.org/#spec/)\r\nEach entry there will have a `partitions` field summary column and a `partition_spec_id` to let us know how to use that data. \r\n\r\nWe load up the partition spec for the given spec ID and transform the original predicate into one that matches that spec. If our `spec` contains a `day(ts)` transform we take the original predicate and transform it using the `day` transform . So for evaluating this line the original predicate becomes `day(ts) = projectDay(3pm Aug 12) = Aug 12`. \r\n\r\nWith this new transform we evaluate all the `partitions` listed in this file. These values only contain `day(ts)` since that is the only thing kept by the spec. If any pass we know the particular manifest file may have valid datafiles to be scanned.\r\n\r\nOnce we have a list of all the possible manifest files that may have hits we play this game again. Now we check against `ManifestEntries`. Every entry contains a `partition` value and then details about the `datafile` (spec_id is inherited from the entry in manifest_list). \r\n\r\nHere we can do two steps of evaluation for each individual data file. First we can use the transformed predicate (`day(ts) = Aug 12`) to check if the partition value is a match, if so we then move to evaluating the individual metrics of the file. Here we would use the original predicate and would check whether the `3PM on Aug 12` is a possible value for the timestamp column of each file based on the min and max values for that column. If datafile passes both of these checks we keep it for the scan.\r\n\r\nThe scan then contains of all data files which we know **may** have our given row, this is transformed into a set of tasks for whatever execution engine is in use and evaluated. The execution engine then will use its own logic to filter individual rows with the original predicates (YMMV based on engine specific implementations).\r\n\r\nSo what happens if we cannot transform a predicate into the partition spec? Or what if a data file was inserted into the table when it was unpartitioned? In both of these cases we default to \"this file may contain the row we are looking for\" and return it to the engine. For example, suppose you have a predicate `age > 10` and a partition spec of `bucket(age,128)`. There is no way to project a [greater than predicate](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/f960698a04266270a8eaf9e23e8b55e97e550564/api/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/transforms/Bucket.java#L131-L134) into a valid bucket predicate so we simply have to say all partitions may match. \r\n\r\n### \r\nMy big TLDR here is:\r\n\r\nAs a user you query on normal columns, Iceberg attempts to transform your predicates into ones that match the partitioning of the files within the table to prune out files. When Iceberg cannot transform the predicates it simply assumes there may be a match and returns those files to the execution engine which does the actual row level filtering.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1024416788/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":8,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1024572860","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3517#issuecomment-1024572860","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3517","id":1024572860,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX849Eb28","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-28T19:41:14Z","updated_at":"2022-01-28T19:41:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Merged.

But it would be nice if they could still commit the `version.txt` file or handle enough of it to be able to pass it off easily.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1024718266/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1024774708","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3955#issuecomment-1024774708","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3955","id":1024774708,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX849FNI0","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-29T00:51:57Z","updated_at":"2022-01-29T00:51:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the reviews, @RussellSpitzer, @danielcweeks, @jackye1995, @kbendick, @szehon-ho, and @bryanck!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1024774708/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1024788880","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3981#issuecomment-1024788880","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3981","id":1024788880,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX849FQmQ","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-29T01:08:13Z","updated_at":"2022-01-29T01:08:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@emkornfield, I just had a discussion with @CircArgs about this yesterday. I think that we're currently evaluating whether integration with Python's type system is necessary and worth the additional complexity. It seems like the main benefit is to be able to have functions like transforms that accept a certain argument type and to make the literals conform to that type. But given how we will process actual data (and not just literal values in in expressions) won't use type safety because the data is in a dataframe or some direct representation (like a python int rather than a wrapper around int), it seems fairly limited.\r\n\r\nI think we may want to go with a simpler type implementation, but @CircArgs was going to give it some thought and weigh in.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1024788880/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1024802697","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3981#issuecomment-1024802697","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3981","id":1024802697,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX849FT-J","user":{"login":"emkornfield","id":17869838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODY5ODM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17869838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/emkornfield","html_url":"https://github.com/emkornfield","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emkornfield/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emkornfield/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emkornfield/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emkornfield/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emkornfield/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emkornfield/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emkornfield/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emkornfield/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emkornfield/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-29T01:45:01Z","updated_at":"2022-01-29T01:45:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rdblue thanks for the update.

Everything I've found so far is installed via `npm` or  `pip` and I haven't been able to determine if there's consensus around the best tool (or even top 3 best CLI tools). I'm not one to dive right in on bringing in an `npm` based dependency without some research.\r\n\r\nIt's presently valid per `editor.swagger.io` - which is a paid / enterprise tool (with a free tier) which focuses in this space (open api docs). So I'm continuing to use editor.swagger.io as the canonical validation tool, but fixing things that could be made better for parsing in other tools.\r\n\r\nSo this is a step in that direction, as well as looking more consistent. 🙂

The implementation here seems matching what is implemented in Java, i.e. \r\n```\r\n    Assert.assertTrue(Types.FixedType.ofLength(10) != Types.FixedType.ofLength(10));\r\n    Assert.assertTrue(Types.FixedType.ofLength(10).equals(Types.FixedType.ofLength(10)));\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think the issue here is related to the consistency. For non-parameterized types, `is` and `==` return the same results but for non non parameterized types, they are not.\r\n\r\nIf we want to make `is` to be the same as `==`, one way is that we can cache created non parameterized types, which seems to be the approach in https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4016.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1026551586/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1026598525","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3980#issuecomment-1026598525","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3980","id":1026598525,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX849MKZ9","user":{"login":"szlta","id":40628386,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNjI4Mzg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40628386?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szlta","html_url":"https://github.com/szlta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szlta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szlta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szlta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szlta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szlta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szlta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szlta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szlta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szlta/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-01T08:42:58Z","updated_at":"2022-02-01T08:42:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks

A few follow ups.\r\n\r\n1. What you said is definitely correct that we translate `gc.enabled` behavior to hive's `external.table.purge` behavior while creating hms table in hive catalog. However, the issue I am pointing to is that `external` table behavior is not translated to `gc.enabled` behavior. The issue should be evident from unit tests added in this PR, but let me also add a bit of clarification to the PR summary.\r\n2. `external.table.purge` is only supported for >= Hive 4.x.\r\n3. I think I should update the diff to also check for `external.table.purge` property before turning on/off gc.enabled.
