Regardless of maven placing artifacts in the cache, what still doesn't make sense to me is why Maven doesn't seem to be ordering the reactor properly with a multi-module project with the parallel build setting enabled. I tried validation on multiple configurations with and without parallel settings. The non-parallel build sets up the order as expected whereas the parallel build doesn't seem to honor the dependency hierarchy fully. It would be great to know why this is so we can run the build with whatever profile or install/package command we choose, with a single command, in parallel.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/295976799/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/295978472","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/538#issuecomment-295978472","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/538","id":295978472,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NTk3ODQ3Mg==","user":{"login":"mmiklavc","id":658443,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODQ0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/658443?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc","html_url":"https://github.com/mmiklavc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-21T00:05:18Z","updated_at":"2017-04-21T00:05:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Further, the reason that install worked is not because it needs the artifacts in the cache, per se. It's because of something in the way our multi-module build is structured that isn't allowing artifacts in the metron-deployment project hierarchy to see projects in metron-platform. The reason \"package\" would normally work on a typical build (without ever having done an install) is because sibling modules are able to reference the pom info of each other, and therefore the appropriate target directories containing the standard build artifacts, e.g. jars.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/295978472/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/295980903","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/538#issuecomment-295980903","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/538","id":295980903,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NTk4MDkwMw==","user":{"login":"mmiklavc","id":658443,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODQ0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/658443?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc","html_url":"https://github.com/mmiklavc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-21T00:13:18Z","updated_at":"2017-04-21T00:13:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"As I stated in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-856, this is a fix that will work given the current configuration, but will quite possibly break with future changes.

We could approximate that by moving metron-deployment to the last module in the list in the top-level pom and add jar dependencies to the metron-rpm project. That would at least give Maven a fighting chance to do what we want. It worked in my environment, but the only real way (in a multi-threaded build) to guarantee that the rpm packaging occurs after assembly runs for all the required modules is to make 2 calls. Otherwise we're relying on unsupported functionality that may not work the same way in different versions.

In particular it can only accept syntax which leads to a fixed length expression, so these are **excluded**:\r\n\r\n```\r\n*  zero to many\r\n+ one to many\r\n() groups\r\n{n,m} n to m copies.\r\n X | Y alternatives.\r\n```\r\n\r\nShorthands defined in this document also do not currently function properly (e.g. [ascii].\r\n\r\nFinally note that inversion  ^ functions differently to most regular expression syntaxes.  The token being inverted is the following token, not the entire set.  So most regex would say something like [^ 01 02 03] meaning every byte except 01, 02 and 03.  In byteseek this would be ^[ 01 02 03], as you are inverting the set.  [ ^01 02 03] is also valid - except you are now specifying a set containing everything but 01 (which already covers 02 and 03).\r\n\r\n It's fairly easy to create a different parser if necessary, but most of byteseek regex syntax is fairly standard - but oriented towards bytes rather than strings as the default atomic unit.\r\n\r\nAny questions please feel free to ask (and I really must update the syntax document!).\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nMatt.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/296190615/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/296192866","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/541#issuecomment-296192866","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/541","id":296192866,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NjE5Mjg2Ng==","user":{"login":"nishihatapalmer","id":4427300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MjczMDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4427300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishihatapalmer","html_url":"https://github.com/nishihatapalmer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishihatapalmer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishihatapalmer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishihatapalmer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishihatapalmer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishihatapalmer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishihatapalmer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishihatapalmer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishihatapalmer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishihatapalmer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-21T13:38:18Z","updated_at":"2017-04-21T13:38:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"When you say use regexes, do you mean use the regex syntax to create fixed length sequences, or do you mean use full regex functionality?
