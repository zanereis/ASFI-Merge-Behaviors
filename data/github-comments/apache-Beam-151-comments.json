What happens when the pipeline is behind by 5 minutes. We will end up marking 4 minutes of that as late data. \r\n\r\nI think we can do a pretty good job with `LogAppendTime`. E.g. we can keep track of latest timestamp from each of the partitions and return the least among them. Only tricky part is handling idle partitions where we might not see any records for some time. We know if we have completely consumed a partition. We can advance the watermark to something like 'current time - 5 seconds' in that case.\r\n\r\n(2): Not sure that. Why not less than all of them. In case of 'createTime' we can require user to set the watermarkFn for now.\r\n\r\nImplementation wise, we can have multiple watermark policies 'LogAppendTimePolicy', 'ProcessingTimePolicy', 'CreateTimePolicy' (that last one just requires user to set watermakFn).\r\n\r\nFor this PR, we can default to old behavior of 'processing time' for 'curTimestamp' and follow up with proper support for LogAppendTime. Rest of the PR could remain the same, i.e. 'timestmap' in KafkaRecord would be the timestamp provided by Kafka.\r\n\r\nIn your Kafka 0.10.x deployment, did you enable per record timestamps?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/288617022/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/288617623","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/2267#issuecomment-288617623","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/2267","id":288617623,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4ODYxNzYyMw==","user":{"login":"rangadi","id":502522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/502522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi","html_url":"https://github.com/rangadi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-23T04:57:02Z","updated_at":"2017-03-23T04:57:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"cc: @amitsela","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/288617623/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/288618026","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/2284#issuecomment-288618026","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/2284","id":288618026,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4ODYxODAyNg==","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-23T05:01:00Z","updated_at":"2017-03-23T05:01:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Can you tag with multiple JIRAs?
