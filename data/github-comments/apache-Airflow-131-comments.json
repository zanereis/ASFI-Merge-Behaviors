In `base_task_runner.py`, I see that the command to spin up the process always have raw set to True:\r\n```\r\n        self._command = popen_prepend + self._task_instance.command_as_list(\r\n            raw=True,\r\n            pickle_id=local_task_job.pickle_id,\r\n            mark_success=local_task_job.mark_success,\r\n            job_id=local_task_job.id,\r\n            pool=local_task_job.pool,\r\n            cfg_path=cfg_path,\r\n        )\r\n```\r\nI agree with you that it doesn't make sense to have the root process killing itself, and your PR addresses this with:\r\n```\r\nif pid == os.getpid():\r\n    raise RuntimeError(\"I refuse to kill myself\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn addition, I think we should delete the signal handler in the [`--raw` task process](https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/blob/master/airflow/models.py#L1541-L1546).

This PR simply extends this behavior when user impersonation is specified. \r\n\r\nThat said, I share the same concern as @Fokko, I still believe we have a potential security concern on the whole by passing down all environment variables to the local task execution. This means that it is the responsibility of (1) the airflow admin to not store sensitive data in environment variables in production or (2) the dag repo maintainer to properly audit the dag file and make sure it is not malicious. (1) seems very hard to guarantee (2) seems easier, but not foolproof.\r\n\r\nI'm okay with merging this PR since it's just extending existing behavior.

The signal handler is there to trigger the on_kill method of the operator. If absent that would not be run anymore. bashOperator and the SparkSubmitOperator both make use of this.\r\n\r\nOn your comment of the “root” process. I don’t think you are correct and your implementation worked by coincidence. If you run “bash -c sleep 1000”, you will find ‘sleep’ in your process list but you won’t find ‘bash’ running anymore. However the parent pid of sleep still refers to the pid of bash. So your implementation worked in case of a TaskRunner that used something like bash to execute the command. If you would you “sleep” directly (so without bash) you would get ourselves as the parent of the “sleep” process and thus kill yourself.\r\n\r\nUsing setsid makes sure we Airflow sees all processes to the new session/group regardless. Except when they run setsid themselves, which happens for example in the BashOperator. The bashOperator therefore becomes responsible for cleaning up after itself.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/380332446/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/380346160","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2199#issuecomment-380346160","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2199","id":380346160,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MDM0NjE2MA==","user":{"login":"sekikn","id":898388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/898388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn","html_url":"https://github.com/sekikn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-11T06:50:39Z","updated_at":"2018-04-11T06:50:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for sharing your code and investigation @Mokubyow!\r\nI'm afraid I'm not sure yet if your workaround solves this problem fundamentally, since there seems to be no operation which detaches DagModel object from the session (e.g. expunge) or expires its attributes (e.g. expire or commit) up to [the line in question](https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/blob/master/airflow/api/common/experimental/delete_dag.py#L48).

It could take any of the PIDs and get the GPID from there. By coincidence/convention when you call `setsid` the OS (POSIX) sets the GPID to the PID of the process that is the leader of the group. In `reap_process_group` we only add the parent pid to ensure we can watch all processes in the process group otherwise we could quit right away thinking we are done.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/380595046/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/380621816","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3214#issuecomment-380621816","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3214","id":380621816,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MDYyMTgxNg==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-11T22:59:03Z","updated_at":"2018-04-12T20:23:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#
