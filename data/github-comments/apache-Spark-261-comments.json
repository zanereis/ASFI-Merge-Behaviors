In Shark, `SharkServer` does rely on `SharkDriver`, but `SharkServer2` doesn't. In the case of Spark SQL, firstly we don't have a service equivalent to `SharkServer`, and `HiveThriftServer2`, which is equivalent to `SharkServer2` doesn't depend on `SparkSQLDriver`. And `SparkSQLCLIService` doesn't crash in front of bad queries, as @scwf has suggested.\n\nJust added a comment related to error reporting. Otherwise LGTM. This one is indeed cleaner than #1661. Thanks for working on this @chenghao-intel
