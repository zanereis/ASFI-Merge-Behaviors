I decide to create two new modules, one is called `pulsar-common` that is used for extracting the same logic between v2.7 and v2.8, and another is called `pulsar-2.8.x-plugin` that is used for supporting pulsar client of version 2.8.x. Old `pulsar-plugin` module is only for v2.7. What do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/979913495/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/980486760","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/8175#issuecomment-980486760","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/8175","id":980486760,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArmls846cQpo","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-27T02:08:30Z","updated_at":"2021-11-27T02:08:30Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Generally, unless they are really common, we don't recommend adding this kind of package.\nThis is not about technology, just because users may ignore this package should br included, or confuse about when should exclude, which could cause false bug report.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/980486760/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/980633647","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/8175#issuecomment-980633647","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/8175","id":980633647,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArmls846c0gv","user":{"login":"wallezhang","id":33749,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33749?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wallezhang","html_url":"https://github.com/wallezhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wallezhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wallezhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wallezhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wallezhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wallezhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wallezhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wallezhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wallezhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wallezhang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-27T14:06:09Z","updated_at":"2021-11-27T14:06:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Generally, unless they are really common, we don't recommend adding this kind of package.\r\n> This is not about technology, just because users may ignore this package should br included, or confuse about when should exclude, which could cause false bug report.\r\n\r\nThe only difference between v2.7 and v2.8 is the logic of adding properties on the producer side.
