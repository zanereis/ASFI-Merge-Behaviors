\r\n\r\nI think the root cause is a bit different. Seems like your workflow/job pattern is different than many other ASF projects, you are simply launching MANY workflows and jobs.\r\n\r\nHave  you considered merging those workflows into smaller number of them ? I think actually the many, many workflows launched by pulsar are the reason for many ASF projects to get blocked queue.\r\n\r\nSee this chart:\r\n\r\n![06a6b973-fee9-4651-a197-a275a39b6f55](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/595491/105729417-7cfc2b00-5f2d-11eb-9da6-69c7b9d5904f.png)\r\n\r\nI am happy to help Pulsar to redesign their CI to be a bit more friendlier towards other projects? I have quite an experience with that - in Apache Airflow I introduced changes that brought the usage of Github Actions by 70% maintaining it's usefulness and I am pretty sure the way you are using GitHub Actions can be optimised. Super Happy to help with that if needed.\r\n\r\nYou can also see the discussions we had about it at the ASF discussion lists recently. I thik this thread from the last weekend describes the current state of affairs rather well: https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r6130d6d111217b8a90b3b90bbb3029b75b5e2a4b5463f8d2c8f130f6%40%3Cusers.infra.apache.org%3E  (you need to sign-up to users@infra.apache.org to view it).\r\n\r\n\r\nDo
