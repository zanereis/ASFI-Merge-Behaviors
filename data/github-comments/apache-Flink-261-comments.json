@zentol.  splitting based on : was added to support multiple file paths.\r\nIn windows File.pathSepertor= \";\" where as in unix its File.pathSepertor= \":\". \r\nThe reference you pointed https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2482 is correct but in that code base the implementation of setDbStoragePaths() is different from current code base. That is the change in API from org.apache.flink.core.fs.Path to java.io.File and the introduction of an extra File.isAbsolute() check.\r\nDue to the above changes in setDbStoragePaths() its not possible to provide the configuration like this-\r\nstate.backend.rocksdb.localdir = file:///some/file/path. If I'm not wrong this is valid way of providing config.
