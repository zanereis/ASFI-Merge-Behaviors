The most direct fix is to introduce a test dependency on org.apache.zookeeper:zookeeper, I believe, which is already configured in the parent?\n\nHow does it work with SBT? Well, zookeeper is a transitive dependency of Kafka, and Kafka is a non-test dependency of this module. SBT includes it, perhaps. I know Maven, weirdly, does _not_ include transitive dependencies of test dependencies for some reason.\n\nIn fact spark-core uses zookeeper too and doesn't express the dependency. It's also getting away with it because Curator depends on Zookeeper. That's kind of OK since Curator is a ZK utility of sorts. But not technically right, and means that the ZK version in the build is not actually controlled by its zookeeper.properties value. (It's unused.)\n\nI'll make a PR tomorrow if nobody has patched it already. It'd be good to get both of those corrected, but the immediate issue is the test compilation issue.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51276904/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51277474","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1792#issuecomment-51277474","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1792","id":51277474,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMjc3NDc0","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-06T00:08:28Z","updated_at":"2014-08-06T00:08:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Jenkins,

The real problem is how SBT and Maven resolves multiple versions of the same library, which in this case, is Zookeeper. Observing and comparing the dependency trees from Maven and SBT showed this.

But Maven decides to stick to the closest (in the tree) dependent version of 3.3.4. And 3.3.4 does not have [NIOServerCnxnFactory](http://grepcode.com/search?query=NIOServerCnxnFactory&n=).\n\nThe solution is probably to exclude zookeeper from the apache-kafka dependency in streaming-kafka module so that it just inherits zookeeper from Spark core.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51282121/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51282138","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1481#issuecomment-51282138","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1481","id":51282138,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMjgyMTM4","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-06T01:04:19Z","updated_at":"2014-08-06T01:04:19Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA tests have started for PR 1481.

The error would be different with no zookeeper dep at all. Actually spark core forgot to depend on zookeeper. If you fix that in core and here it should work. No exclude needed.

am not sure adding a direct dependency on zookeeper in the core is a good idea.

In fact in generate, the reason kafka, flume, and other stuff were moved to external was so that they have no bearing on the dependencies in core.
