Let’s keep the discussion purely technical as we always enjoy in the community :-) \r\n\r\nWe have already done great work moving to TE compiler. It seems that there are some final sticky points we wanted to address.\r\n\r\nYep Cody is right and I was wrong. I just checked and saw several python functions registered in compile_engine.py still in use by TE compiler. We might want to move them to te_compiler.py.\r\n\r\nLily, Cody is referring to some methods implemented in python instead of c++. Although it doesn’t actually cause divergent code path right now, we are not in favor of mixing c++ and python if there is no specific reason. So as you said, we might want to migrate them to c++ some day in the future.\r\n\r\nThe input tensors are not exposed by methods in te compiler, which I assume is a fixable thing? Would you guys like to discuss more specifically on this? Do we want to slightly tweak the interface or add a new API to make it happen? Would love to hear concrete proposals from you guys!

Do you guys know when the next rebuild is scheduled? Thanks a lot!\r\n\r\nAdding a bit more context to what @areusch mentioned in the previous comment: we are building Docker images on a daily basis. All notifications go to the Discord channel `#ci-image-build` - have a look in there for more instructions on how to access the images.\r\n\r\nAs for the last image update, I raised an issue to request that. I think it is good practice because then  can keep track of why/when it was updated and who updated it. See https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/8782.\r\n\r\nI appreciate it doesn't cover your specific change in #8742, but now with the effort needed to access updated images drastically reduced, I think we can accelerate the pace in which change are reflected in the upstream CI.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/901790633/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/901834168","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8633#issuecomment-901834168","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8633","id":901834168,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM41wOW4","user":{"login":"Lyken17","id":7783214,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3ODMyMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7783214?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyken17","html_url":"https://github.com/Lyken17","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyken17/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyken17/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyken17/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyken17/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyken17/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyken17/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyken17/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyken17/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyken17/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-19T11:24:32Z","updated_at":"2021-08-19T11:27:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi there,\r\n\r\nIt seems this commit introduces bugs when tunning models on raspberry pis.

Let me clarify all my assumptions and models and see if we can clarify from there:\r\n\r\n1. I think exposing `compile_engine.py` was a mistake that was made at some point in the past, we intentionally made `compile_engine.h` a private header to not make it part of the public interface. For whatever reason it has been implicitly public due to being in Python so we now need to deal with that.\r\n2. I think we should only have 1 endorsed way to control scheduling, and a unified single lowering mechanism. A lot of the pain for accelerator flows and BYOC, etc are due to the fact there are many ways people use the \"compile engine style API\".\r\n3. My intention is to eventually make it impossible to lower functions one by one (i.e JIT/Lower/LowerInternal) as it doesn't really match any of the current compilation flows well and causes issues. \r\n4. We can split out the internals of TECompiler to provide a functional API for producing tensors from a Relay function which is then used by the compiler and potentially you in your use case. \r\n5. Ideally end state is that the TECompiler itself would be part of the private interface and not exposed in Python.\r\n\r\nI am happy to support use cases along the way to this world if I better understand critical need. I do agree that we need to move the few registered helped functions, but other then that `compile_engine` is dead code. All the other uses in the code base are just calls to turn off the cache.

Meanwhile, I have two cases:\r\n\r\n1. We do lower Relay function one-by-one with JIT. It seems to me that this might be a reasonable exception, because we could naturally have a JIT compiler that compiles each function when visiting them at the first time. Meanwhile, the current Relay interpreter wraps each function to a single module and performs lowering, which seems not necessary but a workaround. cc @icemelon @yzhliu \r\n\r\n2. The case of using Python could be a relatively miner. Specifically, if we lower a Relay function using TE compiler directly in C++, then we have no way to configure AutoTVM and AutoScheduler (e.g., tracing and logging mode), since both tuning frameworks have some logic purely in Python.\r\n\r\nFinally, while I agree that TE compiler could be as private as possible, it doesn't hurt to keep the Python interface for debugging and experiments. We just need to make sure they are only used for developments and no one really uses them in the submitted PRs.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/902349542/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/902361519","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8770#issuecomment-902361519","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8770","id":902361519,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM41yPGv","user":{"login":"huanmei9","id":13827738,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODI3NzM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13827738?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huanmei9","html_url":"https://github.com/huanmei9","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huanmei9/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huanmei9/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huanmei9/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huanmei9/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huanmei9/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huanmei9/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huanmei9/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huanmei9/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huanmei9/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-20T01:26:20Z","updated_at":"2021-08-20T01:26:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi,

Creates a temporary directory\r\n2. Writes some files\r\n3. Checks those files\r\n\r\nWith the current behaviour, if two tasks attempt to do this in parallel (such as parallel tests from pytest-xdist), you get the following:\r\n1. Task A creates a temporary directory\r\n2. Task A writes some files\r\n3. Task B attempts to create a temporary directory - raises Exception that temporary directory already exists\r\n4. Task A checks those files\r\nTask B has failed as it tries to pollute the existing temporary directory.\r\n\r\nWith this change, you can instead have:\r\n1. Task A creates a temporary directory\r\n2. Task A writes some files\r\n3. Task B attempts to create a temporary directory - no error raised\r\n4. Task B writes some files\r\n5. Task A checks those files - raises assertion error\r\n6. Task B checks those files\r\nTask A has now failed because of the pollution of the temporary directory and the error is also incorrectly attributed to Task A rather than Task B. This scenario only occurs intermittently and is therefore harder to debug.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I would suggest that the current implementation of temp dir helps to prevent such concurrency bugs and raises the correct error to ensure we use a new fresh temp directory per invocation -

Specifically, in the constructor of `RelayVisualizer` in #8448 :\r\n```python\r\nclass RelayVisualizer:\r\n    \"\"\"Relay IR Visualizer\"\"\"\r\n\r\n    def __init__(\r\n        self, relay_mod, relay_param=None, plotter_be=PlotterBackend.BOKEH, render_cb=_dft_render_cb\r\n    ):\r\n```\r\n\r\nI try to port this PR with the interface in the following commit in the file `_terminal.py`.\r\nhttps://github.com/chiwwang/tvm/commit/4d1e14a1fa0fdef09ac3c8a7f0556588a276e5f1\r\n(I also make the callback coupled with the backend....but this seems not a good idea. A common render-callback can save efforts of implementing a new backend.)\r\n\r\nThe output looks like:\r\n```\r\n`@main([Var(x)])\r\n  `--Call multiply\r\n    |--Var(Input)\r\n    `--Call add\r\n      |--Var(Input)\r\n      `--Constshape: (), dtype: int32`\r\n```\r\nI don't know if I should consider multiply/add as an argument of `Call`, so I put it in `Call` string.\r\nThis might be fixed by modifying tmv.ir.Op branch in the callback.\r\n\r\nSo, currently interfaces of relay-viz in my mind is:\r\n1. class Plotter and class Graph in plotter.py (one plotter can have lots of graphs)\r\n2. If needed, a backend-specific render-callback can overwrite the default one, with the prototype\r\n```python\r\ndef render_cb(graph, node_to_id, relay_param)\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    Parameters\r\n    ----------\r\n    graph : class plotter.Graph\r\n    node_to_id : Dict[relay.expr, int]\r\n    relay_param : Dict[string, NDarray]\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n```\r\nAdditionally, the dict `node_to_id` ensure its order of keys is in the post-order of a relay `GlobalVar`.\r\nHow do you think this kind of integration?\r\nThanks :)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/903155532/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/903158848","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8448#issuecomment-903158848","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8448","id":903158848,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM411RxA","user":{"login":"chiwwang","id":84191062,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MTkxMDYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84191062?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwwang","html_url":"https://github.com/chiwwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-21T18:39:56Z","updated_at":"2021-08-21T18:39:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"A quick status update.

for the discussion. I would love to specifically put up a proposal on re-organizing the spaghetti code for better readability, and prove it actually practical in our particular case.\r\n\r\nThe code can be reorganized into 4 methods:\r\n- Method 1. Collect the loops provided by users into an unordered set, and its signature is:\r\n\r\n```C++\r\n(\r\n  self: ScheduleState,\r\n  ordered_loop_srefs: Array<StmtSRef>\r\n) -> std::unordered_set<const StmtSRefNode*>;\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Method 2: Find `top` and `bottom` of the chain, and its signature is:\r\n\r\n```C++\r\n(\r\n    self: ScheduleState,\r\n    loop_srefs: std::unordered_set<const StmtSRefNode*>\r\n) -> (const StmtSRefNode*, const StmtSRefNode*)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that we don't need `ordered_loop_srefs` in this method because the order of the loops doesn't actually affect the algorithm.\r\n\r\n- Method 3: Construct the loop chain:\r\n\r\n```C++\r\n(\r\n  self: ScheduleState,\r\n  top: const StmtSRefNode*,\r\n  bottom: const StmtSRefNode*\r\n) -> std::vector<const StmtSRefNode*>\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Method 4: Construct the new loop chain:\r\n\r\n```C++\r\n(\r\n  self: ScheduleState,\r\n  chain: std::vector<const StmtSRefNode*>,\r\n  ordered_loop_srefs: Array<StmtSRef>,\r\n  loop_srefs: std::unordered_set<const StmtSRefNode*>,\r\n) -> For\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy this decomposition, we eliminate a handful of temporary variables and data structures, and made the hundred-line logic much clearer with small methods of within 30 lines. There is not much \"data sharing\" between methods either. Therefore, in terms of code quality, I do believe we have concrete motivation to make this simple change by just moving code around.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/903229077/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/903280843","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8767#issuecomment-903280843","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8767","id":903280843,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM411vjL","user":{"login":"jinhongyii","id":44201588,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MjAxNTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44201588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii","html_url":"https://github.com/jinhongyii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-22T14:53:29Z","updated_at":"2021-08-22T14:53:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@junrushao1994 I've separated the logic into several methods.

The current documentation references running the C++ tests using the `./tests/script/task_cpp_unittest.sh` which this change allows to continue transparently (https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/main/docs/install/from_source.rst).\r\n\r\nAs far as what this patch actually does, `make cpptest` will now build a single `cpptest` binary from `${TEST_SRCS}`, which `gtest_discover_tests` will scan to find the actual GTest tests and generate `add_test` and `set_tests_properties` behind the scenes in CMake, such as:\r\n```\r\nadd_test( Array.Iterator /workspaces/tvm-sandbox-micro/src/tvm/build/cpptest [==[--gtest_filter=Array.Iterator]==] --gtest_also_run_disabled_tests)\r\nset_tests_properties( Array.Iterator PROPERTIES WORKING_DIRECTORY /workspaces/tvm-sandbox-micro/src/tvm/build SKIP_REGULAR_EXPRESSION [==[\\[  SKIPPED \\]]==])\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis then allows your IDE or other tools to inspect this and generate commands to invoke individual tests from within the editor:\r\n![ctest-explorer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4933431/130491062-c357338b-2180-4e02-9686-b5f51d7f285e.png)\r\n\r\nCurrently whilst you can find the `_test` targets and build/run them there's no easy way of breaking that down any further; for example, if I just wanted to run the `AOTMemory.Allocate` test.\r\n\r\nLet me know if there's anything else you're interested in :smile_cat: \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/903972516/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/903979835","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7686#issuecomment-903979835","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7686","id":903979835,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM414aM7","user":{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-23T17:44:36Z","updated_at":"2021-08-23T17:44:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Congrats!
