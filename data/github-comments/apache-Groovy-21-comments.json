We are using soft references, because in the past a weak reference gave the class free too fast leading to the runtime constantly recreating the meta class and thus to horrible performance. Also just using a SoftReference is not supposed to prevent the class to be unloaded. There are JVM configurations that behave like this though.  \r\nOf course @NecOnIce is fully right when he says that the current configuration leads the JVM to use up all memory before anything is freed.\r\nBetter would be a system in which we count how often we create the meta class and then maybe go with the strategy of creating first a weak reference and after a threshold has been reached to change it to a soft reference... just as an idea","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/511848762/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/512105726","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/966#issuecomment-512105726","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/966","id":512105726,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMjEwNTcyNg==","user":{"login":"daniellansun","id":9151616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxNTE2MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9151616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun","html_url":"https://github.com/daniellansun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-17T05:18:35Z","updated_at":"2019-07-17T05:18:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Merged.

The behavior which constantly recreates the metaclass is really no suitable solution and i agree that my Request therefore is no solution as well. \r\nThe Problem where i have observed the behavior of using nearly the maximum amount of memory was an application which loads Strings out of a Database which represents Rules for calculating prices. These are loaded many times a hour. Each time a purchase was made, a request is fired against the database and a String is evaluated. For each such request Groovy creates a new script class and a corresponding metaclass. I was able to free the created Script classes but not the metaclasses. I think the Problem here lies in the fact, that groovy can't know if it should keep the metaclass for later recreations or not ... Could it be possible to manually free all metaclasses of a GroovyShell by calling a method on it? Like the  resetLoadedClasses() method? So as a programmer i'm able to free specific metaclasses this way?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/516019195/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/516226121","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/968#issuecomment-516226121","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/968","id":516226121,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNjIyNjEyMQ==","user":{"login":"blackdrag","id":470278,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MDI3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/470278?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag","html_url":"https://github.com/blackdrag","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-30T01:47:10Z","updated_at":"2019-07-30T01:47:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"But the metaclass has hard references on the class it is a metaclass for I thought.
