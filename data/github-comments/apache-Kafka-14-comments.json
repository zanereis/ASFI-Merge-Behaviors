for the discussion @hachikuji @becketqin, this is very helpful. A few thoughts:\n1. We can probably solve the problem that the same exception having different semantics for different request / response by introducing new exception codes, but we can also add the request API code into the the RequestFuture and let wrap the logic inside RequestFuture for determining isRetriable() instead of just the exception type itself.\n2. If there is a coordinator failover, the new coordinator will have the following phases:\n\na) it does not yet know that this group belongs to itself:\n\nHence returns the NOT_COORDINATOR_FOR_CONSUMER, which is retriable.\n\nb) being notified by the controller and gone though becomeLeader but the group is not created yet:\n\nHence just blindly commit the offset since it thinks this consumer does not use Kafka for membership.\n\nc) the group is finally created, but the consumer id is unknown or the generation id is out-dated:\n\nHence will return UNKNOWN_CONSUMER or ILLEGAL_GENERATION, which is now non-retriable.\n\nFor me I think the current case b) is really bad, as it will accept any commits and this phase will only end when someone sends a JoinGroup, phase c) will now possibly result in consumption duplicates. So I feel \npersisting the metadata to ZK is necessary because it relates to correctness but not only duplicates: in b) it will not blindly commit the offset but will return GroupMetadataLoadingInProgress, and in c) it will possibly discovered the consumer already.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/143289753/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/143297808","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/221#issuecomment-143297808","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/221","id":143297808,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MzI5NzgwOA==","user":{"login":"hachikuji","id":12502538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAyNTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12502538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji","html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-25T17:37:32Z","updated_at":"2015-09-25T17:37:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@guozhangwang Thanks for the comments. It seems like the problem in phase b) is that the coordinator blindly commits the offsets. Does it have to? Couldn't we have the coordinator check if the generation is -1 (the default generation) in order to tell if consumer is using group membership? If the generation is greater than 0, then we could just return ILLEGAL_GENERATION. This obviously wouldn't prevent duplicates, but at least it would prevent this weird state where commits from old generations are accepted.\n\nThat being said, I'm starting to think that persistence ought to be part of the first release. If not, then we should at least consider whether there's a way to prevent duplicates on clean broker shutdown, since that is probably the most common case where the coordinator would need to

the PR body before merging, and the original message is here:\n\n---\n\nSome open questions collected so far on the first patch. Thanks @gwenshap @jkreps @junrao .\n- Topology API: requiring users to instantiate their own Topology class with the overridden build() function is a little awkward. Instead it would be great to let users explicitly build the topology in Main and pass it in as a class:\n\n```\n    Topology myTopology = new TopologyBuilder(defaultDeser)\n                                                 .addProcessor(\"my-processor\", MyProcessor.class, new Source(\"my-source\"))\n                                                 .addProcessor(\"my-other-processor\", MyOtherProcessor.class, \"my-processor\");\n    KafkaStreaming streaming = new KafkaStreaming(config, myTopology);\n   streaming.run();\n```\n\nSo the implementation of KStream.filter look instead like this:\n\n```\n    public KStream<K, V> filter(Predicate<K, V> predicate) {\n        KStreamFilter<K, V> filter = new KStreamFilter<>();\n        topology.addProcessor(KStreamFilter.class, new Configs(\"predicate\", predicate));\n        return this;\n    }\n```\n\nThe advantage is that the user code can now get rid of the whole Topology class with the builder. I think the order of execution for that API is quite unintuitive.\n- We can probably move the forward() function from Processor to ProcessorContext, and split ProcessorContext into two classes, one with all the function calls as commit / send / schedule / forward, and another with the metadata function calls as topic / partition / offset / timestamp.\n- Can we hide the Chooser interface from users? In other words, if users can specify the \"time\" on each fetched messages from Kafka, would a hard-coded MinTimestampMessageChooser be sufficient so that we can move TimestampTracker / RecordQueue / Chooser / RecordCollector / etc all to the internal folders?\n- Shall we split the o.a.k.clients into two folders, with o.a.k.clients.processor in stream? Or should we just remove o.a.k.clients.processor and make everything under o.a.k.stream? In addition, currently there is a cyclic dependency between that two, would better to break it in the end state.\n- Consider moving the external dependencies such as RocksDB into a separate jar? For example we can just include a kafka-stream-rocksdb.jar which includes the RocksDBKeyValueStore only, and later on when we deprecate / remove such implementations we can simply remove the jar itself.\n- The way the KeyValueStore is created seems a bit weird. Since this is part of the internal state managed by KafkaProcessorContext, it seems there should be an api to create the KeyValueStore from KafkaProcessorContext, instead of passing context to the constructor of KeyValueStore.\n- Merge ProcessorConfigs with ProcessorProperties.\n- We can potentially remove the processor argument in ProcessorContext.schedule().\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/143380723/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/143382585","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/206#issuecomment-143382585","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/206","id":143382585,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MzM4MjU4NQ==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-26T00:24:44Z","updated_at":"2015-09-26T00:24:44Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[kafka-trunk-git-pr
