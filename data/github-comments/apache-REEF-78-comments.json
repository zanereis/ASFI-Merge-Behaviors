But \n`ResourceManagerStatus` calls `onPotentiallyIdle()` from `onRMRunning()` which itself aquires lock on `ResourceManagerStatus` first.\n\nEach of these code paths is executed in a separate thread. PR #1007 which was our initial suspect just moved the check from event handlers into a separate thread, so even before that there were two threads. \nDeadlock would occur if call from `ResourceManagerStatus` competes with one of the other calls \n(that's why deadlock frequency increased after #1007 - the checks from resource manager and from event handlers occur very close in time to each other, and previously the check only competed with the clock). \n\nThe fix removes the lock from `onRMRunning()`, so that all checks don't hold any extra locks before calling

Also this timer-based lifecycle manager could be useful to implement other scenarios in driver. For instance: job suspend/resume, stage timeouts ((hence generic name for the class)).\nif we want keep driver configuration to be purely event driven, this implementation can be moved to the client: we can expose Observable<IJobCancelled> in the job definition and have client do the pulling implementation.\nThoughts?\n\n/Andrey\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/256126608/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/256172668","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/1164#issuecomment-256172668","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/1164","id":256172668,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NjE3MjY2OA==","user":{"login":"tcNickolas","id":10113024,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTEzMDI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10113024?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas","html_url":"https://github.com/tcNickolas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-25T20:54:22Z","updated_at":"2016-10-25T20:54:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"How would driver after restart know what driver before restart did?

Then in all the functions of all the classes with the exception of `Visit` function we will simply call the underlying functions in `ImmutableMetricsImpl`.
