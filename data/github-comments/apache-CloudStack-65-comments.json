digging in a bit more, I've debugged the browser session when hitting the home page with `session=\"false\"` what I see is that the page is not even completely downloaded. My best guess is that the server stops responding when the exceptions I've posted in the previous comment happen. And because the page was not completely downloaded it is also not well rendered. In addition the script tags are at the end of the page, so none of the dynamics will work either.\n\nResearching for similar problems took me to a stackoverflow question\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/2055502/java-lang-illegalstateexception-pwc3999-cannot-create-a-session-after-the-resp?answertab=active#tab-top\n\nIn the accepted answer, the poster explains that the exception (which is the same as I see, \"Cannot create a session after the response has been committed\") has to do with trying to write to a response that has be already committed (i.e. already sent to the client). The poster also mentions that the response is automatically flushed (i.e. sent to the client) when it reached a size of 2K (I assume 2K bytes). Then looking at the size of the html generated for the ACS home page one can easily see that it is way larger than the 2K (actually it is 226K large).\n\nWhile not being an expert on these matters, it seems to me that the culprit is the sheer size and complexity of this webpage. How it actually works with our the `session=\"false\"` declaration is a mystery to me.\n\nping @K0zka (just to make sure you get all the info)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/152490396/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/152491165","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/961#issuecomment-152491165","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/961","id":152491165,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MjQ5MTE2NQ==","user":{"login":"eriweb","id":6181934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxODE5MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6181934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eriweb","html_url":"https://github.com/eriweb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eriweb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eriweb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eriweb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eriweb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eriweb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eriweb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eriweb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eriweb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eriweb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-30T10:49:08Z","updated_at":"2015-10-30T10:49:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"just

I haven't pushed new work to this PR yet, I do have a prototype of what I intend to do, and am looking for thoughts on it here.\n\nMy plan:\n- Move MachineNameService and UUID manager into one interface. Remove the methods from VirtualMachineNameService which are not used. Call this interface ResourceNamingPolicy.\n- Create a ResourceNamingPolicy extension registry, and a new module + impl for the default naming policy (which is the UUIDs ACS generates at the moment).\n- When using methods from ResourceNamingPolicy, iterate through all registered policies until one returns a name that is not null. This is in line with other things like API authenticators, host planners, etc.\n- Expand the use of the ResourceNamingPolicy beyond virtual machines and volumes (which is what VirtualMachineName/UUIDManager touch currently). The plan is to make use of this for these entities to begin with: VMs, volumes, templates, security groups.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/152513166/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/152516868","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/988#issuecomment-152516868","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/988","id":152516868,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MjUxNjg2OA==","user":{"login":"DaanHoogland","id":2486961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODY5NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2486961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland","html_url":"https://github.com/DaanHoogland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-30T13:00:59Z","updated_at":"2015-10-30T13:00:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ProjectMoon
