The std::round of -2.5 is -3. Therefore, for negative numbers the rounder is not 0.5, its actually decimal equivalent of 0.0111111b (the number is represented in 2's complement). This brings in lot more new instructions.

For \"ceil\", we could just add a 0.5 rounding without worrying about negative values. For \"round', we can be more precise. By default, we can choose \"ceil\". What do you think?\r\n> \r\n> Update - Maybe not, \"ceil\" is confusing. Let me think and come up with better terms (like round-away-from-zero etc.).\r\n\r\nIf your round is the concept of my previous comment, maybe `round` is better and is the same as TFLite. IMO, if we couldn't get the same result of TFLite, we can not know where is wrong when the model is large and we could have problem when we deploy it in industry environment.

Why VNNI requires this? Like TFLite, data and kernel both are u8. If VNNI requires this, TFLite's quantized model can not get HW-supported instruction.\r\n\r\nGood question. I am not entirely sure about what Relay operations to perform. But, the key idea is to shift the zero point by subtracting/adding 128 to the quantized tensor values.

That grouped by `mxnet.sym.group()` . Maybe the error caused by the below code in this PR, which tuple the `graph.body`. The model can work normally with `graph memory planner` on master or old version. Do you have any suggestion to fix this in my case? Or how to avoid this by modify my model ? :\r\n```python\r\n        graph = relay.Function(graph.params,\r\n                                relay.expr.Tuple([graph.body]+additional_outputs))\r\n        target = 'llvm -mcpu=core-avx2'\r\n        #target = 'cuda'\r\n        with relay.build_config(opt_level=0):\r\n            graph, lib, params = relay.build(graph, target)\r\n            ctx = tvm.nd.context(target)\r\n```\r\nBy the way, **The target of above code is to collect all internal outputs for activation calibration. building in the below way can work normally in my case.** Can this error be fixed by replacing the code with below's ?\r\n```python\r\n    quantize_op = _op.get(\"relay.op.annotation.simulated_quantize\")\r\n    quantized_exprs = []\r\n\r\n    print('calibrate graph')\r\n    print(graph)\r\n    def visit_func(expr):\r\n        \"\"\"Internal visit function\"\"\"\r\n        if isinstance(expr, _expr.Call) and expr.op == quantize_op and expr.attrs.kind not in [QAnnotateKind.WEIGHT, QAnnotateKind.BIAS]:\r\n            quantized_exprs.append(expr.args[0])\r\n\r\n    _ir_pass.post_order_visit(graph, visit_func)\r\n    if len(quantized_exprs) == 0:\r\n        return []\r\n    graph = _expr.Function(graph.params, _expr.Tuple(quantized_exprs))\r\n\r\n    graph_json, lib, params = _build.build(graph, 'cuda')\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/510901602/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/510926286","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/3533#issuecomment-510926286","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3533","id":510926286,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMDkyNjI4Ng==","user":{"login":"kparzysz-quic","id":48801706,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4ODAxNzA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48801706?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic","html_url":"https://github.com/kparzysz-quic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-12T15:19:21Z","updated_at":"2019-07-12T15:19:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Is this an effort to replace the Halide IR with something else?
