Just throwing a thought out there: I have found that there are a lot of arguably hidden assumptions and contracts in Spark SQL and they turn out to be tricky to spot for newcomers (e.g. me ;)).

For instance, (again a very rudimentary thought), we could make the output of planner and prepareForExecution have different types, and make `execution.ExplainCommand` only accept the former and not the latter.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/46469383/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/46469732","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1116#issuecomment-46469732","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1116","id":46469732,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NDY5NzMy","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-06-18T17:50:22Z","updated_at":"2014-06-18T17:50:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"That's not a bad idea.

not sure this solution is really doing what we want.  The `sparkPlan` should not be used as the explain output since it won't contain `Exchange` operators.  The only reason this is still producing the correct answer is because we are using the `executePlan` of the `Explain` operator, so a pass is still done to add `Exchange` operators.\n\nReally, the core problem is that `AddExchange` is not idempotent because it is not correctly detecting when the inputPartitioning is already correct.  This is a more serious bug as it could significantly hurt performance.\n\nThe root cause is related to the way that we bind attributes to specific ordinals in the input schema.  Right now, for some operators this is done by the `BindReferences` rule (the original solution) and for others its done through the creation of a Projection (the new, better solution that is faster and acts as the interface for codegen).  The issue with the old solution is that BoundAttributeReferences can't correctly handle equality, hence the issue with AddExchange.\n\nI propose we do this:\n- Revert this change and fix Exchange to use the new method for binding to an input schema [Solution Here](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1122).\n- In a follow up PR remove BindReferences.\n\n> As the codebase grows, should we consider using type-level constraints to enforce some of these constraints?\n\nI'm generally in favor of this approach, but I think in the instance of trees its going to be pretty hard to do.  This is because often you want to be able to create trees that start off semantically invalid, but are then `fixed` through resolution.  One thing we could add a set of invariant checks that run at various phases and let us know anytime something is amiss (adjacent `Exchange` operators for example).\n\nMore docs are also always a good idea :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/46507895/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/46510367","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1090#issuecomment-46510367","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1090","id":46510367,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NTEwMzY3","user":{"login":"pwendell","id":320616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDYxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/320616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell","html_url":"https://github.com/pwendell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-06-19T00:13:22Z","updated_at":"2014-06-19T00:16:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hey @msiddalingaiah - in some cases more than one person will submit solutions for a patch. The assignments on JIRA are just tentative, we don't consider them an exclusive reservation. In this case @aarondav assigned this task to you on May 27th. Then someone else submitted a fix on May 31st. Your patch showed up on June 14th.\n\nWhen this happens we just try to take the best patch out there and in this case #931 is in better shape than this patch.
