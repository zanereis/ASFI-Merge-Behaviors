I ran the word count test I wrote as a part of #805 on a 35 node storm cluster.  This was done against several different storm versions, the baseline in the #805 pull request; this patch + #805 (batch-v2); and #694 + #805 + modifications to use the hybrid approach to enable acking and batch to work in a multi-process topology (STORM-855).  To avoid having all of the numbers be hard to parse I am just going to include some charts, but if anyone wants to see the raw numbers or reproduce it themselves I am happy to provide data and/or branches.\n\nThe numbers below were collected after the topology had been running for at least 200 seconds.  This is to avoid startup issues like JIT etc.  I filtered out any 30 second interval where the measured throughput was not +/- 10% of the target throughput on the assumption that if the topology cannot keep up with the desired throughput or it was trying to catch up from previous slowness it would not be within that range.  I did not filter based off of the number of failures that happened, simply because that would have resulted in removing all of the STORM-855 with batching enabled results.  None of the other test configurations saw any failures at all during testing.\n\n![throughput-vs-latency](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3441321/10644336/d0393222-77ed-11e5-849a-0b6be6ac5178.png)\n\nThis shows the 99%-ile latency vs measured throughput.  It is not too interesting except to note that batching in STORM-855 at low throughput resulted in nothing being fully processed.  All of the tuples timed out before they could finish.  Only at a medium throughput above 16,000 sentences/second were we able to maintain enough tuples to complete batches regularly, but even then many tuples would still time out. This should be able to be fixed with a batch timeout, but that is not implemented yet.\n\nTo get a better view I adjusted the latency to be a log scale.\n\n![throughput-vs-latency-log](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3441321/10644335/d02ab29c-77ed-11e5-883e-a647f6b4279b.png)\n\nFrom this we can see that on the very low end batching-v2 is increasing the 99%-ile latency from 5-10 ms to 19-21 ms.  Most of that you can get back by configuring the batch size to 1, instead of the default 100 tuples.  However, once the baseline stops functioning at around 7000 sentences/sec the batching code is able to continue working, with either a batch size of 1 or 100.  I believe that this has to do with the automatic backpressure.  In the baseline code backpressure does not take into account the overflow buffer, but in the batching code it does.  I think this gives the topology more stability in maintaining a throughput, but I don't have any solid evidence for that.\n\nI then zoomed in on the graphs to show what a 2 second SLA would look like\n\n![throughput-vs-latency-2-sec](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3441321/10644332/d0176f5c-77ed-11e5-98c4-d2e7a9e48c70.png)\n\nand a 100 ms SLA.\n\n![throughput-vs-latency-100-ms](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3441321/10644334/d0291540-77ed-11e5-9fb3-9c9c97f504f9.png)\n\nIn both cases the batching v2 with a batch size of 100 was able to handle the highest throughput for that given latency.\n\nThen I wanted to look at memory and CPU Utilization.\n\n![throughput-vs-mem](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3441321/10644337/d03c3094-77ed-11e5-8cda-cf53fe3a2389.png)\n\nMemory does not show much, the amount of memory used varies a bit from one to the other, but if you realize this is for 35 worker processes it is varying from 70 MB/worker to about 200 MB/worker.  The numbers simply show that as the throughput increases the memory utilizations does too, and it does not vary too much from one implementation to another.\n\n![throughput-vs-cpu](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3441321/10645834/6ba799e0-77f5-11e5-88fd-7e09475a5b6c.png)\n\nCPU however shows that on the low end we are going from 7 or 8 cores worth of CPU time to about 35 cores worth for the batching code.  This seems to be the result of the batch flushing threads waking up periodically.  We should be able to mitigate this by adjusting that interval to be larger, but that would in turn impact the latency.\n\nI believe that with further work we should be able to reduce that CPU utilization and the latency on the low end by dynamically adjusting the batch size and timeout based off of a specified SLA.  At this point I feel this branch is ready for a formal review and inclusion into storm, the drawbacks to this patch do not seem to out weigh the clear advantages to it.  Additionally with the stability problems associated with #694 I cannot feel good in recommending it at this time.   It is clear that some of what it is doing is worthwhile, and I think we should explore the alternative batch serialization between worker processes as a potential stand alone piece.\n\n@d2r @knusbaum @kishorvpatil @harshach @HeartSaVioR @ptgoetz \n\nIf you could please review this remembering that it is based off of #797, I would like to try and get this in soon.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/149987537/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612563782","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4695#issuecomment-2612563782","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4695","id":2612563782,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI1NjM3ODI=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-21T18:34:33Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T13:44:00Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=githubbot\">githubbot</a>:</i>\n<p>Github user revans2 commented on the pull request:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/765#issuecomment-149987537\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/765#issuecomment-149987537</a></p>\n\n<p>    So I have been running a number of tests trying to come to a conclusive decision on how storm should handle batching, and trying to understand the difference between my test results and the test results from #694.

None of the other test configurations saw any failures at all during testing.</p>\n\n<p>    !<span class=\"error\">&#91;throughput-vs-latency&#93;</span>(<a href=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3441321/10644336/d0393222-77ed-11e5-849a-0b6be6ac5178.png\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3441321/10644336/d0393222-77ed-11e5-849a-0b6be6ac5178.png</a>)</p>\n\n<p>    This shows the 99%-ile latency vs measured throughput.  It is not too interesting except to note that batching in <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-855\" title=\"Add tuple batching\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"STORM-855\"><del>STORM-855</del></a> at low throughput resulted in nothing being fully processed.  All of the tuples timed out before they could finish.  Only at a medium throughput above 16,000 sentences/second were we able to maintain enough tuples to complete batches regularly, but even then many tuples would still time out. This should be able to be fixed with a batch timeout, but that is not implemented yet.</p>\n\n<p>    To get a better view I adjusted the latency to be a log scale.</p>\n\n<p>    !<span class=\"error\">&#91;throughput-vs-latency-log&#93;</span>(<a href=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3441321/10644335/d02ab29c-77ed-11e5-883e-a647f6b4279b.png\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3441321/10644335/d02ab29c-77ed-11e5-883e-a647f6b4279b.png</a>)</p>\n\n<p>    From this we can see that on the very low end batching-v2 is increasing the 99%-ile latency from 5-10 ms to 19-21 ms.  Most of that you can get back by configuring the batch size to 1, instead of the default 100 tuples.  However, once the baseline stops functioning at around 7000 sentences/sec the batching code is able to continue working, with either a batch size of 1 or 100.  I believe that this has to do with the automatic backpressure.  In the baseline code backpressure does not take into account the overflow buffer, but in the batching code it does.  I think this gives the topology more stability in maintaining a throughput, but I don't have any solid evidence for that.</p>\n\n<p>    I then zoomed in on the graphs to show what a 2 second SLA would look like</p>\n\n<p>    !<span class=\"error\">&#91;throughput-vs-latency-2-sec&#93;</span>(<a href=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3441321/10644332/d0176f5c-77ed-11e5-98c4-d2e7a9e48c70.png\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3441321/10644332/d0176f5c-77ed-11e5-98c4-d2e7a9e48c70.png</a>)</p>\n\n<p>    and a 100 ms SLA.</p>\n\n<p>    !<span class=\"error\">&#91;throughput-vs-latency-100-ms&#93;</span>(<a href=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3441321/10644334/d0291540-77ed-11e5-9fb3-9c9c97f504f9.png\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3441321/10644334/d0291540-77ed-11e5-9fb3-9c9c97f504f9.png</a>)</p>\n\n<p>    In both cases the batching v2 with a batch size of 100 was able to handle the highest throughput for that given latency.</p>\n\n<p>    Then I wanted to look at memory and CPU Utilization.</p>\n\n<p>    !<span class=\"error\">&#91;throughput-vs-mem&#93;</span>(<a href=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3441321/10644337/d03c3094-77ed-11e5-8cda-cf53fe3a2389.png\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3441321/10644337/d03c3094-77ed-11e5-8cda-cf53fe3a2389.png</a>)</p>\n\n<p>    Memory does not show much, the amount of memory used varies a bit from one to the other, but if you realize this is for 35 worker processes it is varying from 70 MB/worker to about 200 MB/worker.  The numbers simply show that as the throughput increases the memory utilizations does too, and it does not vary too much from one implementation to another.</p>\n\n<p>    !<span class=\"error\">&#91;throughput-vs-cpu&#93;</span>(<a href=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3441321/10645834/6ba799e0-77f5-11e5-88fd-7e09475a5b6c.png\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3441321/10645834/6ba799e0-77f5-11e5-88fd-7e09475a5b6c.png</a>)</p>\n\n<p>    CPU however shows that on the low end we are going from 7 or 8 cores worth of CPU time to about 35 cores worth for the batching code.  This seems to be the result of the batch flushing threads waking up periodically.  We should be able to mitigate this by adjusting that interval to be larger, but that would in turn impact the latency.</p>\n\n<p>    I believe that with further work we should be able to reduce that CPU utilization and the latency on the low end by dynamically adjusting the batch size and timeout based off of a specified SLA.  At this point I feel this branch is ready for a formal review and inclusion into storm, the drawbacks to this patch do not seem to out weigh the clear advantages to it.  Additionally with the stability problems associated with #694 I cannot feel good in recommending it at this time.   It is clear that some of what it is doing is worthwhile, and I think we should explore the alternative batch serialization between worker processes as a potential stand alone piece.</p>\n\n<p>    @d2r @knusbaum @kishorvpatil @harshach @HeartSaVioR @ptgoetz </p>\n\n<p>    If you could please review this remembering that it is based off of #797, I would like to try and get this in soon.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612563782/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612612851","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4959#issuecomment-2612612851","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4959","id":2612612851,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI2MTI4NTE=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-21T18:54:57Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T14:06:08Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=githubbot\">githubbot</a>:</i>\n<p>Github user revans2 commented on a diff in the pull request:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/810#discussion_r42666392\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/810#discussion_r42666392</a></p>\n\n<p>    &#8212; Diff: storm-core/test/clj/backtype/storm/integration_test.clj &#8212;<br/>\n    @@ -236,6 +237,7 @@<br/>\n  \"acking-test1\"<br/>\n  {}<br/>\n  (:topology tracked))<br/>\n    +      (Thread/sleep 11000)<br/>\n    &#8212; End diff &#8211;</p>\n\n<p>    Is there a way we can force mk-assignments to be called?

Not sure if this i acceptable behavior and/or what other metrics are there that cannot be updated in a \"batch\" fashion... count might be a too simple example.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/150255113/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612611520","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4949#issuecomment-2612611520","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4949","id":2612611520,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI2MTE1MjA=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-22T16:23:39Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T14:05:28Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=githubbot\">githubbot</a>:</i>\n<p>Github user jerrypeng commented on a diff in the pull request:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/807#discussion_r42770783\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/807#discussion_r42770783</a></p>\n\n<p>    &#8212; Diff: storm-core/src/jvm/backtype/storm/Config.java &#8212;<br/>\n    @@ -247,6 +253,7 @@<br/>\n  *</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Defaults to false.<br/>\n  */<br/>\n    +    @Deprecated\n\t<ul class=\"alternate\" type=\"square\">\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<ul class=\"alternate\" type=\"square\">\n\t\t\t<li>End diff &#8211;</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>    will remove deprecated annotation</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612611520/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612611527","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4949#issuecomment-2612611527","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4949","id":2612611527,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI2MTE1Mjc=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-22T16:24:36Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T14:05:29Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=githubbot\">githubbot</a>:</i>\n<p>Github user jerrypeng commented on a diff in the pull request:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/807#discussion_r42770893\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/807#discussion_r42770893</a></p>\n\n<p>    &#8212; Diff: storm-core/src/jvm/backtype/storm/Config.java &#8212;<br/>\n    @@ -1215,6 +1254,7 @@</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>to be equal to the number of workers configured for this topology.

Hi @d2r,\n> Could you please review this PR? Your response is highly appreciated. Thanks.\n\nFirstly, nice job handling the stats.clj upmerge.  That is not the nicest code to work with.\n\nMy thoughts on this:\n\nThe Storm UI does not function like a history server; it only shows us what is currently running.  If a worker crashes, then those stats are lost to us.\n\nWith the way the current Storm UI works, if a worker is relaunched, then the stats for its executors are presented as if the executors all have been up for the same duration.\n\n[The change](https://github.com/wangli1426/storm/blob/1b0598485adb298d1e008b82ecda706d5996721f/storm-core/src/clj/backtype/storm/stats.clj#L286-L289) weights the throughput rates based upon the time the executor has been running.  This could be good, but it has its own problems.  If the previous worker's throughput stats had declined sharply before the worker had died, then weighting the current worker's throughput stats still would be inaccurate, but in a different way. Also, the throughput stats would look really confusing compared to the other stats, which are not weighted this way.\n\nSolving the lost stats problem should be part of other work that perhaps creates a History Server for Storm to keep historical information, including some of these lost stats.\n\nIt seems to me the current UI is handling it one way (all executors have been up for the same duration) and the patch handles it another (stats weighted by executor's actual uptime).  For now, until we get a true history server, I think there is value in keeping the UI self-consistent.  I do not think we want to present aggregated throughput numbers that do not correspond to Emitted numbers for a window.\n\nThe simple way to do this would be to divide Emitted by the minimum of Topology Uptime & Window.  If we did it this way, it would keep the UI consistent, and it could be as simple as changing the JavaScript to do a simple divide in the browser.

That is not the nicest code to work with.</p>\n\n\n<p>    My thoughts on this:</p>\n\n<p>    The Storm UI does not function like a history server; it only shows us what is currently running.  If a worker crashes, then those stats are lost to us.</p>\n\n<p>    With the way the current Storm UI works, if a worker is relaunched, then the stats for its executors are presented as if the executors all have been up for the same duration.</p>\n\n<p>    <span class=\"error\">&#91;The change&#93;</span>(<a href=\"https://github.com/wangli1426/storm/blob/1b0598485adb298d1e008b82ecda706d5996721f/storm-core/src/clj/backtype/storm/stats.clj#L286-L289\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/wangli1426/storm/blob/1b0598485adb298d1e008b82ecda706d5996721f/storm-core/src/clj/backtype/storm/stats.clj#L286-L289</a>) weights the throughput rates based upon the time the executor has been running.  This could be good, but it has its own problems.  If the previous worker's throughput stats had declined sharply before the worker had died, then weighting the current worker's throughput stats still would be inaccurate, but in a different way. Also, the throughput stats would look really confusing compared to the other stats, which are not weighted this way.</p>\n\n<p>    Solving the lost stats problem should be part of other work that perhaps creates a History Server for Storm to keep historical information, including some of these lost stats.</p>\n\n<p>    It seems to me the current UI is handling it one way (all executors have been up for the same duration) and the patch handles it another (stats weighted by executor's actual uptime).  For now, until we get a true history server, I think there is value in keeping the UI self-consistent.  I do not think we want to present aggregated throughput numbers that do not correspond to Emitted numbers for a window.</p>\n\n<p>    The simple way to do this would be to divide Emitted by the minimum of Topology Uptime & Window.  If we did it this way, it would keep the UI consistent, and it could be as simple as changing the JavaScript to do a simple divide in the browser.  This way we would not need to change Storm system code or update the thrift serialization.</p>\n\n<p>    And as @harshac mentioned, we could add another JavaScript change to show a simple topology-wide throughput in the same way.</p>\n\n<p>    What do you think?</p>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612603019/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612613305","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4962#issuecomment-2612613305","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4962","id":2612613305,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI2MTMzMDU=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-22T18:48:03Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T14:06:22Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a

I think it shows flag is not needed.\n\nWhat do you think?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/150367335/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/150367444","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/454#issuecomment-150367444","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/454","id":150367444,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MDM2NzQ0NA==","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-22T21:56:36Z","updated_at":"2015-10-22T21:56:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Otherwise looks good overall.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/150367444/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612613439","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4963#issuecomment-2612613439","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4963","id":2612613439,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI2MTM0Mzk=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-22T22:31:17Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T14:06:27Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=githubbot\">githubbot</a>:</i>\n<p>Github user HeartSaVioR commented on a diff in the pull request:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/813#discussion_r42814836\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/813#discussion_r42814836</a></p>\n\n<p>    &#8212; Diff: storm-core/src/clj/backtype/storm/cluster.clj &#8212;<br/>\n    @@ -54,6 +54,10 @@<br/>\n (when (Utils/isZkAuthenticationConfiguredTopology topo-conf)<br/>\n   [(first ZooDefs$Ids/CREATOR_ALL_ACL)<br/>\n    (ACL.

StormSQL.</p>\n\n<p>Pros:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Mature optimization from LLVM</li>\n\t<li>Auto vectorization</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>Cons:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Nontrivial to compile LLVM back to Java source code, especially preserving the effects of vectorization</li>\n\t<li>Native code</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>The main question is that whether the LLVM based approach can deliver more performance. To answer the question I wrote a benchmark that filters and counts a continuous stream of 32-bit integers. The integers are grouped in a batch of 8.</p>\n\n<p>I ran three experiments:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Native: the filter is compiled to native code with vectorization turned on. The worker runs the code via JNI.</li>\n\t<li>Without boxing: the filter gets the integers by accessing specific offsets of the bytearray. There is no serialization overhead.</li>\n\t<li>With boxing: the filter first deserializes the bytearray to <tt>Values</tt>. The filter casts the <tt>Object</tt> to <tt>Integer</tt> during filtering.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>I ran the experiment on an early-2013 Macbook Pro to filter 20 millions integers for 10 times. Here is the result (Time in milliseconds):</p>\n\n<div class=\"preformatted panel\" style=\"border-width: 1px;\"><div class=\"preformattedContent panelContent\">\n<pre>native\nTime: 3037\nTime: 3007\nTime: 3178\nTime: 3194\nTime: 3258\nTime: 3170\nTime: 3092\nTime: 3238\nTime: 3125\nTime: 3127\nwithout boxing\nTime: 2272\nTime: 2243\nTime: 2275\nTime: 2084\nTime: 2101\nTime: 2159\nTime: 2176\nTime: 2116\nTime: 2055\nTime: 2174\nwith boxing\nTime: 3132\nTime: 2934\nTime: 2915\nTime: 2902\nTime: 2731\nTime: 2815\nTime: 2834\nTime: 2842\nTime: 2793\nTime: 2849\n</pre>\n</div></div>\n\n<p>The full Java approach w/o boxing delivers the best performance even there is no vectorization in the filter. Therefore it might make sense to delegate the optimization problem to the JIT directly and not having LLVM involved.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612610751/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612610755","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4943#issuecomment-2612610755","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4943","id":2612610755,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI2MTA3NTU=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-23T00:18:04Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T14:05:07Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=githubbot\">githubbot</a>:</i>\n<p>Github user haohui closed the pull request at:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/796\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/796</a></p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612610755/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612609529","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4935#issuecomment-2612609529","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4935","id":2612609529,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI2MDk1Mjk=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-23T06:30:41Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T14:04:33Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=githubbot\">githubbot</a>:</i>\n<p>GitHub user haohui opened a pull request:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/814\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/814</a></p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-1097\" title=\"Compile logical plans to Java source code\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"STORM-1097\"><del>STORM-1097</del></a>.
