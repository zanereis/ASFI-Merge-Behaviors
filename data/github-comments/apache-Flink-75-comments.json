\n1. I have introduced a separate directory for uploads, named randomly, and deleted as part of the shut down hook. \n2. I also tried closing the `URLClassLoader`, but it still doesn't allow for the Jars to be deleted. I will look further into it and see if I can get it to work. It shouldn't be a blocker however for merging this IMO. \n\n@StephanEwen \n1. I have removed the key to specify the upload directory, which takes care of naming of the config entry. It now is just `jobmanager.web.submit.allow`\n2. What would be the best way to separate the passing of path and query parameters? Of course, the most obvious choice is to change the method signature for `handleRequest` but it appears too much of a change, just to allow query params. Since the interface is designed by us, I think we can keep them together, and disallow any query param which overrides the path param. Otherwise, if we do indeed change this, I suggest a construct `Parameters` with fields `pathParams` and `queryParams`, with access method as `getParam(key, enum{PATH, QUERY})` This will be a much cleaner solution.\n3. I have some concerns about error handling. There are four handlers: \n  a. `StaticFileServerHandler`: Handles exception events itself, by sending an `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`\n  b. `RuntimeMonitorHandler`: Handles all exceptions itself, with either a `NOT_FOUND` or `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` code.\n  c. `HttpRequestHandler` [introduced in this PR]: Doesn't handler exceptions. But I'm inclined towards sending an `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` code for any exceptions here.\n  d. `PipelineErrorHandler` [introduced in this PR]: If an exception caught event is fired here, it can only happen because the netty threw an error [as reported by @gyfora in an instance]. There's really nothing to do here except sending an internal server error.\nWhat do you think?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/158765098/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/158765143","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1097#issuecomment-158765143","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1097","id":158765143,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1ODc2NTE0Mw==","user":{"login":"rmetzger","id":89049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger","html_url":"https://github.com/rmetzger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-22T14:58:50Z","updated_at":"2015-11-22T14:58:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've tested the PR again. \nI found a minor issue with the alternative arguments.\ninput: `--input abc --p 12`,\ncode:\n\n``` java\nRequiredParameters rq = new RequiredParameters();\n        rq.add(\"input\");\n        rq.add(new Option(\"parallelism\").alt(\"p\").defaultValue(\"1\").type(OptionType.INTEGER));\n        ParameterTool pt = ParameterTool.fromArgs(args);\n        rq.applyTo(pt);\n\n        String in = pt.get(\"input\");\n        System.out.println(\"In = \"+in + \" parallelism = \"+pt.getInt(\"parallelism\") + \" p=\"+pt.getInt(\"p\"));\n\n        System.exit(0);\n```\n\nerror \n\n```\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.RuntimeException: No data for required key 'p'\n    at org.apache.flink.api.java.utils.ParameterTool.getRequired(ParameterTool.java:236)\n    at org.apache.flink.api.java.utils.ParameterTool.getInt(ParameterTool.java:272)\n    at org.apache.flink.examples.java.wordcount.WordCount.main(WordCount.java:69)\n```\n\nI think we need to set the (default) value for the long and the short variant.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/158765143/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/158765658","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1387#issuecomment-158765658","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1387","id":158765658,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1ODc2NTY1OA==","user":{"login":"mxm","id":837221,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNzIyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/837221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm","html_url":"https://github.com/mxm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-22T15:10:42Z","updated_at":"2015-11-22T15:10:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Maybe a stupid question but why don't you send the operator name along with the BoltWrapper?

I guess the compaction part is the most interesting here.\n\nthanks\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/158799081/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/158838162","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1349#issuecomment-158838162","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1349","id":158838162,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1ODgzODE2Mg==","user":{"login":"gallenvara","id":12931563,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTMxNTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12931563?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gallenvara","html_url":"https://github.com/gallenvara","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gallenvara/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gallenvara/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gallenvara/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gallenvara/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gallenvara/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gallenvara/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gallenvara/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gallenvara/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gallenvara/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-23T02:44:39Z","updated_at":"2015-11-23T02:44:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi, @chiwanpark .

So we do not port this one.\nI also agree to remove the checks for empty arguments in the `PreviewPlanDumpTest`. This requires cooperation of the job, i.e., the job may not fail for empty arguments, and tests exactly the same code paths as the tests with arguments, as far as I see.\n\nHowever, I do not think that the `ClassLoaderITCase` which calls the `KMeansForTest` is a good replacement for the `IterativeKMeansITCase`. The programs are identical but, the `ClassLoaderITCase` only checks if the program executes without an error and does not check the result.\n\n@zentol Is it OK for you if I add this one last test and merge this PR afterwards?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/159223361/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/159224189","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1387#issuecomment-159224189","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1387","id":159224189,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1OTIyNDE4OQ==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-24T10:33:32Z","updated_at":"2015-11-24T10:33:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mjsax Okay, I probably misread the original code.
