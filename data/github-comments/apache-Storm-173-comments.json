The documentation in `RotatingMap` is actually incorrect, and I'd support changing it in this PR. </p>\n\n<p>    Why is it exactly that we want to remove `TimeCacheMap`? All it is is a thread-safe, self-rotating wrapper around `RotatingMap`, which looks convenient.</p>\n\n<p>    Given it's not anywhere near the critical path, I don't see a problem with having a synchronized data structure. </p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612870069/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/182624697","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1092#issuecomment-182624697","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1092","id":182624697,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MjYyNDY5Nw==","user":{"login":"dossett","id":7207582,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyMDc1ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7207582?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett","html_url":"https://github.com/dossett","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-10T23:00:43Z","updated_at":"2016-02-10T23:00:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ah, thanks.
