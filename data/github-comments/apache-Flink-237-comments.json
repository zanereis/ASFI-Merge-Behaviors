think that timeouts in IDE are only making things worse:\r\n1. you can not debug, since longer debugging session will fail \r\n2. in case of deadlocks, locally you can always manually dump/view stack traces but you also can do full thread/memory dump and/or attach a debugger.\r\n\r\nOn travis you can not debug it in any way, thus automated actions make sense (and they preserve some travis resources for other builds). \r\n\r\nFurthermore, such rule would have to be implemented in all of our tests, not only here. Also IMO if you want to replace/remove `travis_mvn_watchdog` with such rule, this is out of scope of this ticket and it should be discussed separately (I would be against it), so that it doesn't hinder this ticket.\r\n\r\nWhen I originally created those tests (with `@Test(timeout = xxxx)`) I did it by copying without thinking from a test, that was printing something to logs once every checkpoint, thus it was interrupting travis watchdog and one could argue that it required this special case timeout. This commit makes it more consistent with rest of the tests.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/374246353/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/374246712","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/5710#issuecomment-374246712","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/5710","id":374246712,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NDI0NjcxMg==","user":{"login":"pnowojski","id":8957547,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NTc1NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8957547?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski","html_url":"https://github.com/pnowojski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-19T15:11:10Z","updated_at":"2018-03-19T15:11:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"thanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/374246712/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/374250640","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/5708#issuecomment-374250640","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/5708","id":374250640,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NDI1MDY0MA==","user":{"login":"pnowojski","id":8957547,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NTc1NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8957547?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski","html_url":"https://github.com/pnowojski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-19T15:21:38Z","updated_at":"2018-03-19T15:21:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yes,

I see the problem of debugging tests that have timeouts, but removing timeouts altogether is the wrong conclusion imo. Instead, we could implement the `Timeout` such that it doesn't fail the test if a certain profile/property is set.\r\n\r\nWith this we keep the benefits of test timeouts (CI service independence, less special behavior locally vs CI, fixed upper bound for test times which is particularly useful for new tests, \"guarantee\" that the test terminates) while still allowing debugging. In fact we may end up improving the debugging situation by consolidating how timeouts are implemented instead of each test rolling their own solution that you can't disable.\r\n\r\nThe travis watchdog _cannot_ be removed as it covers the entire maven process that from time to time locks up outside of tests. That said, the fact that we have to rely on the travis watchdog _to ensure that tests terminate_ is a bad sign. Not to mention that it already forced us to introduce workarounds to make tests \"compatible\", like the kafka tests and others that print stuff for the sole purposes of not triggering it.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/374333880/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/374457996","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/5723#issuecomment-374457996","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/5723","id":374457996,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NDQ1Nzk5Ng==","user":{"login":"yanghua","id":2283778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODM3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2283778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua","html_url":"https://github.com/yanghua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-20T03:08:31Z","updated_at":"2018-03-20T03:08:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"cc @tillrohrmann ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/374457996/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/374467557","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/5580#issuecomment-374467557","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/5580","id":374467557,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NDQ2NzU1Nw==","user":{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-20T04:07:27Z","updated_at":"2018-03-20T04:07:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"So the current state of this PR doesn't work with the Python API because it uploads complete directories?
