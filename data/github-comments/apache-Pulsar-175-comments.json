Also, this is provides duplicate flags which is confusing regardless if the right most one takes. \r\n\r\nIn my opinion bkenv.sh should only be applied to `bin/bookkeeper` and the pulsar_env.sh should only be used in the `bin/pulsar` and other `bin/pulsar-*` scripts. To me loading both is confusing and can lead to unexpected errors or behavior.\r\n\r\nWhy is `PULSAR_MEM` not a good way to set the memory? \r\n`PULSAR_MEM` is used to set the memory for all commands (zookeeper, presto, function-worker, etc..) in the `bin/pulsar` script. It seems clear to me if I run `bin/pulsar` or any `bin/pulsar-*` script I control the memory with `PULSAR_MEM`.  #5675 changes this and makes it inconsistent with how everything else works and that in my opinion is confusing.

implementation of this `SendAndGetMsgID `, right?\r\n\r\n> So it's likely the libpulsar lib on Mac OS. :(\r\n\r\nI agree with you, maybe we can change the way of build cpp lib:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd pulsar-client-cpp\r\ncmake . -DBUILD_TESTS=OFF\r\nmake -j12 && make install\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn 2.4.1 of `libpulsar`, there is no function to `SendAndGetMsgID`, so we can't use it by `brew install libpulsar`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/566360406/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/566362528","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/5872#issuecomment-566362528","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/5872","id":566362528,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NjM2MjUyOA==","user":{"login":"addisonj","id":636291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNjI5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/636291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/addisonj","html_url":"https://github.com/addisonj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/addisonj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/addisonj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/addisonj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/addisonj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/addisonj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/addisonj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/addisonj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/addisonj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/addisonj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-17T03:21:24Z","updated_at":"2019-12-17T03:21:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"rerun
