You can almost think of clear as a way to get the scheduler to re-run what you clear.\n\nYou either clear a failed state after you fix the issue and want it to re-run, or you clear a success state because it was a false positive or something has changed that requires re-running the task.\n\nI'm not sure where to clarify that in the UI / CLI / docs. Let me know if you have input.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/169163981/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/169164409","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/828#issuecomment-169164409","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/828","id":169164409,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2OTE2NDQwOQ==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-05T23:11:37Z","updated_at":"2016-01-05T23:11:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This looks cleaner to me.

I admit I don't fully understand the internals of the scheduler.  But it doesn't necessarily need to a be a binary like `left|right`, though.  Couldn't the dag have a setting called `scheduler_wait` or something that is a `timedelta` that defaults to be equal to the `schedule_interval` but could be set to anything?  The scheduler would just do an extra time calculation to see whether it should trigger a `DagRun` for that dag.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/169512528/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/169518194","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/777#issuecomment-169518194","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/777","id":169518194,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2OTUxODE5NA==","user":{"login":"jihygk","id":6185776,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxODU3NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6185776?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihygk","html_url":"https://github.com/jihygk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihygk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihygk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihygk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihygk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihygk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihygk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihygk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihygk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihygk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-07T01:31:08Z","updated_at":"2016-01-07T01:31:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@toryhaavik I think you can use the TimeDeltaSensor operator for this, although it doesn't currently seem to work with DAGs with no `schedule_interval` parameter.

I guess the difference in convention about 'gaps' in intervals causes the confusion for me.
