toke a look at the https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1956/files,  I don't think `spark`'s `Shim` policy will resolve all flink's incompatibility problem, because not all the incompatibility issues are happen in a single interface (or a separate services).  Currently, we iceberg flink module depends on few `internal` interfaces (such as `RowDataTypeInfo`, it was removed in flink 1.12.0), which does not guarantee the interface compatibility from apache flink.   The correct way is decoupling dependencies on flink's internal API interfaces,  for the `TableColumn` & `RowDataTypeInfo` & `TableResult` issues we may need to change the code design so that we won't depend on those internal API interfaces.  The idea way is: upgrading the flink version from 1.11.x to 1.12.x (passing all checks) without changing one line code.\r\n\r\nAs the iceberg 0.11.0 release is coming,  I'd rather to upgrade the flink version after release get finished, because all currently development and testing work are based on flink 1.11.x.  I'm afraid that upgrading to 1.12.x will introduce extra instability which may delay the 0.11.0 release. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/748746287/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/748883170","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1961#issuecomment-748883170","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1961","id":748883170,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0ODg4MzE3MA==","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-21T09:54:27Z","updated_at":"2020-12-21T09:54:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks, @rdblue!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/748883170/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/748884148","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1965#issuecomment-748884148","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1965","id":748884148,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0ODg4NDE0OA==","user":{"login":"marton-bod","id":19599214,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTk5MjE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19599214?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marton-bod","html_url":"https://github.com/marton-bod","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marton-bod/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marton-bod/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marton-bod/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marton-bod/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marton-bod/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marton-bod/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marton-bod/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marton-bod/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marton-bod/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-21T09:56:25Z","updated_at":"2020-12-21T09:56:25Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Looks good to me too.

If the global sort is disabled, we still need to perform a local sort. We will need to think about a proper name for the property but we can do this later. Seeing what performance penalty a global sort can introduce inside MERGE statements, I'd recommend not doing this by default but I can be convinced otherwise.\r\n\r\n> For sorting by _file and _pos, what if we only did that for existing rows? We can discard the columns for updated rows. That way we rewrite the data files as though the rows were deleted and append the inserts and updates together. We may even want to do this in all cases: always prepend _file and _pos to whatever sort order we inject.\r\n\r\nI think this is promising if we can easily nullify `_file` and `_pos` for updated rows and if Spark range estimation will do what we hope.

That means that we won't need different implementations for v2, but it also means that we can avoid scanning the extra partitions in the future. Because this is fixed before v2, we can ensure that all v2 tables have been fixed. So if a table is created as v2, we should be able to know that no older writers with the bug have written to the table. The only case where a v2 table would have bad metadata is when a v1 table has been converted. We should add a flag to signal that the table was converted from v1 or one that signals it was created as v2 that allows us to skip the extra partitions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/751026580/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/751031371","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/1980#issuecomment-751031371","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1980","id":751031371,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1MTAzMTM3MQ==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-24T21:00:29Z","updated_at":"2020-12-24T21:00:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sounds like you have a fix.
