Even if the toolchain were robust enough to be tested in CI, we would still want to use Rust's own toolchain as the primary means for SGX support. Thus, unless anyone has any strong objections, we will deprecate `rust-sgx-sdk` in favor of `x86_64-fortanix-unknown-sgx` as proposed in

If we require nodes to be implemented as `Node` subclasses, then they have to have C++ impls for inheritance to work. If we design a `Node` C API that doesn't have this requirement, then we can mix-and-match Node implementations between languages. That's really only useful for adding temporary node types for e.g. passes implemented in python though.
