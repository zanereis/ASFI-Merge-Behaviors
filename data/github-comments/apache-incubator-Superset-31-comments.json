to be sure, by \"database caravel uses internally\" i meant the database (if any) that caravel uses to manage users, roles, slices, dashboards etc... not my own stuff.\n\nI will spend to time to identify whatever services and files are left after the pip uninstall\nbut it would be a nice addition to the \"installation guide\"\n\nThank you for Caravel and your help

seeing a similar issue.  I was able to view the example dashboards previously when I had only one user (the admin set up through fabmanager).  Now I'm doing enough things off the beaten path that I'm not sure where I've gone wrong.\n\nI'm running caravel 0.10.0 with MySQL 5.6.27 (an AWS RDS) as my metadata store.  I created a custom security manager that is based on the REMOTE_USER strategy.  I'm running this in AWS ECS and one consequence of this is that I run `fabmanager create-admin`, `caravel db upgrade`, `caravel init`, and `caravel load_examples` on each deploy.  (This is likely a really bad idea and I need to figure out a way if initialization has already been done.)\n\nThe command `caravel db upgrade` results in an error message\n\n```\n_mysql_exceptions.OperationalError: (1060, \"Duplicate column name 'python_date_format'\")\n```\n\nI'm working on figuring out the ssh tunnels required to query the MySQL database.\n\nI don't see any error in the log files when I go to one of the example dashboards.  The error message \"Please define at least one metric for your table\" is in each of the charts on the dashboard, but nothing interesting is in the docker logs.\n\nBesides the repeated initialization, I'm likely skipping some necessary steps in my custom security manager.  I followed some of the examples from Flask-AppBuilder source, but this is my first experience working with FAB so I might be missing some basics.\n\nLet me know any additional information that would be helpful debugging this.\n\ncheers,\nDennis\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/243646944/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/243666019","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/1046#issuecomment-243666019","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/1046","id":243666019,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MzY2NjAxOQ==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-31T05:56:35Z","updated_at":"2016-08-31T05:56:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Awesome,
