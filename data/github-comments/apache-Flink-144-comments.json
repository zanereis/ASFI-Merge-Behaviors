is a good question @tonycox. First of all, we need to agree on the semantics of the `ProjectableTableSource.setProjection()` method. IMO, the table source must return a `DataSet` (or `DataStream`) with the fields in the order requested by `setProjection()`. If the `InputFormat` (or `SourceFunction`) is not able to control the order of fields, the table source needs to add a `MapFunction` to fix the order. This would happen in `BatchTableSource.getDataSet()` (or `StreamTableSource.getDataStream()` and hence be opaque to Calcite and not involve a `LogicalCalc`.\r\n\r\nFrom a performance point of view I agree with @wuchong that it would be good to have correct records produced by the `RowCsvInputFormat`. However, I would see this as a \"nice to have\" feature.

It's perfectly fine to do it as you describe. Not having the `currentExecution` set to the producer execution means that the producer was restarted (hence cancelled or failed).

I'll change that to only check the `currentExecution` and handle it accordingly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/264942793/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/264952630","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2810#issuecomment-264952630","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2810","id":264952630,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NDk1MjYzMA==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-05T19:33:16Z","updated_at":"2016-12-05T19:33:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @tonycox, the plan choice issues might be related to FLINK-5226.

I think we should work out a plan to merge our work together. \r\n\r\nA litter opinion here: I think it's pointless to let CsvTableSource be a ProjecableTableSource since it simply cannot avoid reading extra fields in the first place. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/265040265/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/265049885","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2653#issuecomment-265049885","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2653","id":265049885,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NTA0OTg4NQ==","user":{"login":"wuchong","id":5378924,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNzg5MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5378924?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong","html_url":"https://github.com/wuchong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-06T03:19:45Z","updated_at":"2016-12-06T03:19:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi @fhueske @twalthr ,  I have updated the PR, please review it again when you are available.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/265049885/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/265085363","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2810#issuecomment-265085363","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2810","id":265085363,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NTA4NTM2Mw==","user":{"login":"tonycox","id":15128562,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTI4NTYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15128562?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonycox","html_url":"https://github.com/tonycox","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonycox/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonycox/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonycox/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonycox/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonycox/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonycox/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonycox/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonycox/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonycox/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-06T08:01:16Z","updated_at":"2016-12-06T08:01:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @fhueske, your PR do solve my problem.

I'll have a look at both PRs and see how we can maybe split the effort into two commits. So, everybody gets a contribution out of this effort.\r\n\r\nRegarding making `CsvTableSource` a `ProjectableTableSource`, it is true that `CsvTableSource` will not benefit as much as other sources. Even with pushed-down projections, it will still read all data and split it into rows. However, we can save some time in field parsing (esp. tailing fields are not parsed at all) and object creation (and later garbage collection). So, making `CsvTableSource` a `ProjectableTableSource` will mainly safe some CPU time and not IO. In addition, this is currently the only `BatchTableSource` and rather easy to test.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/265105202/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/265106595","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2949#issuecomment-265106595","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2949","id":265106595,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NTEwNjU5NQ==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-06T09:50:02Z","updated_at":"2016-12-06T09:50:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"merging","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/265106595/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/265106732","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2943#issuecomment-265106732","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2943","id":265106732,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NTEwNjczMg==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-06T09:50:39Z","updated_at":"2016-12-06T09:50:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"merging","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/265106732/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/265106778","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2932#issuecomment-265106778","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2932","id":265106778,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NTEwNjc3OA==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-06T09:50:53Z","updated_at":"2016-12-06T09:50:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"merging","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/265106778/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/26510

Also we can't use `validateInputs` method there because field on the right side isn't resolved yet. But I think, there are ways to validate inputs.\r\n\r\nI've tried to solve this problem in more convinient way. It looks like implementation of IN for literals, but I've faced problems:\r\n- generating `RexNode` for IN qubquery. I've tried to use all possible variants, but logical plan for subquery was incorrect (had duplicated IN expression, for example). It's solvable, but needs changes in `Calcite`, I think.\r\n- implementation of `SubQueryVisitor` and `RelShuttle`. I didn't find ways to reuse existing code in this case. Also there isn't any existing examples which I was able to use as template.\r\n- it's not clear for me, how to use results of subquery in the operator (especially relationship between generated code).\r\n- generated logical plan differs from one generated in SQL query.\r\n\r\nAlso I thought about substitution of plan with inner join instead of plan with IN operator somewhere in code.

Let me first summarize what both of your PRs implement:\r\n\r\n@tonycox (PR #2810)\r\n- good test coverage with tests that check the optimized plan (`TableTestBase`)\r\n- adapted `RowCsvInputFormat` + `CsvTableSource` to support projection\r\n- first changes for projection pushdown in streaming\r\n- good cost function\r\n\r\n@beyond1920 (PR #2923)\r\n- Extracts fields from `RexProgram` and converts `RexProgram` (seems to reused in PR #2810)\r\n- Rules work on `DataSetRel` instead of `LogicalRel` (#2810 rules seem to be inspired by this rule)\r\n- too many ITCases\r\n- no changes for streaming\r\n- no projection support for `CsvTableSource`.\r\n\r\nFrom my point of view PR #2923 provides a solid basis for this feature which seem to be partially reused in PR #2810 but lacks a few things that have been implemented in PR #2810. \r\nTherefore, I would propose the following:\r\n\r\nPR #2923 is modified to cover the following:\r\n- `ProjectableTableSource`\r\n- `RexProgramProjectExtractor` + missing unit test\r\n- Rule to push projection into `BatchTableSourceScan`\r\n- Remove all ITCases except for one (the other PR will add more tests)\r\n- Adapt the cost model for the `BatchTableSourceScan` as in PR #2810.\r\n\r\nPR #2810 builds on PR#2923 and adds the following:\r\n- Translation for `StreamTableSourceScan` + one ITCase\r\n- `CsvTableSource` + `RowCsvInputFormat` changes (including tests and tests refactoring)\r\n- The extensive plan tests based on `TableTestBase` for batch and streaming\r\n\r\nIf we agree on this plan, it would be good if PR #2923 would be adapted as soon as possible such that PR #2810 can be built on top.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think @tonycox, @beyond1920, @KurtYoung?\r\n\r\nBest,

This PR won't change that behaviour. It only affects non-HA behaviour.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the behaviour is to remove checkpoints on suspension, which is definitely a problem. But in non-HA mode suspension happens also for graceful shut down (for example when terminating a YARN session). Never deleting on suspend means that users who have `DELETE_ON_CANCELLATION` configured, will have externalized checkpoints lingering around when they shut down their non-HA cluster. That's why I thought it might be better to treat this the same as the retain/delete on cancellation configuration.\r\n\r\nDoes this make sense?

The problem is the following:\r\n\r\nA `TableSource` provides schema information for the Table it produces. However, the methods `TableSource.getFieldNames()` and `TableSouce.getFieldTypes()` return flat arrays which are interpreted as flat schema (the second field in the array represents the second table attribute) without any nesting.\r\n\r\nAvro and many other storage formats (JSON, Parquet, ...) support nested data structures. With the current limitation of the `TableSource` interface, we would need to convert the nested data into a flat schema. However, the Table API and SQL support processing of nested data and it would be a much better integration to pass Avro objects in their original structure into the Table API / SQL query (see my updated proposal for [FLINK-3871](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-3871). \r\n\r\nIn order to be able to create a Table of nested Avro data, we need to improve the `TableSource` interface first. Once this is done, we can continue with this PR.\r\n\r\nI'm very sorry, that I did not think about this earlier and the effort you already put into this issue.\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions. \r\nBest, Fabian","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/265678984/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/265684536","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2926#issuecomment-265684536","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2926","id":265684536,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NTY4NDUzNg==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-08T08:41:25Z","updated_at":"2016-12-08T08:41:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks
