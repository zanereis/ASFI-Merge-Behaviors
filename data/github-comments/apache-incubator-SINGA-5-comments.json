It should be better to return a Tensor instance. To keep it compatible, we can add a new function, sum_at() (returns a tensor), and mark the original sum() as deprecated. When we release v3.0, we mark sum_at as deprecated and change the sum() to return a tensor. This is to follow the convention of the X.Y.Z version style.\r\n> 2. Is it more common to pass axis as an integer than an array? Do we need to do summation along multiple dimensions?\r\n\r\nHi @nudles , regarding 1:\r\ncurrently in Dev:\r\n```\r\nTensor SumAll(const Tensor &in);\r\nTensor Sum(const Tensor &in, const int axis);\r\nSType Sum(const Tensor &in);\r\n```\r\ndo you mean we should change to:\r\n```\r\nV2.x.x\r\nTensor SumAll(const Tensor &in);\r\nDeprecated{Tensor Sum(const Tensor &in, const int axis);}\r\nSType Sum(const Tensor &in);\r\nTesnor SumAt(const Tensor &in, const int axis);\r\n```\r\nand at V3.0\r\n```\r\nV3.0\r\nTensor SumAll(const Tensor &in);\r\nTensor Sum(const Tensor &in, const int axis);\r\nTensor Sum(const Tensor &in);\r\nDeprecated{Tesnor SumAt(const Tensor &in, const int axis);}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs mentioned by Chris, SumAll is already merged, and everything should work now... My comment was not aware of that.\r\n\r\nMaybe we could just change `SType Sum()` to `SType SumValue()`.\r\n\r\nRegarding 2. passing axis as array is just an API supported by both numpy,
