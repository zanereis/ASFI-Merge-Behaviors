for the review @twalthr.\r\nI've updated the PR. \r\n\r\n@haohui: This PR preserves the current logic that time attributes are exposed as `TIMESTAMP`. I agree that support for time indicators that expose themselves as `Long` is desirable. However, this requires quite a few changes as we need to extend several functions (incl. `TUMBLE`, `HOP`, etc.) and validation logic in some operators (over windows, joins, etc.). So this is not a lightweight change and should be done as a separate issue, IMO.

have one more talking point for this: the behaviour of the iterators for RocksDB and heap backends became different now explicitly by a change request on the PR : for RocksDB we iterate over a snapshot of the data and modifications concurrently (by that, I mean not in a different thread, but just interleaved with the iteration in the same thread) to the iteration will work and not be reflected in the iterator. In the heap backend, the concurrent modifications will make the iterator fail.

While a job is running you ask \"/jobs/running/:jobid\", until you get a 404 and then check \"/jobs/completed/:jobid\".\r\n* Submitting a job is a POST to \"/jobs\", which returns \"/jobs/running/:jobid\" which may return a 404 if the job fails straight away.\r\n* A unified URL allows us to actually provide good error messages, i.e. a 405 Method not Allowed when trying to take a savepoint for finished jobs. For separate URLs this would return a 404.\r\n* We have to handle the case of a savepoint/stop request arriving for the finished job anyway, if the job finishes between accepting the request and handling it.\r\n* Taking a savepoint would be a POST to \"/jobs/running/:jobid/savepoints\", and would thus have to return \"/jobs/running/:jobid/savepoints/:savepointid\". If the job is completed these suddenly disappear and now reside under \"/jobs/completed/:jobid/savepoints/:savepointid\".\r\n\r\nGiven that it only affects taking savepoints and stopping a job i don't think it's really necessary to change things.

This calls `comparator.compareSerialized`, which is currently implemented for most types by simply deserializing the records and then comparing the deserialized form. It would maybe bring some performance improvement if this had a real implementation, which would deserialize only the key fields (which are relevant to the comparison). The hard part here is how to handle nullable fields, which make the offset of individual fields unpredictable.\r\n\r\nSo I think a simpler and better approach is to just make sure that most types have a good implementation of `putNormalizedKey`, and then `NormalizedKeySorter.compareRecords` would be called only rarely, so its performance wouldn't really matter.\r\n\r\n> We are working on a project to fully code generate the algorithm Flink runtime used, and borrowed lots of idea of this PR, thanks!\r\n\r\nI'm happy to hear that!\r\n\r\nBtw. I think a large potential in code-generation is to eliminate the overheads of the very many virtual function calls throughout the runtime, by making the calls monomorphic [1,2]. For example, there could be a custom `MapDriver` generated for each map UDF, and then this custom class would always call the same UDF, making the call monomorphic, and thus easily optimizable by the JVM [1,2]. (I think @greghogan was also thinking about this.)\r\n\r\nFor example, the following virtual calls are on the per-record code path:\r\n- drivers (such as `MapDriver`) calling `MutableObjectIterator.next`\r\n- drivers calling the UDF\r\n- drivers calling `output.collect`\r\n- `ReusingDeserializationDelegate` or `NonReusingDeserializationDelegate` calling `serializer.deserialize`\r\n- `SpillingResettableMutableObjectIterator` calling `serializer.serialize` and `serializer.deserialize`\r\n- `PojoSerializer`, `TupleSerializer`, `RowSerializer`, etc. calling their field serializers\r\n- `CountingCollector` calling `collector.collect`\r\n- `RecordWriter` calling `channelSelector.selectChannels`\r\n- `SerializationDelegate` calling `serializer.serialize`\r\n- `StreamElementSerializer` calling methods on its `typeSerializer`\r\n- `OutputEmitter` calling `comparator.hash`\r\n- `ComparableKeySelector` calling `comparator.extractKeys`\r\n- `assignToKeyGroup` calling `key.hashCode`\r\n\r\nI think most of the above calls are megamorphic (especially in larger Flink jobs with many operators), which makes them slow [1,2]. They could be made monomorphic by code-generating custom versions of these classes, where the customization would be to fix the type of the targets of these calls. (I think this could probably be done independently of the Table API.)\r\n\r\nAnother potential for code-generation is customizing `OutputEmitter` for the number of channels: there are places where a modulo operation is performed, which is much faster if the divisor is a compile-time constant, since then the compiler uses such tricks as described in this paper:\r\nhttps://gmplib.org/~tege/divcnst-pldi94.pdf\r\nAnd the same optimization could be made in `KeyGroupRangeAssignment`, where there are divisions by `maxParallelism`.\r\n\r\n> we need more type information control and flexible code generating supports, so we choose to do it through the Table API & SQL. How do you see this approach?\r\n\r\nHaving more info about the types, UDFs, etc. of your program certainly can help. Unfortunately I don't know too much about the Table API & SQL, but I have a few random thoughts:\r\n- Since you are generating the UDFs, it should be possible to make them have good object reuse behavior, without the users having to worry about the non-trivial object reuse rules.\r\n- For basic types (int, boolean, etc.) the generated code could use `IntValue`, `BooleanValue`, etc., facilitating more object reuse, again without making the users write ugly boilerplate (as they have to do in the DataSet/DataStream API when they want to use these classes).\r\n- Same thing with `StringValue`\r\n\r\nBtw. have you seen this PR for code generation for POJO serializers and comparators? https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2211\r\nIt has some issues, so it is not as close to merging as this PR, but maybe I'll try to tie that up as well some time.\r\n\r\n[1] http://insightfullogic.com/2014/May/12/fast-and-megamorphic-what-influences-method-invoca/\r\n[2] https://shipilev.net/blog/2015/black-magic-method-dispatch/","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/333152895/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/333181364","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4509#issuecomment-333181364","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4509","id":333181364,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMzE4MTM2NA==","user":{"login":"zhijiangW","id":12387855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzg3ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12387855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW","html_url":"https://github.com/zhijiangW","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-29T17:00:17Z","updated_at":"2017-09-29T17:00:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@NicoK , thanks for reviews and talking about this key point.\r\n\r\nI think I understand your point and agree with that.

But i agree that code generation can't help with this situation, so we investigate some binary data formats to represent our record and modify the interface of TypeSerializer & TypeComparator when doing ser/de. We don't have to consume the input/output view byte by byte, but has the ability to random access the underlying data, aka MemorySegment. It acts like spark's UnsafeRow: https://reviewable.io/reviews/apache/spark/5725, so we can eliminate the most deserialization cost such as `read byte[]` and then `new String(byte[])`.  We combine this approach with some code generation to eliminate the virtual function call of the TypeComparator and see a 10x performance improvements with sorting on strings. \r\n\r\n> I think a large potential in code-generation is to eliminate the overheads of the very many virtual function calls throughout the runtime\r\n\r\nTotally agreed, after we finish dealing with the code generation and improving the ser/de, we will investigate more about this. Good to see that you have a list of all the megamorphic calls. BTW, we are actually translating the batch jobs into the streaming runtime, i think there will be lots in common. \r\n\r\nHaving and control more type informations, and code generation the whole operator have lots of benefits, it can also help to making most of the calls monomorphic, such as:\r\n- fully control of the object reusing, yes\r\n- comparators\r\n- generating hash codes\r\n- potential improvements of some algorithm which finds out they only need to deal with fixed length data\r\n- Directly using primitive variables when dealing with simple type\r\n\r\nAnd you are right this is orthogonal with runtime improvements, and we see the boundary is the Operator. The framework should provide the most efficient environment for operators to run, and we will code generating the most efficient operators to live in it. \r\n\r\n> Btw. have you seen this PR for code generation for POJO serializers and comparators? #2211\r\n\r\nI didn't see it yet, will find some time to check it out.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/333272341/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
