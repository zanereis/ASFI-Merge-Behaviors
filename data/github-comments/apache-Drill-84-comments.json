Spark allocates a set of workers per job. Spark starts workers for each job, based on the estimated complexity of the job. By contrast, Drill uses a shared cluster: queries run using the workers available at the moment the query runs. Spark is designed for large, complex, long-running jobs. Drill is designed for many concurrent short-running queries. In Drill, the query would normally be done long before new nodes get organized and join the cluster.\r\n\r\nBack in the day, Drill provided Drill-on-YARN to manage a Drill cluster in Hadoop. Scaling was manual, though an API encouraged someone to design a controller that would observe load and scale the cluster up or down to track average load. In modern times, K8s is the preferred alternative. The Drill operator handles the mechanics of scale-up or -down. Again, a separate controller would be needed to adjust cluster size based on load trends and/or local policies. [Feedback Control for Computer Systems](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/feedback-control-for/9781449362638/) explains the the kind of PID controller that could do the job.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/1667274517/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/1667349812","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/issues/2817#issuecomment-1667349812","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2817","id":1667349812,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAFa5xc5jYb00","user":{"login":"LYCJeff","id":116775163,"node_id":"U_kgDOBvXY-w","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116775163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LYCJeff","html_url":"https://github.com/LYCJeff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LYCJeff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LYCJeff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LYCJeff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LYCJeff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LYCJeff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LYCJeff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LYCJeff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LYCJeff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LYCJeff/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-07T07:38:51Z","updated_at":"2023-08-07T07:38:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jnturton @paul-rogers Thanks for reply.\r\n\r\nIn my case, queries are irregular, with a high of a few hundred concurrent and a low of completely idle. I was wondering if Drill could run serverless or elastic on the idle resources of the cluster, rather than taking up a lot of resources up front.

I'll paste a chat message I sent to @vvysotskyi a few months back below, to reveal the nature of the problem. I'm sure it's ultimately fixable, but I don't know of an elegant fix yet.\r\n\r\n> Hi Vova! I decided to try upgrading Drill's Hadoop libs to 3.3.5. Things are working but there is a problem in the Drill JDBC fat jar. There, the shade plugin relocates Hadoop to underneath oadd as usual but now there are class names present in the core-default.xml file in hadoop-common.jar which are not updated by the shade plugin. The result is that the JDBC driver is broken. While the shade plugin can update some kinds of text config files, it doesn't appear that it can update arbitrary XML config like core-default.xml. I thought of including our own manually updated copy of core-default.xml in exec/jdbc-all/src/resources and trying to make sure the shade plugin picks that one instead of the one in hadoop-common.jar. My only reservation is that introducing this copy creates a maintenance burden for the future so I thought to ask you if you have any ideas...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/1682344122/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/1684011222","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2819#issuecomment-1684011222","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2819","id":1684011222,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAFa5xc5kX_jW","user":{"login":"cgivre","id":5513150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTMxNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5513150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre","html_url":"https://github.com/cgivre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-18T14:34:09Z","updated_at":"2023-08-18T14:34:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mbeckerle Could you please take another look.

too.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/1849019362/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/1849470023","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/issues/2851#issuecomment-1849470023","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2851","id":1849470023,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAFa5xc5uPKxH","user":{"login":"shfshihuafeng","id":25974968,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTc0OTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25974968?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shfshihuafeng","html_url":"https://github.com/shfshihuafeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shfshihuafeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shfshihuafeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shfshihuafeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shfshihuafeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shfshihuafeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shfshihuafeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shfshihuafeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shfshihuafeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shfshihuafeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-11T07:31:35Z","updated_at":"2023-12-11T07:31:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@cgivre
