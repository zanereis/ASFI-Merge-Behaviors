It's already active. Checkout:\nhttps://flask-appbuilder.readthedocs.org/en/latest/quickhowto.html#rest-api\n\nEach ORM model has its own api endpoint. So assuming your model list view is at `http://localhost:8088/slicemodelview/list/`, your api description endpoint is at `http://localhost:8088/slicemodelview/api`.
