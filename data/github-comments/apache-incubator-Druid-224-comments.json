And I had tried the QoS filter, it's not a good solution if there are thousands of `SegmentAllocateAction`, because it would also cause many retries, requests exceeded the `maxRequests` would be rejected and the tasks would retry until success. It's hard to determine the value  of `maxRequests` and things would be worse if there are many tries.\r\n\r\nFinally, I solved this problem by using a more granular lock, i.e using the `doInSyncDataSourceAndInterval` method, then deployed the overlord in a machine with enough resources (CPU 24 cores, Memory 48GB).

I'm still looking at, but have a question for the general design.\r\n> \r\n> Why do we need a new query type for moving average? Rather, can we generalize `Averager` and `PostAverager` to support any types of queries like `PostAggregator`? This question is related to `MovingAverageQueryRunner`. It internally generates a query and computes moving average on top of it. I don't think this is necessary, but we can generalize this logic similar to `PostAggregator`.\r\n\r\nI completely agree the work could be incorporated within the general Query. The reason it was created as a separate query type is for the sake of easier implementation (due to the separation of concerns). Calling the underlying query through an internal API is easier than making those changes directly to `Queries` or another class. Perhaps refactoring it into the core query framework could be a future work?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/466632938/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/466633093","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/6430#issuecomment-466633093","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6430","id":466633093,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NjYzMzA5Mw==","user":{"login":"yurmix","id":1529282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjkyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurmix","html_url":"https://github.com/yurmix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurmix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurmix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurmix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurmix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurmix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurmix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurmix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurmix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurmix/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-23T09:31:53Z","updated_at":"2019-02-23T09:31:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jihoonson BTW, I have a couple of my own design concerns and I welcome your thoughts on the matter:\r\n1.

The reason it was created as a separate query type is for the sake of easier implementation (due to the separation of concerns). Calling the underlying query through an internal API is easier than making those changes directly to `Queries` or another class. Perhaps refactoring it into the core query framework could be a future work?\r\n\r\n@yurmix I see. It makes sense to me.\r\n\r\n> 1. The complexity of `MovingAverageIterable`. But I would be careful in changing that for the sake of refactoring.\r\n\r\nIt looks complex, but I think it would be easier to understand if you can add more comments. But, simpler implementation would be great if possible. Would you tell me a bit of details of what kind of refactoring you think?\r\n\r\n> 2. `Averager` implements their own accumulation formulas (computeResults) which are separate from the formulas of `Aggregator`. I think this could be refactored in order to easily add more types of Averagers and perhaps in order to allign null-handling with the new standards.\r\n\r\nIt sounds good, but I'm wondering we can use our `Aggregator` for moving average instead of adding a new type of Averager. It would be best if we can because we don't have to implement almost same aggregation logic again (ex, `DoubleMaxAverager` and `DoubleMaxAggregator`). Probably possible if we can integrate `Accumulator` with `Aggregator`. Or, maybe it's even easier if we can use `Grouper` (like `StreamingMergeSortedGrouper`, but simpler non-thread-safe one).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/467147621/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/467148129","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/6874#issuecomment-467148129","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6874","id":467148129,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NzE0ODEyOQ==","user":{"login":"maver1ck","id":4006010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMDYwMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4006010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maver1ck","html_url":"https://github.com/maver1ck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maver1ck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maver1ck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maver1ck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maver1ck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maver1ck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maver1ck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maver1ck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maver1ck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maver1ck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-25T19:27:54Z","updated_at":"2019-02-25T19:27:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think it is right now\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/tree/master/distribution/docker","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/467148129/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/467161058","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/2479#issuecomment-467161058","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2479","id":467161058,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NzE2MTA1OA==","user":{"login":"josh-pritchard-fcx","id":45771941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NzcxOTQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45771941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/josh-pritchard-fcx","html_url":"https://github.com/josh-pritchard-fcx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josh-pritchard-fcx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josh-pritchard-fcx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josh-pritchard-fcx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josh-pritchard-fcx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josh-pritchard-fcx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josh-pritchard-fcx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josh-pritchard-fcx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josh-pritchard-fcx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josh-pritchard-fcx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-25T20:00:46Z","updated_at":"2019-02-25T20:00:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@gianm This is still an issue any chance this might work its way into a release?
