@tristaZero \r\n\r\nThanks a lot for taking your time and clarifying.\r\n\r\nActually the application I am working on is more complex where the sharding column will not be present in SQL and we use separate lookup table to identify the shard based on metadata. \r\n\r\nSo we can only use hint strategy and not inline or standard. Using the metadata in the request we will use a lookup table to find the shard and set it in hintmanager.\r\n\r\nWe have more than 20 shards, and by some programming error if shard is not set in hintmanager before some query is run then all the 20 shards will be queried, which will be not advisable.\r\n\r\nSo wanted to know if there is any setting to control this behaviour\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/675260350/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/675265557","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/pull/6819#issuecomment-675265557","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/6819","id":675265557,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3NTI2NTU1Nw==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-18T05:45:25Z","updated_at":"2020-08-19T10:40:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## Pull Request Test Coverage Report for [Build 13907](https://coveralls.io/builds/32855619)\n\n* **0** of **0**   changed or added relevant lines in **0** files are covered.\n* **148** unchanged lines in **5** files lost coverage.\n* Overall coverage decreased (**-0.07%**) to **60.217%**\n\n---\n\n\n|  Files with Coverage Reduction | New Missed Lines | % |\n| :-----|--------------|--: |\n| [shardingsphere-kernel/shardingsphere-kernel-context/src/main/java/org/apache/shardingsphere/kernel/context/SchemaContext.java](https://coveralls.io/builds/32855619/source?filename=shardingsphere-kernel%2Fshardingsphere-kernel-context%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Forg%2Fapache%2Fshardingsphere%2Fkernel%2Fcontext%2FSchemaContext.java#L48) | 1 | 0% |\n| [shardingsphere-sql-parser/shardingsphere-sql-parser-binder/src/main/java/org/apache/shardingsphere/sql/parser/binder/statement/dml/SelectStatementContext.java](https://coveralls.io/builds/32855619/source?filename=shardingsphere-sql-parser%2Fshardingsphere-sql-parser-binder%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Forg%2Fapache%2Fshardingsphere%2Fsql%2Fparser%2Fbinder%2Fstatement%2Fdml%2FSelectStatementContext.java#L99) | 7 | 89.39% |\n| [shardingsphere-proxy/shardingsphere-proxy-backend/src/main/java/org/apache/shardingsphere/proxy/backend/text/query/QueryBackendHandler.java](https://coveralls.io/builds/32855619/source?filename=shardingsphere-proxy%2Fshardingsphere-proxy-backend%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Forg%2Fapache%2Fshardingsphere%2Fproxy%2Fbackend%2Ftext%2Fquery%2FQueryBackendHandler.java#L57) | 8 | 0% |\n| [shardingsphere-proxy/shardingsphere-proxy-backend/src/main/java/org/apache/shardingsphere/proxy/backend/text/TextProtocolBackendHandlerFactory.java](https://coveralls.io/builds/32855619/source?filename=shardingsphere-proxy%2Fshardingsphere-proxy-backend%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Forg%2Fapache%2Fshardingsphere%2Fproxy%2Fbackend%2Ftext%2FTextProtocolBackendHandlerFactory.java#L77) | 8 | 75.76% |\n| [shardingsphere-sql-parser/shardingsphere-sql-parser-dialect/shardingsphere-sql-parser-mysql/src/main/java/org/apache/shardingsphere/sql/parser/mysql/visitor/MySQLVisitor.java](https://coveralls.io/builds/32855619/source?filename=shardingsphere-sql-parser%2Fshardingsphere-sql-parser-dialect%2Fshardingsphere-sql-parser-mysql%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Forg%2Fapache%2Fshardingsphere%2Fsql%2Fparser%2Fmysql%2Fvisitor%2FMySQLVisitor.java#L119) | 124 | 0% |\n<!-- | **Total:** | **148** |  | -->\n\n|  Totals | [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/builds/32855619/badge)](https://coveralls.io/builds/32855619) |\n| :-- | --: |\n| Change from base [Build 13876](https://coveralls.io/builds/32825979): |  -0.07% |\n| Covered Lines: | 13715 |\n| Relevant Lines: | 22776 |\n\n---\n##### 💛  -

I update a entity ,the logic sql look like this\r\n`update order_item set app_id=?, create_date=?, order_info=?, orderno=?, original_price=?, pay_date=?, pay_source=?, price=?, product_list=?, source_orderno=?, status=?, user_id=? where id=?`\r\nIt canbe understand that sql will execute in all table shard, I set other field as the key to sharding table,not the id.\r\nBut update sql is special,it can be shard by the updated field,sharding field value is expectd not be change.Of course if not set the shard field the sharding function not work.(which I called table select function).\r\n\r\nNow, when I execute update, I got the following result.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33279488/90583752-91f8c380-e203-11ea-9a9c-a9fee2f885da.png)\r\nUpdate sql almost like insert sql , but insert can work within expewctations, why not the update.\r\n\r\n`if (sqlStatement instanceof InsertStatement) {\r\n            return new

I want avoid all routing when the sql is `update **** where id=*`.\r\nthis sql can contain `sharding key` like `update * set shardingkey=* * where id=*`.\r\nI think it canbe down so I open the

Hi You mean the SQL below runs well for MySQL but badly for ShardingProxy?\r\n\r\n> SELECT USER, HOST FROM PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA.accounts WHERE (( USER, HOST ) IN (( 'root', 'localhost' ),( '', '' )));\r\n\r\nHow about the following one? @jingshanglu Do you think it can work fine in our `master branch`?\r\n> SELECT USER, HOST FROM PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA.accounts WHERE ( USER, HOST ) IN (( 'root', 'localhost' ),( '', '' ));\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/676908056/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/676910313","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/6939#issuecomment-676910313","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/6939","id":676910313,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3NjkxMDMxMw==","user":{"login":"tristaZero","id":27757146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NzU3MTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27757146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero","html_url":"https://github.com/tristaZero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-20T03:07:32Z","updated_at":"2020-08-20T03:07:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@strongduanmu
