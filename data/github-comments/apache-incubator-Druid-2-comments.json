original reasoning for the order of the operations is that we load everything first before starting Jetty and publishing our existence to ZK because we don't want the master to start assigning segments until we load all of our local stuff.\n\nI can see two general solutions for this.  \n\n1) On our machines, the majority of this time is actually spent updating zookeeper one znode at a time.  I'd like to adjust our ZK interactions for publishing segments to actually batch up segments so that there would be more than one segment per znode.  This would decrease the total round trip time when loading off of the local disk and hopefully speed things up.\n\n2) We could add a configuration switch that tells it to not wait for all the segments to load before starting the main jetty process.  This shouldn't cause any concurrency problems with the Master assigning things, it will just likely cause a little bit of churn in segments loading and unloading.\n\n(1) is something I'd like to do anyway, but it requires a bit of thought around how to do it in a backwards compatible manner.  It seems like (2) could be relatively simple and provide immediate relief though.\n\nIs it a big enough deal to do (2) before (1) can be completed, or can you wait for (1) (O(months) probably, if we are implementing it)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/18456880/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/18629915","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/154#issuecomment-18629915","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/154","id":18629915,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4NjI5OTE1","user":{"login":"sixtus","id":91857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxODU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sixtus","html_url":"https://github.com/sixtus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sixtus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sixtus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sixtus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sixtus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sixtus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sixtus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sixtus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sixtus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sixtus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-05-29T16:44:48Z","updated_at":"2013-05-29T16:44:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It can wait, it was just Fangjin being very surprised and asking for a ticket.

Thinking it through, the simplest form of this thing could just be something that checks the InputStream for data on a hasMore() call and does stuff so that getNext() will return the right value.  That is difficult to test, however, so we should have a little bit more abstraction in place to simplify testing.\n\nThat said, the abstractions in place right now do not seem to simplify testing.  I think one of the things that makes the tests weird is that the Queue is the shared object, rather than some other abstraction that we have more control over.

First of all, thanks for taking the time to improve the RabbitMQ implementation.\n\nI just did a quick smoke test on this and mainly I'm wondering about how this has been tested and in which cases it works? I did a brute force shutdown of the rabbitmq server and then started it back up to see if it would reconnect. It didn't since the code doesn't have an \"incremental delay reconnection strategy\", that is, once a connection is lost it tries to reconnect immediately and if that fails it just gives up.\n\nAlso, unless I'm misunderstanding something, there seems to be some weirdness with the reconnection code:\n\n```\n    //connection  restart\n   if (connection.isOpen()) {\n      try {\n          connection = connectionFactory.newConnection();\n          channel.basicRecover();\n```\n\nIs that supposed to be if (connection.isOpen())? That seems weird to me.\n\nSo I would like to hear a little bit more about what testing has been done and for what scenarios this actually does re-establish a connection to the MQ.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/22295455/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/22307673","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/211#issuecomment-22307673","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/211","id":22307673,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMzA3Njcz","user":{"login":"gcmalloc","id":184983,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDk4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184983?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcmalloc","html_url":"https://github.com/gcmalloc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcmalloc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcmalloc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcmalloc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcmalloc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcmalloc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcmalloc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcmalloc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcmalloc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcmalloc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-08-08T07:41:08Z","updated_at":"2013-08-08T07:41:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I only test it with a intermittent channel.

When I feel like we have the docs in a position that they can be used to create an extension module, I'll let you know by commenting on this issue.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/24849266/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/25190825","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/248#issuecomment-25190825","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/248","id":25190825,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MTkwODI1","user":{"login":"cheddar","id":216778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjc3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/216778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar","html_url":"https://github.com/cheddar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-09-26T18:20:25Z","updated_at":"2013-09-26T18:20:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Have we tested this by running a job on a cluster somewhere?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/25190825/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/25923536","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/259#issuecomment-25923536","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/259","id":25923536,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1OTIzNTM2","user":{"login":"rjurney","id":42149,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42149?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjurney","html_url":"https://github.com/rjurney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjurney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjurney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjurney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjurney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjurney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjurney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjurney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjurney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjurney/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-10-08T20:15:19Z","updated_at":"2013-10-08T20:15:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Using a different example than wikipedia.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/25923536/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
