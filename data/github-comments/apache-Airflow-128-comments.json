I would prefer a high level design before doing this as it is quite core. Couple of things that should be present:\r\n\r\n1) Poll vs Push: Dags should only be fetched if a newer one is present; What will we use for identification?\r\n2) Storage location: as we now should have a place where dags should be pulled towards to lets make sure we start using the LSB location for this: /var/lib/airflow/dags is probably best\r\n3) Security: Is any worker allowed to pull any dag? I think a proper security model needs to be in place\r\n4) API integration: Can we also PUSH dags to the remote location?\r\n\r\nObviously, not everything needs to be in place right away, but having an generic idea where we are moving towards to seems smart.

Updated the PR:\r\n- Renamed base class to BaseDagFetcher\r\n- Separated each fetcher into modules in airflow.dag.fetchers\r\n- get_dag_fetchers defined in __init__.py\r\n- Added dag_fetchers to plugins_manager.py, the facilities to integrate those plugins, tests etc..\r\n\r\nOther topics:\r\n- @jgao54's suggestion of adding a default config for the fetcher to use makes sense to me, so as not to tie a service/scheme to only one fetcher. Maybe we don't look at the URI prefix of the dags_folder setting at all?\r\n- @bolkedebruin's second point hints at the possibility of always fetching dags to _/var/lib/airflow/dags_. I like the idea of forcing this, because implementing a DagFetcher would only be a matter of downloading the files, and all the logic that this PR has currently in FileSystemDagFetcher could be moved to the base class. For example the method fetch of FileSystemDagFetcher would just be the logic to copy from <settings.dags_folder> to _/var/lib/airflow/dags_.\r\n- Regarding a proper security model, I'd be happy to hear suggestions.\r\n\r\nI felt like starting the implementation would help to get things moving, but I'm happy to create a design doc.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/374440242/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/374508812","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3127#issuecomment-374508812","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3127","id":374508812,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NDUwODgxMg==","user":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-20T08:06:26Z","updated_at":"2018-03-20T08:06:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@sekikn Oops, I missed that.

If such library exist, maybe we can just have a single `RemoteDagFetcher` class to handle many of the storage backends. The git one is slightly different perhaps and should have support for a git ref in there like a some SHA `git://repolocation/{SOME_GIT_REF_WHICH_COULD_BE_MASTER_OR_SOME_SHA}/myfolder/mydag.py`\r\n* serialization: there's support for `.zip` files now somehow, and I can see how it would be nice to have this extensible. Proper modeling would call for yet another abstraction for that, though my thought is that the base dag fetcher class can handle it in a method. We'll need some support for fetch, decompress in temp, keep-as-cached, cleanup flow.\r\n* versioning: there has to be versioning semantics in the API here\r\n* dags manifest: currently the DAGs list is inferred by crawling through the DAGS_FOLDER (yuck! my bad...), we need alternate ways of defining that. Providing a list of URIs would be a reasonable alternative. Perhaps there's a way to generate that list of URIs given a DAGS_FOLDER. `airflow_settings` could have a `DAG_LIST` configuration that defaults to the current DAG_LIST = `lambda x: DagBag.crawl_folder_for_dags(conf.get('DAGS_FOLDER'))`. has to have support for a callable as it may change over time, the scheduler should know when to re-evaluate the callable periodically. We'd probably expect people to move towards maintaining a list manually.\r\n* assuming version semantics in URIs, perhaps pinning the URI in the DagRun instance. This would allow for version consistency within a DagRun\r\n\r\nI think the URI is really key here. Assuming that the URI contains a provenance (s3, hive, hdfs, git), and can contain a version number (people are free to version their artifacts, create symlinks to latests, git refs, ...) and that an extension `.zip`, `.tar.gz` can call for some unpacking handling.\r\n\r\nA few more thing:\r\n* caching: hopefully we don't fetch-unpack-interpret when we don't need to, has to be deterministic somehow for different processes on the same box to reuse it. Not sure if caching logic should live (DagBag? DagFetcher?)\r\n* would be great to move towards a more stateless web server, I'm not sure where that fits in, it's probably not a great idea to handle the DAG fetching within the web request's scope\r\n\r\nSorry for the large brain dump here.

I was just scared after we triggered unexpected code that was in module scope  (no `if __name__ == __main__` section...) somewhere in DAGS_FOLDER.\r\n\r\nAbout the DAGS_MANIFEST idea, if it can receive a callable, people can do whatever they want to manage their dictionary of dag_ids -> URIs.  If they want a hard coded list that's fine, if they want to parse a yaml file they can do that, use the current crawler logic equivalent it'sok, if they want to put it in a `models.Variable` (yuck) that works too :)\r\n\r\nIn retrospec the `DagBag` being a dynamic thing parsing through a folder has drawback and I'd rather move to enforce something more explicit. Turns out parsing a folder full of python code to find objects of a certain type is a bad idea. Something as simple as `sys.exit()` or `time.sleep(10**10)`  in any module could create major problems (though I think we've built up quite a immune system around those at this point)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/375184858/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/375195203","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3137#issuecomment-375195203","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3137","id":375195203,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NTE5NTIwMw==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-22T06:38:25Z","updated_at":"2018-03-22T06:41:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Added target fix version 1.9.1 to the Jira as it's a bug / unexpected behavior.

With so much on the table, I'm thinking that it makes sense to explicitly divide this into phases. The base re-architecture seems like the low hanging fruit we could merge first, allowing independent development of many of these features afterwards. Something like:\r\n\r\n### Base re-arch:\r\n- Dag Fetcher abstraction with `BaseDagFetcher`\r\n- Storage location definition (Max called it caching).\r\n- Backwards compatible `FileSystemDagFetcher` with its fetching logic from _dags_folder_ to the cache.\r\n- Dispatching base on URI scheme prefix\r\n\r\nIt seems like the above could be done in such a way where things would be strictly improved, even before further work.\r\n\r\n### Independent features:\r\n- Dag Fetchers for all the things\r\n- Proper unpacking based on suffix (separate `.zip` logic as well as new `.tar.gz`)\r\n- Version semantics\r\n- Security model for dag fetching\r\n- `SETTINGS.DAG_FETCHER`, to support multiple DagFetchers for the same URI scheme\r\n- `SETTINGS.DAG_LIST` callable, to support explicit manifest of which dags to fetch\r\n- Tackle version consistency within a DagRun instance\r\n- Webserver performance when fetching remotely\r\n\r\nHow should we go about starting the design doc? The Airflow space in Confluence seems like the right place, but I don't have permission to create a new page.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/375494575/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/375501512","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2330#issuecomment-375501512","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2330","id":375501512,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NTUwMTUxMg==","user":{"login":"sekikn","id":898388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/898388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn","html_url":"https://github.com/sekikn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-23T00:32:46Z","updated_at":"2018-03-23T00:32:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@artwr

Note that FAB is shipping much of the CRUD REST API out of the box and will apply the same RBAC as the UI. When we add per-DAG access to the CRUD, it will apply to the REST API the same way. Getting this CRUD UI is neat.\r\n\r\nNow CRUD is only a small portion of the needed REST API, other portion include the CLI-supporting endpoints, and cross communication endpoints (heartbeats and such).\r\n\r\nThere's the question of whether to bring in the private REST API into or under the realm of FAB, or to bring in some of FAB's access controls into the private REST API. I could be convinced either way, I'd probably vouch towards consolidating for the sake having less moving parts, though the auth-related reqs are different for users and machines most of the time, and we'd have to make FAB support multi-auths in some cases. For Superset at Lyft for instance where we have such requirements (auth for user is different than auth for machines), we've hacked in support for both header-driver auth for machines along with oauth for users (in FAB).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/375710245/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/375749510","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3151#issuecomment-375749510","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3151","id":375749510,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NTc0OTUxMA==","user":{"login":"johnarnold","id":1329084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjkwODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1329084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnarnold","html_url":"https://github.com/johnarnold","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnarnold/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnarnold/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnarnold/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnarnold/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnarnold/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnarnold/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnarnold/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnarnold/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnarnold/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-23T17:52:38Z","updated_at":"2018-03-23T17:52:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"rebased
