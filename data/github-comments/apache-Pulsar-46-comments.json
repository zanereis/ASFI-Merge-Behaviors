I have seen a general problem with your PR is combining multiple things together. If this PR has broken into two pieces, one is removing arquilian dependency and modules, the other one is consolidating modules. the first piece could have been done. \r\n\r\nAs a general advice for future PRs, I would recommend splitting any larger PR into smaller ones. that's easier to get things done and move forward faster. Otherwise a larger PR will end up in WIP for weeks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/406718933/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/406719222","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/2209#issuecomment-406719222","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/2209","id":406719222,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNjcxOTIyMg==","user":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-20T20:33:21Z","updated_at":"2018-07-20T20:33:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"retest
