I installed alembic and have a migrations folder to manage changes to the metadata database. Here's the premise of what I changed and assumptions:\n\nIf a user already has airflow running, they can issue a new command called `airflow upgradedb` and that will migrate any new database changes that need to happen over time. Running this command will be required when a user upgrades airflow when it has db migrations in the release. This also assumes that from this point forward the user will be on at least version 1.3.0. If the db schema does not include changes up to 1.3.0, the user will be out of luck (maybe we can create a migration file to get people up to speed).\n\nIf the user is creating airflow from scratch, all of the migrations and current quickstart guide will run as expected `airflow initdb` and the versioning will be created in the database properly. \n\nFor those wanting to help develop and need to create a database migration the workflow would look something like this:\n\n```\n$ pwd\n~/airflow\n$ cd airflow\n$ alembic revision -m \"add new field to db\"\n  Generating ~/airflow/airflow/migrations/versions/12341123_add_new_field_to_db.py\n```\n\nFrom there, the appropriate steps can be taken to do the migration or what ever else needs to be taken care of. \n\nThis pull request kinda went in all sorts of directions. Let me know if this isn't what you were expecting and I can change it. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/132438809/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/132590687","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/260#issuecomment-132590687","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/260","id":132590687,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMjU5MDY4Nw==","user":{"login":"jlowin","id":153965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Mzk2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/153965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin","html_url":"https://github.com/jlowin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-19T13:18:29Z","updated_at":"2015-08-19T13:18:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@mistercrunch just updated:\n1. Separated `XCom.get_one` and `XCom.get_many`. `xcom_pull()` calls `get_one()` (potentially multiple times) and removes the need to worry about limits or handling complex returns. Users who really need multiple XComs can call `get_many` directly; if it turns out there's demand we can easily wrap `pull_many` (but let's wait and see).\n2. Added \"soft\" uniqueness by deleting any matching XComs before new ones are `set()`. I don't think a unique constraint works for the reason described above. I think that using `get_one()` eliminates the need to worry about this anyway, since it will always pull the most recent XCom.\n3. Had to add back the `expunge_all` and `commit` because it looks like `@providesession` calls `expunge_all` and therefore doesn't allow objects to be added.

To make use of the Kerberos support the different hooks need to updated. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/132799899/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/132898991","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/275#issuecomment-132898991","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/275","id":132898991,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMjg5ODk5MQ==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-20T05:35:09Z","updated_at":"2015-08-20T05:35:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Are you using LocalExecutor or CeleryExecutor?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/132898991/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/132899762","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/276#issuecomment-132899762","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/276","id":132899762,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMjg5OTc2Mg==","user":{"login":"askeys","id":2008048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDgwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2008048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/askeys","html_url":"https://github.com/askeys","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/askeys/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/askeys/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/askeys/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/askeys/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/askeys/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/askeys/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/askeys/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/askeys/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/askeys/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-20T05:43:34Z","updated_at":"2015-08-20T05:43:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":":+1: awesome, happy you could get this in so quick.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/132899762/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/132902794","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/260#issuecomment-132902794","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/260","id":132902794,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMjkwMjc5NA==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-20T06:06:05Z","updated_at":"2015-08-20T06:06:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I think this is solid now.

I think allowing DAGs to reconfigure themselves while in flight would require a total rethinking of the architecture.\n\nHowever, there are a couple of possible directions to go:\n1. Add dynamics inside an operator. `PythonOperators` can execute arbitrary code with as few or as many \"chunks\" as required. \n2. The `PythonBranchOperator` can implement conditional paths within a DAG, so long as those paths are known in advance. Right now, I think it's mostly useful for \"short circuiting\" paths that you don't want to run, but once #261 is merged, they will add a lot of versatility.\n3. Lastly -- most experimentally -- I'm exploring an idea with a restricted subset of dynamic DAGs in which the tasks are _mostly_ the same but could vary regularly. For example, lets say I have a DAG that has a task for processing each of N files, where N could change day to day (probably becoming N+1). In this case, I know exactly what tasks I'm going to need prior to each time I run my DAG (since I can count the files). So in theory, I _could_ generate the appropriate DAG for every run. In other words, I don't need to by dynamic during the run, only before it.\n   \n   The problem is, Airflow only refreshes DAGs periodically (workers seem to do it more frequently, the web server less, and then only if a scheduler is running). @mistercrunch has commented on this in #116  and #46. So the trick is finding a way to refresh the DAG across the system. One way to do this is to manually expire the DAG when you are finished with it.<sup>[1](#fn)</sup> This means that the next time a worker/server/process tries to load the DAG, it will refresh it because it sees that the current version is obsolete. But this might be expensive or infeasible with large DAGs. \n   \n   I emphasize that I'm experimenting with this and have not explored any side effects yet. For example, this could potentially introduce/remove tasks and create UI issues. I don't know yet and don't want to go as far as to endorse this -- just sparking conversation.\n\n<a name=\"fn\">1</a>: I'm doing this manually right now but it could be an interesting Operator... put it at the end of a DAG... but I have a feeling @mistercrunch doesn't want to make this too easy ;) \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/133699874/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/133754618","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/289#issuecomment-133754618","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/289","id":133754618,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMzc1NDYxOA==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-22T20:59:47Z","updated_at":"2015-08-22T20:59:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Airflow currently thinks of a workflow as a mostly static, or slowly changing DAG of tasks. Different run instances are schedule based on a fixed schedule. \n\nHaving a fixed unit of work over time and a fixed schedule bring a lot of clarity (and some constraints) to workflows. For instance it allows for the Tree, Duration and Landing time views. It also allows for things like looking at resource consumption metadata over time and understand how things are changing.\n\nIt's all about how you define your unit of work, and you can pivot into doing things the Airflow way. So say if you receive an unpredictable stream of files, you can pivot into have a task that batches whatever landed in that folder since the last run and label the output based on the schedule. Once you've pivoted to a time based unit of work, things from that point are hourly jobs and align properly. At many companies, pivoting to fixed schedule batch approach happens far upstream in their data pipelines.\n\nNow you could want to instantiate a DAG for each file, and change the workflow based on the content of the file or the nature of the file, that's reasonable and how programmers think in general. \n\nThe static-ish workflow approach is different. Is assumes you already know all the routes that can be taken, and wire the data down the pipes. So if you have 5 types of files that require different processing, maybe you need 5 sub-paths in your workflow that each treat a subset of the files.\n\nBut hey, I do see tons of value for \"singleton\" DAGs that are triggered by events, not all workflows are on a schedule! The whole \"analytics as a service\" is filled with \"run just one time, or run on demand\" use cases. I think it makes sense for Airflow to grow into allowing that as a first class use case. It's very easy to hack this together while dynamically generating DAGs (each with different `dag_id`) and forcing a dummy single `start_date` and `end_date`. I'd be curious to see how much mileage you'd get out of this approach. Feel free to give it a spin, all you have to do is to stamp differents DAGs as objects in the global namespace of your pipeline, as in:\n\n```\nfor i in range(10):\n    dag_id = 'my_dynamic_dag_number_' + str(i)\n    globals()[dag_id] = DAG(dag_id=dag_id)\n```\n\nThese 10 DAGs should get discovered as any other would.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/133754618/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/133779894","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/290#issuecomment-133779894","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/290","id":133779894,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMzc3OTg5NA==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-23T04:24:48Z","updated_at":"2015-08-23T04:24:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Could you just use symlinks to do this?
