Regarding the timezone issue, I think it's something that runs slightly deeper in the code, so would probably require some additional planning (perhaps a SIP). Perhaps something along the lines of a setting in `superset_config.py` to specify a timezone in which all timestamps with timezone info would be cast to (naive timestamps would probably be kept unchanged)?
