Let me first talk about what I have observed.  I was testing the windowing function that was recently merged into master.  I have a topology that has one instance of a spout and one instance of a bolt.  The spout emits a tuple every second.  However, for the first several tuples the bolt would receive them all at once and not in the time interval that the spout has sent them.  And this only happens at the beginning of a topology. \r\n\r\nI think I have found the reason.  The doWait function for the NIOLooper:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/twitter/heron/blob/master/heron/common/src/java/com/twitter/heron/common/basics/NIOLooper.java#L53\r\n\r\nis blocking for around 4 seconds before it timeout causing readStreamMessageIfNeeded:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/twitter/heron/blob/master/heron/instance/src/java/com/twitter/heron/network/StreamManagerClient.java#L104\r\n\r\nnot to be called for that duration thus tuples are not read during that time.  Not sure why the selector there is blocking until it times out.  \r\n\r\nThough the code in this patch still fixes the issue or at least side steps it.\r\n\r\nStill need to investigate why the selector is blocking for that long","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/326732774/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/326733418","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/2278#issuecomment-326733418","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/2278","id":326733418,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNjczMzQxOA==","user":{"login":"maosongfu","id":3028698,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMjg2OTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3028698?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu","html_url":"https://github.com/maosongfu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-02T09:29:01Z","updated_at":"2017-09-02T09:29:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jerrypeng \r\nThanks for sharing the context.

Currently the logic is as follows\r\n1. We start reading from stmgr if either we have capacity to absorb messages or if helper is null(that is assignment is not done). This ensures that we read the assignment message\r\n2. Once we read the assignment message we promptly stopReading from stmgr(which is fine)\r\n3. But after assignment message is processed by the slave, I would have expected us to start reading stmgr immediately. Rather what happens is that nobody informs the gateway thread about this. After around 5 seconds the slave thread wakes up(not sure who is doing that) and then it realizes that it now has capacity to absorb and thus starts reading from stmgr.\r\nMy feeling is that this change wont be necessary if we figure out why slave thread is not communicating back to the gateway thread after processing the assignment message.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/326736945/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/326775145","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/2278#issuecomment-326775145","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/2278","id":326775145,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNjc3NTE0NQ==","user":{"login":"maosongfu","id":3028698,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMjg2OTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3028698?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu","html_url":"https://github.com/maosongfu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-02T23:39:22Z","updated_at":"2017-09-02T23:39:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jerrypeng @srkukarni \r\nI went through the code and I found the issue.

My only question is once this change merged, does the `heron-client.tar.gz` still has `heron-examples.jar` with it? The `heron-examples.jar` is really useful for verification and debugging purpose. Hope we can keep this unchanged.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/328958417/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/328964305","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/2297#issuecomment-328964305","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/2297","id":328964305,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyODk2NDMwNQ==","user":{"login":"nlu90","id":16407807,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDA3ODA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16407807?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlu90","html_url":"https://github.com/nlu90","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlu90/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlu90/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlu90/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlu90/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlu90/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlu90/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlu90/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlu90/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlu90/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-12T19:46:52Z","updated_at":"2017-09-12T19:47:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Some more metrics with some more fixes in the `sanjeevk/moveto_bufferevent` branch:\r\n\r\nCPU:\r\n![pasted image at 2017_09_12 10_22 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16407807/30344840-c48f5b04-97b7-11e7-9bec-57300f7d5488.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nSpout Emit Count:\r\n![pasted image at 2017_09_12 10_22 am 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16407807/30344861-d30762e4-97b7-11e7-8efc-cb3792352b89.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nBolt Execute Count:\r\n![pasted image at 2017_09_12 10_23 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16407807/30344878-dc4018c4-97b7-11e7-9391-91567d50705a.png)\r\n\r\nAnd I also investigated that the CPUs are different for the two topologies' containers.
