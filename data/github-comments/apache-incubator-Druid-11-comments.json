I'm not sure but I think it may be caused by the customized class loader in Druid rather than about HDFS itself, because the `hadoop classpath` solution proves that it should be OK in traditional class path loader for `hadoop-hdfs` but how should it not work for Druid? Especially when druid's log prints:\n\n```\nINFO [main] io.druid.initialization.Initialization - Added URL[file:/home/druid/.m2/repository/org/apache/hadoop/hadoop-hdfs/2.3.0/hadoop-hdfs-2.3.0.jar]\n```\n\nSurely, I also agree with the opinion about disconnecting Druid with any particular Hadoop version. So i think we have two options here:\n- **Option 1:** If druid is still willing to help users to load all jar dependencies like what `hdfs-storage-extension` does for us, it should fix the bug as in this PR. And in fact it has nothing to do hadoop version, because `hadoop-hdfs` basic API is very stable and mature, and they seems intended to let their users to handle about it.\n- **Option 2:** If druid really prefers users to add hadoop related dependencies by hands, the POM scope of `hadoop-client`  dependency here [extensions/hdfs-storage/pom.xml#L58](https://github.com/druid-io/druid/blob/master/extensions/hdfs-storage/pom.xml#L58) should be changed from `compile` to `provided`, right? And it should also make sure Druid module loader not to load additional dependent `hadoop-hdfs` jars into local MAVEN repository, otherwise the JVM will always load at least two different versions of `hadoop-hdfs` jars which may cause some other unknown and confused problems:\n  \n  ```\n  $ lsof -p 17094 | grep hadoop-hdfs\n  java    17094 druid  mem    REG              252,0  5783912   774885 /home/druid/.m2/repository/org/apache/hadoop/hadoop-hdfs/2.3.0/hadoop-hdfs-2.3.0.jar\n  java    17094 druid  mem    REG              252,0  7822243   774161 /usr/hdp/2.2.0.0-2041/hadoop-hdfs/hadoop-hdfs-2.6.0.2.2.0.0-2041.jar\n  java    17094 druid  229r   REG              252,0  7822243   774161 /usr/hdp/2.2.0.0-2041/hadoop-hdfs/hadoop-hdfs-2.6.0.2.2.0.0-2041.jar\n  java    17094 druid  472r   REG              252,0  5783912   774885 /home/druid/.m2/repository/org/apache/hadoop/hadoop-hdfs/2.3.0/hadoop-hdfs-2.3.0.jar\n  ```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/69482266/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/69546519","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/706#issuecomment-69546519","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/706","id":69546519,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5NTQ2NTE5","user":{"login":"swistakm","id":1258054,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTgwNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1258054?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swistakm","html_url":"https://github.com/swistakm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swistakm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swistakm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swistakm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swistakm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swistakm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swistakm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swistakm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swistakm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swistakm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-12T09:42:31Z","updated_at":"2015-01-12T09:43:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Any plans for updating docs?
