The rational being that through the decades of sw engineering practice implicit casts have caused more grief than provided in convenience. Secondly, the observation that sw code is read many time more than it is written also points to using explicit casts, so that all the information is present in the code being read.\r\n\r\nIn numerical software, explicit casting is used to implement numerical adapters (re-discretization, float/integer, and encoding conversion), and for high-performance and OS/driver software to access very specific attributes of the number (the frexp functions). The numerical adapter use case is readily present in DL.\r\n\r\nImplicit casting requires that you design a type hierarchy with associated conversion rules. However, even simple languages like C have shown that these type hierarchies are difficult to make consistent. With user-defined types, your type hierarchy is unlikely to be complete and/or consistent, and thus you'll create backward compatibility nightmares that will make your implicit casting code not maintainable.  \r\n\r\nSo, there really isn't a good reason to implement implicit casting in any way, shape, or form.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/467391536/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/467610324","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2675#issuecomment-467610324","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2675","id":467610324,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NzYxMDMyNA==","user":{"login":"hlu1","id":14827759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODI3NzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14827759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlu1","html_url":"https://github.com/hlu1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlu1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlu1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlu1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlu1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlu1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlu1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlu1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlu1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlu1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-26T20:57:08Z","updated_at":"2019-02-26T20:57:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Why nnvm?

I'm going to redo it to get more up-to-date numbers. NNPACK has two implementations for convolution with winograd transform, wt8x8 and wt8x8_fp16. The fp16 implementation is usually the 20% - 30% faster than the fp32 version. On ARM CPUs with fp16 compute support (only Cortex-A76 I believe), NNPACK would run the microkernel with fp16 compute. On other ARM CPUs with fp16 support but not fp16 compute, NNPACK uses fp16 for intermediate storage only (eg. transformed input and kernel, see https://github.com/Maratyszcza/NNPACK/blob/master/src/init.c#L469-L491). It'll be hard to beat NNPACK without fp16.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/468160133/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/468164742","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2694#issuecomment-468164742","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2694","id":468164742,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2ODE2NDc0Mg==","user":{"login":"SiNZeRo","id":1358421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTg0MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1358421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiNZeRo","html_url":"https://github.com/SiNZeRo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiNZeRo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiNZeRo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiNZeRo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiNZeRo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiNZeRo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiNZeRo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiNZeRo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiNZeRo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiNZeRo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-28T07:17:59Z","updated_at":"2019-02-28T07:17:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Thanks I tested two tutorials locally.
