One general concern I have is about the encapsulation of the solution. It seems that we are mixing code that should be logically separated, e.g., pushing computation to ```DruidQuery``` via rules vs generation of JSON for Druid. For instance, this results in needing to add a placeholder to ```DruidQuery``` to hold the JSON ```postAggs```.\r\n\r\nGeneration of the JSON code should still be encapsulated, thus one recommendation is to split the logic that validates/pushes computation to ```DruidQuery``` (this should still be done by ```DruidPostAggregationProjectRule```) from the logic that generates the JSON code (currently done within ```DruidQuery```). In addition to make the code of the rule more readable, that would also allow us to hold all the relational ops that we have pushed to ```DruidQuery``` within ```rels```. Currently the post-aggregation ```Project``` is removed, which means that we cannot obtain the equivalent relational expression that the ```DruidQuery``` is computing by looking at ```rels```. I think that is an interesting property to keep.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/310079942/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/310154026","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/471#issuecomment-310154026","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/471","id":310154026,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMDE1NDAyNg==","user":{"login":"axeisghost","id":10549439,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTQ5NDM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10549439?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/axeisghost","html_url":"https://github.com/axeisghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axeisghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axeisghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axeisghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axeisghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axeisghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axeisghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axeisghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axeisghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axeisghost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-21T17:44:45Z","updated_at":"2017-06-21T17:44:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks, @jcamachor \r\nYour concern is right.

Basically the planner checks whether the row type of an operator produced by a rule is equal to the row type of the operator that was matched by the rule, including nullability. We were discussing whether it would make sense to lift that restriction, but till we do that, we should not turn it off by default for rules such as ```ProjectReduceExpressionsRule``` or we might run into that AssertionError. Does that make sense?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/342695360/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/342709549","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/560#issuecomment-342709549","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/560","id":342709549,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MjcwOTU0OQ==","user":{"login":"julianhyde","id":1130553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzA1NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1130553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde","html_url":"https://github.com/julianhyde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-08T04:44:55Z","updated_at":"2017-11-08T04:44:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Reviewers: let's keep this PR open until there is something more substantial.
