I removed `webserver` component in the response. It's meaningless to have it here given the endpoint would never work if the webserver is unhealthy.\r\n\r\n2. The response format is standardized. The format will be\r\n\r\n```JSON\r\n  {\r\n    \"metadatabase\":{\r\n      \"status\":\"healthy\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"scheduler\":{\r\n      \"status\":\"healthy\",\r\n      \"latest_scheduler_run\":\"2018-12-26 17:15:11+00:00\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. The same as the last commit in this PR: **no authentication will be required for accessing the `/health` endpoint.** \r\n\r\n4. Given no authentication would be required for accessing it, we should be careful about what we expose via this endpoint. This is why I didn't add `open_connections` for `metadatabase` (cc @kaxil ). This should also be the principle for this endpoint in the future.\r\n\r\n5. For more detailed monitoring, users should use something else, like a `/metrics` endpoint. Personally I think it's good to have both `/health` and `/metrics` (they are different. `/health` only provides very high-level information). For `/metrics`, for sure authentication and Admin privilege should be required.\r\n\r\n6. Following what @ashb pointed out, documentation is added to share the details of this endpoint, including highlighting response code of this `/health` endpoint should not be used for health-check purpose.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/449681029/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/449683851","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4309#issuecomment-449683851","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4309","id":449683851,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0OTY4Mzg1MQ==","user":{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-24T04:12:30Z","updated_at":"2018-12-24T04:12:30Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"1

Hostpath should just be a volume mount like any other, and frankly I don't really want to actively encourage people to use it (it's generally not advised and I think there's even been talk about deprecating it).
