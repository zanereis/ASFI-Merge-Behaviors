Something like [maven](https://hub.docker.com/_/maven) probably work if you volume mount your source directory. Either that or a linux vm (either local or hosted) are options.\r\n\r\nI played around a little bit on a Windows VM, and discovered that WSL 2 works quite well if that's an option for you. I installed the Ubuntu 20.04 distro and had to install JDK, Maven, make, and g++ and I was able to do a build w/o tests. Docker for Windows made me install WSL (there is a hyper-v option too, but didn't work for me since I was already in a VM I think), so no benefit to Docker in that case. If you want Docker for other reasons (e.g., not installing tools), unfortunately the maven images don't quite work since they don't include the necessary tools to build the native libs. It's pretty easy to build an image on top of the maven ones, though. For example, I had the following Dockerfile to build an image:\r\n```dockerfile\r\nFROM maven:3-jdk-11-slim\r\nRUN apt-get update && apt install -y g++ make && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\r\n```\r\nWith my custom image, I was able to do a full build (again, skipping test execution). I just followed the instructions on the [maven](https://hub.docker.com/_/maven) image page for running and also to reuse the m2 repository (you don't want to have to download all of the dependencies every time).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/830194140/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/830213251","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/2062#issuecomment-830213251","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/2062","id":830213251,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgzMDIxMzI1MQ==","user":{"login":"Umang228","id":80462589,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNDYyNTg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80462589?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Umang228","html_url":"https://github.com/Umang228","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Umang228/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Umang228/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Umang228/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Umang228/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Umang228/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Umang228/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Umang228/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Umang228/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Umang228/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-30T16:30:34Z","updated_at":"2021-04-30T16:30:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Assign me this...\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/830213251/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/830215754","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/2001#issuecomment-830215754","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/2001","id":830215754,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgzMDIxNTc1NA==","user":{"login":"milleruntime","id":11872539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODcyNTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11872539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime","html_url":"https://github.com/milleruntime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-30T16:34:57Z","updated_at":"2021-04-30T16:34:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ctubbsii A big problem that I have run into while trying to make the CryptoService table aware (with an implementation like the balancer) is providing the tableName (or tableId) through the RFile client classes.

Something like [maven](https://hub.docker.com/_/maven) probably work if you volume mount your source directory. Either that or a linux vm (either local or hosted) are options.\r\n> \r\n> I played around a little bit on a Windows VM, and discovered that WSL 2 works quite well if that's an option for you. I installed the Ubuntu 20.04 distro and had to install JDK, Maven, make, and g++ and I was able to do a build w/o tests. Docker for Windows made me install WSL (there is a hyper-v option too, but didn't work for me since I was already in a VM I think), so no benefit to Docker in that case. If you want Docker for other reasons (e.g., not installing tools), unfortunately the maven images don't quite work since they don't include the necessary tools to build the native libs. It's pretty easy to build an image on top of the maven ones, though. For example, I had the following Dockerfile to build an image:\r\n> \r\n> ```dockerfile\r\n> FROM maven:3-jdk-11-slim\r\n> RUN apt-get update && apt install -y g++ make && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> With my custom image, I was able to do a full build (again, skipping test execution).
