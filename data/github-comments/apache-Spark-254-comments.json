I’m fine with reworking based on other changes (it seems that some merge conflicts have already cropped up in master since I submitted my PR last week). I think my change set is a little simpler than the one you linked to, so would it make sense for me to wait until that one goes in?\n\nI also thought I’d add a couple of notes on what I had in mind with this patch:\n\n1) I added a new Row serialization pathway between python and java, based on JList[Array[Byte]] versus the existing RDD[Array[Byte]]. I wasn’t overjoyed about doing this, but I noticed that some QueryPlans implement optimizations in executeCollect(), which outputs an Array[Row] rather than the typical RDD[Row] that can be shipped to python using the existing serialization code. To me it made sense to ship the Array[Row] over to python directly instead of converting it back to an RDD[Row] just for the purpose of sending the Rows to python using the existing serialization code. But let me know if you have any thoughts about this.\n\n2) I moved JavaStackTrace from rdd.py to context.py. This made sense to me since JavaStackTrace is all about configuring a context attribute, and the _extract_concise_traceback function it depends on was already being called separately from context.py (as a ‘private’ function of rdd.py).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50577338/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50577383","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1648#issuecomment-50577383","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1648","id":50577383,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNTc3Mzgz","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-30T06:13:51Z","updated_at":"2014-07-30T06:13:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA tests have started for PR 1648.

@nkronenfeld - I traced through the exact function call more closely and I actually think it's fine. The issue I pointed out in the JIRA is orthogonal. So I'm fine to just revert this back to always showing the status. However, we should not mark this as a developer API. This is a stable API we are happy to support forever.\n\nStill, this will cause a significant amount of object allocation due to the way other internal function calls happen (it is basically O(all blocks)) for an application. It might be nice to add a note to the docs that the operation might be expensive and should not be called inside of a critical code path. Though we could likely optimize those things down the road.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50579659/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50579747","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1498#issuecomment-50579747","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1498","id":50579747,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNTc5NzQ3","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-30T06:49:08Z","updated_at":"2014-07-30T06:49:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA tests have started for PR 1498.

[`String#getBytes(charset)`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#getBytes%28java.lang.String%29)`.length` like:\n\n``` scala\nscala> \"\\uF93D\\uF936\\uF949\\uF942\".getBytes(\"utf8\").length // chinese characters\nres0: Int = 12\n\nscala> \"\\uD840\\uDC0B\\uD842\\uDFB7\".getBytes(\"utf8\").length // 2 surrogate pairs\nres1: Int = 8\n\nscala> \"1234567890ABC\".getBytes(\"utf8\").length\nres2: Int = 13\n\nscala> \"\\uF93D\\uF936\\uF949\\uF942\".getBytes(\"utf16\").length // chinese characters\nres3: Int = 10\n\nscala> \"\\uD840\\uDC0B\\uD842\\uDFB7\".getBytes(\"utf16\").length // 2 surrogate pairs\nres4: Int = 10\n\nscala> \"1234567890ABC\".getBytes(\"utf16\").length\nres5: Int = 28\n\nscala> \"\\uF93D\\uF936\\uF949\\uF942\".getBytes(\"utf32\").length // chinese characters\nres6: Int = 16\n\nscala> \"\\uD840\\uDC0B\\uD842\\uDFB7\".getBytes(\"utf32\").length // 2 surrogate pairs\nres7: Int = 8\n\nscala> \"1234567890ABC\".getBytes(\"utf32\").length\nres8: Int = 52\n```\n\nAt first I guessed you wanted 3) for `Strlen` because charset related length is only 3), but I watched a conversation indicating another type of \"length\" and lost it halfway.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50637172/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50640365","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1648#issuecomment-50640365","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1648","id":50640365,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNjQwMzY1","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-30T16:27:10Z","updated_at":"2014-07-30T16:27:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Jenkins,
