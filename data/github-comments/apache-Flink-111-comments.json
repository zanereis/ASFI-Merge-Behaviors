good changes and great that you added the `JobStatus` graph transitions figure to the docs.\n\nI looked at all changes and tests. Furthermore, I've tested this with lost ZooKeeper connections and it works as expected. The job is suspended and recovered smoothly. 👍 \n\nSome general notes:\n- The only thing that might be slightly confusing for users is that until the web frontend is notified about the leader changes, it shows the job status as FAILED until it disappears. This is probably some web interface quirk, because it does not recognize the new job status. I understand that you remove suspended job graphs and don't archive them (which makes sense as they are recovered later), but giving that it takes some time until all information propagates to the web frontend, we might want to temporarily show the state as suspended. We can do this as a follow up.\n- Regarding the removal of restart strategy disabling, I thought about whether we should leave it in and get rid of the `SuppressRestartsException` instead. That seems to be cleaner than the custom exception, which is checked in the `ExecutionGraph`.

Putting it in different place would mean placing it in `BroadcastingOutputCollector`, as you mentioned, as well as in https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/master/flink-streaming-java/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/streaming/api/collector/selector/DirectedOutput.java, which is used when the user does a split()/select() operation (`DataStream.split()`). The number of places where we have to put this might evolve in the future.\n\nAlso, putting it in `BroadcastingOutputCollector` and `DirectedOutput` would mean that we always do two copies per record for the common case of having object-copying enabled (which is the default).\n\nAbout the ITCase. I also don't like having that in there because we are approaching the 2h mark on Travis but I think in this case it's valid. This test really verifies that the whole system works correctly when the user uses a certain feature (I would also add a test for split()/select() now that I thought about it). \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/227994869/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/227997193","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2110#issuecomment-227997193","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2110","id":227997193,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNzk5NzE5Mw==","user":{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-23T09:29:49Z","updated_at":"2016-06-23T09:29:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'll try and come up with something, I'll probably remove the `isInputCopyDisabled` from operator and only allow a global setting for object reuse.

This implies that the jobs will no longer be shown in the web interface.\n- I agree that it is a good idea to replace the `SuppressRestartException` by a mechanism to disable the `RestartStrategies`. I've opened a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-4112) to keep track of the effort. I think, however, that the mechanism should be implemented as part of the work on this issue. That way we won't mix pull requests with each other.\n- You're right. I've addressed the comment and added `SUSPENDED` to the set of states which don't throw an exception when encountered in `ExecutionGraph.restart`.\n- You're right concerning the `JobManagerProcess` tests.

In this context we also added the `FileParhFilter` class. As an example you can see the `readFile(FileInputFormat<OUT> inputFormat, String filePath, FileProcessingMode watchType, long interval, FilePathFilter filter)` in the `StreamExecutionEnvironment`.\n\nWhat I would suggest in order to have this functionality for both batch and streaming, is to remove it from a parameter in the configuration file, and pass the `FilePathFilter` as an argument to the constructor of the `FileInputFormat` and then do the filtering the same way you do it. The reason is:\n\n1) Cleaner code, as we will not have 2 different ways to do the same thing\n2) Better usability, as you can imagine a scenario where an administrator sets a global path filter and then the user another one. In this case, which should be respected?\n3) Overloading the configuration file with job specific stuff is probably not the best way to go.\n\nThis may also require some changes in the internal implementation of the readFile in the Streaming API, although I am not 100% sure.\n\nThanks for the PR!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/228332228/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/228340544","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2159#issuecomment-228340544","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2159","id":228340544,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyODM0MDU0NA==","user":{"login":"mushketyk","id":592286,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MjI4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/592286?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk","html_url":"https://github.com/mushketyk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-24T13:08:03Z","updated_at":"2016-06-24T13:08:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I

It works and have not come across problems.\n\nHave a few other questions on the usage of the connector (I haven't went through the code thoroughly enough yet and am not an expert Redis user, so I apologize if I may be missing things in asking them). Most of them are my own opinion from a user's point of view:\n\n1) as a user, I think the current way of giving secondary key for `HASH` and `SORTED_SET` is a bit confusing. Is the current design a common usage pattern across Redis client libraries? If not, IMO, perhaps a `getSecondaryKeyFromData` in the `RedisMapper` interface will be more explicit.\n2) I wonder what's the reason for having our own `JedisPoolConfig`, when Jedis has its own `JedisPoolConfig`? If there's a need for it for Flink-specific `RedisSink` settings, perhaps the name conflict is a bit misleading?\n3) Would it be better to have a `RedisDataType.PUB` instead of `RedisDataType.PUBSUB` to better acknowledge the `publish` method on Jedis clients? We can have `RedisDataType.SUB` when we add a Redis source to the connector.\n4) Can `RedisDataType.LIST` be changed to `RedisDataType.LPUSH` and `RedisDataType.RPUSH`? If it isn't too hard to add, the connector would be much more useful with this.\n5) In general, I have the feeling that `RedisDataType` should be named as `RedisCommandType`, as the `RedisMapper` is actually mapping the incoming data to a Redis command / action.\n6) The current design creates Redis sinks with a fixed `RedisDataType` and additional secondary key. What's the reason for this design, instead of letting the `RedisMapper` choose the command to use for each record?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/228526868/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/228537458","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1813#issuecomment-228537458","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1813","id":228537458,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyODUzNzQ1OA==","user":{"login":"mjsax","id":8959638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NTk2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8959638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax","html_url":"https://github.com/mjsax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-25T12:18:40Z","updated_at":"2016-06-25T12:18:40Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@tzulitai Thank a lot for testing this! Your feedback is really great!\n\n1) I am not a Redis users either -- from my understanding, the second key determined the field that would be updated -- it makes sense to me, that this field is the same for all updates (ie, independent of the data itself). Thus, it would not make sense to extract it from the record via `RedisMapper`.\n2) Might be confusing for Redis users (I did not stumble over it as a no-user ;)) -- renaming seems reasonable -- maybe `RedisSinkConfig` ?\n3+4) Well, the data type is the same, no matter if you want to read or write it. But I agree, that using the date type itself in `RedisSink` might not be sufficient. I think the idea to support `LPUSH` was, that Flink as a streaming system might do best to append at the tail, not at the head... \n5) Similar to my answer to (4) -- the data type is the same -- independently what operation you perform on it. And you state yourself, that `RedisMapper` maps the type to the command/action.\n6) See my answer to (1)\n\nAs a non-Redis users, it is hard for me to judge what flexibility is required/expected by users (ie, secondary key per record or not?). It also seems, that not all available action (LPUSH vs RPUSH) are implemented. How important is it, to support all action -- do you think, that the current once cover the most basic subset to get started with. It might be good, to just start with a subset of commands, and add new commands later on (just a suggestion). And do the think the implemented actions for each type are the most useful? If we want to support multiple different actions per data type, it would be a larger refactoring of this code I think.\n\n@subhankarb @rmetzger What is your opinion on this?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/228537458/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/228539552","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1813#issuecomment-228539552","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1813","id":228539552,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyODUzOTU1Mg==","user":{"login":"tzulitai","id":5284370,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODQzNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5284370?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai","html_url":"https://github.com/tzulitai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-25T13:04:56Z","updated_at":"2016-06-25T13:04:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @mjsax,\n\nRegarding 1): just came to me that for SORTED_SET, a fixed secondary key doesn't make sense, because the secondary key is supposed to define the order of the inserted element in the set.

`SetOperatorsITCase`\n3. remove INTERSECT Java API tests \n4. add the `intersectAll` function to `Table`\n5. mark `testIntersectAll` as `@ignore` in `sql/SetOperatorsITCase`, because calcite sql parser doesn't support INTERSECT ALL, it will throw the following exception:\n\n```\njava.lang.AssertionError: Internal error: set operator INTERSECT ALL not suported\n\n  at

For `HASH`\nit is the value of hash name and `SORTED_SET` it is the name of the set. I assume it would not change once it declares. \n\n2) `JedisPoolConfig`/ `JedisClusterConfig` were not `Serializable` so i needed a wrapper class for that. @mjsax there is a story for a source for Redis, so `RedisSinkConfig` would not be a valid one as the config would be same for sink and source. Thats why i make the `JedisPoolConfig`/ `JedisClusterConfig` ctor private. So that user forced to use the builder class to avoid confusion. \n\n3) When i started with this i thought it was obvious that if i use PUBSUB in sink, i would always use it for publish and if i use this in source i would always use it for subscribe  :) .  \n\n4 + 5 ) We can group the command and dataType like.\n\n`public enum RedisCommand {\nLPUSH(RedisDataType.LIST),\nRPUSH(RedisDataType.LIST);\nprivate RedisDataType redisDataType;\nRedisCommand(RedisDataType redisDataType) {\n  this.redisDataType = redisDataType;\n}\npublic boolean isInRedisDataType(RedisDataType redisDataType) {\n  return this.redisDataType == redisDataType;\n}\n}`\nAnd in `RedisDataTypeDescription` we can extract the command . So that in future we can add new command. Really like the idea of keeping provision to add new command, but should we do it right now or later. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/228686793/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/228691786","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1813#issuecomment-228691786","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1813","id":228691786,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyODY5MTc4Ng==","user":{"login":"tzulitai","id":5284370,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODQzNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5284370?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai","html_url":"https://github.com/tzulitai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-27T09:07:21Z","updated_at":"2016-06-27T09:11:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @subhankarb,\n\nSorry, I just read the code. I didn't realize you were using the `additionalKey` as the `setName` for `SORTED_SET` until just now.\n\nI think this might be quite confusing for Redis users. For Redis users, for sorted sets the `setName` is considered as the primary key, and the per-value score in the set is considered the additional / secondary key. It works the same for the hash data type: the hash fields are considered additional / secondary keys. So right now, the usage principal for `SORTED_SET` and `HASH` in the `RedisSink` seems to be opposite to each other? i.e., one is using the `additionalKey` in `RedisDataTypeDescription` as primary key, while the other is treating it as a secondary key.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/228691786/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/228691955","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2134#issuecomment-228691955","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2134","id":228691955,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyODY5MTk1NQ==","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-27T09:08:10Z","updated_at":"2016-06-27T09:08:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"merging\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/228691955/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/228691967","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2112#issuecomment-228691967","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2112","id":228691967,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyODY5MTk2Nw==","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-27T09:08:13Z","updated_at":"2016-06-27T09:08:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"merging\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/228691967/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/228692374","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2157#issuecomment-228692374","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2157","id":228692374,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyODY5MjM3NA==","user":{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-27T09:10:11Z","updated_at":"2016-06-27T09:10:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the PR!
