It's easy to reproduce:\r\n1. Open more tabs than will fit in the width of the tab bar (or resize the window)\r\n2. Click the right arrow button to reveal tabs to the right (not always necessary)\r\n3. Move your mouse over the leftmost tab that is just visible\r\n\r\nThere is no close button visible, but the tooltip indicates it will close and clicking does in fact close the tab.\r\n\r\nThis appears to be an issue when using FlatLaf, but not with Metal (I haven't tried other LaFs).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1385640132/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1385720615","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/5301#issuecomment-1385720615","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5301","id":1385720615,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5SmGsn","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-17T16:49:54Z","updated_at":"2023-01-17T16:49:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closing -
