Trivial changes like typos\n>    do not require a JIRA issue.

again, thanks Eugene, for your review!\r\nTo answer your question, no this PR does not increase test coverage, there is nothing more than what I wrote in the description: the aim is just to be able to use `GenericRecord[]` as input, and to read output file with `GenericRecord` Avro API for AvroIO `GenericRecord` related tests.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/334745074/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/334746856","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3953#issuecomment-334746856","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3953","id":334746856,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNDc0Njg1Ng==","user":{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-06T12:56:24Z","updated_at":"2017-10-06T12:56:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Run

to answer your question: for `DynamicDestinations` it will work just the same as before: if the user extends `DynamicAvroDestinations` and provides a schema by overriding `getSchema()` for example from a side input, then `DynamicAvroDestinations.getSchema()` will not return null. So in `AvroSink` this returned schema will have the precedence and the previous implementation code will be executed (no lazy init and no schema determination at write time).
