The NPE occurs on this line of `doRewrite`, because `sourceOf` does not contain the key `aggCall.filterArg`:\r\n```java\r\n      final int newFilterArg =\r\n          aggCall.filterArg >= 0 ? sourceOf.get(aggCall.filterArg) : -1;\r\n```\r\n2. `sourceOf` comes from this section above, in the same `doRewrite` method:\r\n```java\r\n    // Project the columns of the GROUP BY plus the arguments\r\n    // to the agg function.\r\n    final Map<Integer, Integer> sourceOf = new HashMap<>();\r\n    createSelectDistinct(relBuilder, aggregate, argList, filterArg, sourceOf);\r\n```\r\n3. The `createSelectDistinct` function populates `sourceOf` for each arg of `argList` and mixes in the `filterArg` input ref into each one. It does not populate `sourceOf` for the `filterArg` itself (it seems to be trying to rewrite filtered aggregations as a DISTINCT of a CASE statement).\r\n4. The combination o f(1) and (3) above is bad, since `doRewrite` is trying to pull `sourceOf.get(aggCall.filterArg)`, which won't be there, since `createSelectDistinct` is (seemingly intentionally) not populating it.\r\n\r\nI'm not totally sure where the bug is, but it seems to me that it's probably the part where `doRewrite` tries to create `newFilterArg` (item 1 above). `createSelectDistinct` seemingly intentionally rewrites filtered aggregations as non-filtered aggregations, so `doRewrite` should not be trying to create a `newFilterArg`.\r\n\r\n@julianhyde - what do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/508869607/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/508870831","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/8032#issuecomment-508870831","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8032","id":508870831,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwODg3MDgzMQ==","user":{"login":"AlexanderSaydakov","id":13126686,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTI2Njg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13126686?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderSaydakov","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexanderSaydakov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderSaydakov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderSaydakov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderSaydakov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderSaydakov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderSaydakov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderSaydakov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderSaydakov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderSaydakov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderSaydakov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-05T22:06:40Z","updated_at":"2019-07-05T22:06:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"What is the type of the input field \"fieldName\": \"resp_time_his\"?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/508870831/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/508877809","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/7521#issuecomment-508877809","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7521","id":508877809,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwODg3NzgwOQ==","user":{"login":"pdeva","id":3190176,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxOTAxNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3190176?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdeva","html_url":"https://github.com/pdeva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdeva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdeva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdeva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdeva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdeva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdeva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdeva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdeva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdeva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-05T23:11:05Z","updated_at":"2019-07-05T23:11:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"i dont think so. this bug is super easy to reproduce following the steps mentioned though.

did some looking into this and found not just one, but a few different root causes. Here they are, in order of how much they contributed to query planning time (most to least):\r\n\r\n1. Calcite has an O(N^2) OR simplification step in `RexSimplify.simplifyOr`: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-3178. This was the biggest contributor, and a hacky workaround of simply disabling this step cut the planning time down to ~8s.\r\n2. Druid's `Expressions.toSimpleLeafFilter` unconditionally attempts to check every \"leaf\" filter (non-boolean) to see if it's a time floor filter, for purposes of potentially converting `FLOOR(__time TO DAY) = X` into a range filter. This imposes a few seconds of overhead, which could be eliminated by only checking leaf filters that look like they _might_ be time floors (their operator matches `FLOOR`, `TIME_FLOOR`, or `CAST(x AS DATE)`).\r\n3. Druid's `CombineAndSimplifyBounds` builds a `TreeRangeSet<BoundValue>` out of every equality or bound leaf filter, to see if they can be simplified. Algorithmic complexity looks fine from a quick glance at the method, but there is overhead imposed by the fact that `BoundValue.compareTo`, which is called internally and often by the TreeRangeSet, always compares bounds as Strings. For numeric bounds involves a lot of wasteful converting of numbers and strings back and forth. This is only an issue when the bounds are numeric, but, in the case of my test query, they were (it was a long-typed column).\r\n4. Calcite's parser also seems to take a while (1–2s) to read through the SQL. Possibly #6974 would help with that, if it allows constructs like `col IN (?)` where `?` is an array.\r\n\r\nProfiling indicates that if all of the above were addressed, query planning time should come down to more acceptable levels.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/509011366/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/509011444","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/7904#issuecomment-509011444","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7904","id":509011444,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwOTAxMTQ0NA==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-07T16:04:58Z","updated_at":"2019-07-07T16:04:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"By the way, the native query equivalent of my test query runs in about 900ms.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/509011444/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/509016749","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/6948#issuecomment-509016749","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6948","id":509016749,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwOTAxNjc0OQ==","user":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-07T17:23:49Z","updated_at":"2019-07-07T17:23:49Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This pull request has been marked as stale due to 60 days of inactivity.

This can be optionally overridden to support\r\n  incremental size offheap buffers.\r\n   */\r\n  public int getMinimumOffheapSize()\r\n  {\r\n    return getMaxIntermediateSize();\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nand  add `throws MemoryExceededException` to `BufferAggregator.aggregate(ByteBuffer buffer,int position)` method with contract that `MemoryExceededException` can only be thrown if `buffer` provided is of a smaller size than `AggregatorFactory.getMaxIntermediateSize()` and underlying sketch does need more space really.\r\n\r\nWith that druid code using `BufferAggregator` can work as follow...\r\n\r\nstart with a on/off heap `ByteBuffer` or size `AggregatorFactory.getMinimumOffheapSize()` , during aggregation if `MemoryExceededException` is raised then allocate another on/off heap `ByteBuffer` of double the size (optionally `MemoryExceededException` could have a variable telling what is minimum required increased size that `BufferAggregator.aggregate(..)` sets when throwing ex) and call `relocate(int oldPosition, int newPosition, ByteBuffer oldBuffer, ByteBuffer newBuffer)` and then carry aggregation forward.\r\n\r\nnow the question of how sophisticated the MemoryAllocator can or can not be is outside of aggregator implementation. I think it will be \"enough\" to let OS deal with it and use calls to `ByteBuffer.allocate(size)` (in OnHeapIncrementalIndex , use `BufferAggregator` instead of `Aggregator`) and `ByteBuffer.allocateDirect(size)` (in query engines)\r\n(In future, we could still add a MemoryAllocator if we wanted)\r\n\r\nWe track the amount of memory used for these `dynamically sized aggregators` and have configurations to limit amount of memory usage.\r\nFor now, `dynamically sized aggregators` are the ones for which `AggregatorFactory.getMinimumOffheapSize() < AggregatorFactory.getMaxIntermediateSize()` .\r\n\r\nWhen all druid code is updated to handle `dynamically sized aggregators` , we can actually remove `AggregatorFactory.getMaxIntermediateSize()` method altogether and add a `boolean AggregatorFactory.supportsDynamicallySizedAggregation()` and allow `BufferAggregator.aggregate(..)` to throw `MemoryExceededException` at anytime to support cases like `doublesSketch` where there is no known max size really.\r\nWe can probably remove `Aggregator` interface at this point as well.\r\n\r\nso overall we solve two problems...\r\n1) not over-allocate/over-estimate memory\r\n2) support full-on off-heap aggregation for sketches where there is no maximum size e.g. `doubleSketch`\r\n\r\n@gianm does that make sense,  if yes, I will probably extract this into  a separate proposal.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/509415145/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/509446162","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/8041#issuecomment-509446162","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8041","id":509446162,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwOTQ0NjE2Mg==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-09T01:00:27Z","updated_at":"2019-07-09T01:00:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Is
