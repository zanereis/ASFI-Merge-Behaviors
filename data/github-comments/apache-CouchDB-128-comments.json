-DCONFIG_LTO=y -O2 -Iquickjs\"},\r\n+    {\"LDFLAGS\", \"$LDFLAGS -flto -lm quickjs/libquickjs.lto.a\"},\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems to work on macos and debian so far with it.\r\n\r\nI can see `AR?=`, `CC?=` patch for `quickjs/Makefile` being useful in general too but I haven't applied the patch yet. \r\n\r\nI tried this patch to `build_js.escript` but it didn't work as the path where `build_js.escript` runs in a level above `qjsc` so it doesn't find just `qjsc` using `os:cmd` it must be added to the PATH somehow in Yocto?\r\n```diff\r\n-    os:cmd(\"quickjs/qjsc -c -N bytecode -o c_src/\" ++ Tmp ++ \" priv/\" ++ Js),\r\n+    os:cmd(\"qjsc -c -N bytecode -o c_src/\" ++ Tmp ++ \" priv/\" ++ Js),\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile at it I also rebased the QuickJS on the latest master

patch for src/couch_quickjs/rebar.config.script is really handy. And I think it makes sense.\r\n\r\nMost of Yocto Project work is related to fix cross compile build scripts, like the quickjs/Makefile. Sometimes the upstream is not perfect and some patches are needed.\r\n\r\nJust some yocto related details:\r\n\r\nBut, for the couchdb and yocto scenario I had to use a different strategy which was to compile a native quickjs binary using the following recipe https://github.com/meta-erlang/meta-erlang/blob/e1c631d2af795f989f5dca770d8703d923950d93/recipes-extended/quickjs/quickjs_git.bb. Because when I build couchdb, it is a cross compilation for example to ARM and without the quickjs native recipe, I could not run quickjs if it was build by couchdb.\r\n\r\nThat is why I had also to patch the build_js.escript in order to remove the hardcoded quickjs path. In yocto build the quickjs will be available in PATH for couchdb build. I think the build_js.escript is very yocto specific :)\r\n\r\nI'll keep you informed as soon I finish my tests.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/2024182609/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/2024385080","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/4448#issuecomment-2024385080","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/4448","id":2024385080,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmUc54qao4","user":{"login":"nickva","id":211822,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTgyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/211822?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva","html_url":"https://github.com/nickva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-28T04:46:12Z","updated_at":"2024-03-28T04:46:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> That is why I had also to patch the build_js.escript in order to remove the hardcoded quickjs path.

Ronny,\r\n\r\nNidhi works with me, so I know her use case and let explain that to you.\r\n\r\nOurs is a desktop based enterprise application for Windows. The application has a mobile app which uses CouchDB. The entire product is shipped in the form on an installer (.exe). The executable takes care of installing Tomcat, ActiveMQ, MariaDB and CouchDB as Windows services.\r\n\r\n**CouchDB v2.1.0:**\r\nTill now we have been using this version. The way we packaged it with our installer is:\r\n- Install CouchDB using msi installer. Stop the services and zip the installation directory. This was just one time activity.\r\n- Use the zip in all the enterprise installer bundling.\r\n- When the installer is run, identify the open ports and use them in the config properties and run the commands like following to install the CouchDB service -\r\n```\r\n> C:/NS/Production/Mobile/CouchDB/bin/nssm.exe install NS-COUCHDB-5985 C:/NS/Production/Mobile/CouchDB/bin/couchdb.cmd C:/NS/Production/Mobile/CouchDB/bin SERVICE_AUTO_START\r\n> sc start NS-COUCHDB-5985\r\n```\r\n\r\n**CouchDB v3.3.3:**\r\nWe're now upgrading to this version of CouchDB. We tried using the above steps. The service gets installed, but it doesn't start up. So this doesn't work anymore for us.\r\nNext we tried the silent installation. This installs the CouchDB but we're now not in control to **identify and specify the ports** beforehand and **customize the service name**.\r\n\r\nControlling the ports and service name before installation is important to us, because if we don't follow this and there's any deviation in the port consumption or service name, our customers won't be happy.\r\nSo, with v3.3.3, is there any workaround with which we can achieve this?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nSiddhesh Malpani\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/2047612282/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/2047881363","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/5023#issuecomment-2047881363","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/5023","id":2047881363,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmUc56EDCT","user":{"login":"big-r81","id":9985963,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5ODU5NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9985963?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-r81","html_url":"https://github.com/big-r81","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-r81/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-r81/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-r81/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-r81/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-r81/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-r81/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-r81/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-r81/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/big-r81/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-10T15:37:38Z","updated_at":"2024-04-10T15:37:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi Siddhesh,\r\n\r\n> **CouchDB v3.3.3:** We're now upgrading to this version of CouchDB.

Our theory is that when an index is first queried following a v2->v3 upgrade, https://github.com/apache/couchdb/blob/3.3.3/src/couch_mrview/src/couch_mrview_index.erl#L121 will rename the file and return the old signature. however, maybe_update_index_file/1 just renames the file, it does not change its content. https://github.com/apache/couchdb/blob/3.3.3/src/couch_mrview/src/couch_mrview_index.erl#L127 matches and the normal index update path is followed, but if the index is empty then no new content and no new header is written, so the old signature remains in the file. the next time the view is queried, maybe_update_index_file/1 will do nothing (the old file does not exist) and return ok, so we hit this clause where wrong signature appears https://github.com/apache/couchdb/blob/3.3.3/src/couch_mrview/src/couch_mrview_index.erl#L139","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/2048319508/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/2050611974","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/5028#issuecomment-2050611974","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/5028","id":2050611974,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmUc56OdsG","user":{"login":"sht2017","id":29155206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTU1MjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29155206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sht2017","html_url":"https://github.com/sht2017","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sht2017/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sht2017/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sht2017/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sht2017/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sht2017/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sht2017/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sht2017/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sht2017/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sht2017/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-11T21:48:27Z","updated_at":"2024-04-11T21:48:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> Hi,\r\n> \r\n> I think we should not mix things here. The current setup is an administrative installation (exactly a system-wide install) with the possibility to install and run CouchDB as a Windows service (with administrator privileges).

expectation is well-founded, and couchdb does behave that way. So there must be something wrong somewhere. Could it be that the number of in-progress requests keeps climbing? That is, making more and more queries even though previous ones have not yet completed? If so, increased latency on the latter requests is expected due to internal queues. \r\n\r\nI suggest using a tool like ApacheBench to confirm or refute this, set it with some modest concurrency and point it at a view with some appropriate query parameters (i.e, don't read the entire view on each request). \r\n\r\nNote that a view query operates in two phases. the first phase is to ensure the view is up to date with respect to any database updates (by running any new updates through the map and reduce functions). The second phase is the actual query. It will help us to know if the database in question is being written to (and, if so, how intensely) during these queries. e.g, we would expect a view query to take longer if a large number of updates were made to the database just beforehand.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/2090364461/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/2090460806","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/5044#issuecomment-2090460806","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/5044","id":2090460806,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmUc58meaG","user":{"login":"luca-simonetti","id":44196863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTk2ODYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44196863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/luca-simonetti","html_url":"https://github.com/luca-simonetti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luca-simonetti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luca-simonetti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luca-simonetti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luca-simonetti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luca-simonetti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luca-simonetti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luca-simonetti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luca-simonetti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luca-simonetti/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-02T13:08:26Z","updated_at":"2024-05-02T13:08:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for the reply!\r\nI don't think the issue is with queries not being completed, since \r\n\r\na. we do them in series - i.e. we wait for one response before throwing the new query\r\nb. we even have a sleep(.5) after each request before throwing another one.\r\nc. resources -- namely CPU and memory -- are pretty good (like 10% CPU and 10% memory usage)\r\n\r\nfrom an outside point of view looks like there's some kind of _short term memory cache_ which gets bigger and bigger and each query traverses the whole object which gets bigger and bigger all the time.\r\n\r\nfor the record: the requests right after the service restart take somethink like few milliseconds, whereas request after some few thousands get even to 120.000 ms (which is the maximum amount of time for us before calling it a day and raising an exception)\r\n\r\nwe'll try benchmarking with `ab` ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/2090460806/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/2090483998","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/5044#issuecomment-2090483998","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/5044","id":2090483998,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmUc58mkEe","user":{"login":"rnewson","id":47223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson","html_url":"https://github.com/rnewson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-02T13:19:45Z","updated_at":"2024-05-02T13:20:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"there is no cache of query results inside couchdb, for sure.\r\n\r\nIs the database growing during this?
