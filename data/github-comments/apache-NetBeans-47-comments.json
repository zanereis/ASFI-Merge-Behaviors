I'm not very familiar with the clusters system--could you explain how to\n> do this? Is this different from what I started with in the first version of\n> this PR? For that version, @JaroslavTulach\n> <https://github.com/JaroslavTulach> objected that new libraries were\n> ending up in netbeans/platform/lib, which was undesirable. That included\n> libraries that were previously already in the ide cluster (\n> o.apache.commons.io and o.apache.commons.logging).\n>\nThe cluster system actually dates back to Sun's architecture review\nrequirements - but it is a generally good idea.  The idea - driven by\nrequirements from Solaris - was that an application should only install ONE\ncopy of any shared libraries on a system; and Sun was building multiple\nproducts on top of NetBeans.  So if there were two NetBeans-based\napplications on a system, there should only be one copy of, say, the\nplatform modules or the editor modules, which both applications simply use\nas \"clusters\" of libraries.  So the cluster system was invented - carve the\nIDE and platform into chunks of relatied (and interdependent)\nfunctionality, such that inter-cluster dependencies are unidirectional and\nyou - a directed graph.\n\nIn practice, in terms of people installing multiple copies of software on\nsystems, I don't think that is an enormous concern these days (this was\nback in the era of thin-clients, so a \"system\" was likely big iron and the\n\"desktop\" was a remote X connection).  But it forces us to think about both\nmacro-level dependencies - what functionality is and isn't related, what is\n\"essential\" and what isn't, and what is \"platform\" vs. something else, and\nfactor things accordingly.  That keeps a clean definition of what is\n\"platform\" and what isn't, and keeps the IDE and platform from merging into\na monolithic hairball (which it once, circa 1999, was).  So it's a good\nthing to keep.\n\nNow, re SVG icons, that seems to me to be something which obviously belongs\nin the platform.  Display resolution is not going to go *down* and we are\npast the point where raster formats for this sort of thing are inadequate;\nmobile platforms typically have you create raster icons in multiple\nresolutions, which is annoying and goes out of date with the next model;\nand on the desktop, we're not dealing with standardized screen sizes and\nresolutions, so the only sane way to deal that is a resolution-independent\ngraphics format.\n\nSo, this belongs in the platform, period.\n\nIf the objection is that the IDE itself is not yet using SVG icons, so it\nwill result in library dependencies getting packaged which nothing\nuses, *that's\na build-system problem, not an architecture problem.*  Fix the build system\nso the application-building phase detects that there are libraries which\nare not referenced in the manifest of any module or other library, and\ndeletes those.  That's as simple as building a graph of inter-JAR\ndependencies and then seeing if what you actually get is *more than one\ndistinct graph*, and deleting everything that is not in the largest graph\nwhich is the actual application.\n\n-Tim\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/539623163/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/539625631","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/1556#issuecomment-539625631","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/1556","id":539625631,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzOTYyNTYzMQ==","user":{"login":"neilcsmith-net","id":3975960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3975960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net","html_url":"https://github.com/neilcsmith-net","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-08T17:45:18Z","updated_at":"2019-10-08T17:45:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@jlahoda can you clarify what being part of source build but not binary build means?

Maybe it is time to use the backup plan?\r\n\r\nOverall, what I don't like about the way JavaFX is handled is that if I do a build from source, the JavaFX modules are installed already. (These are in the extra cluster, which is I hope not packed in the binary distro, but still.) Not sure if that's technically OK for JavaFX, but I can understand why Jaroslav prefers that for JavaFX - some stuff simply does not work without it. But for javac, I'd *really* prefer if it wasn't installed \"automatically\". I think users should be given a realistic chance to use the javac from JDK, even if they build from source.\r\n\r\nPart of this is that build of e.g. extra/nbjavac.api will not download the nb-javac binary - the intent is to only create an NBM that will download the binary when installed.\r\n\r\nSo, we have a source distro, which includes the 3rdparty cluster, and the nbjavac modules must be part of that in order for them to be part of the distro. But building the source distro will build the 3rdparty cluster as well, and so would include the nbjavac modules, and I think it is preferred to not do that (because we would need to install the external nb-javac library for this to work correctly). So I tried to disable that build, although I agree that's ugly. I would prefer some cleaner solution, but I suspect that will take time (esp. if we try to include JavaFX as well).

However, to be honest, I\ndon't think a unit test makes much sense with this kind of issue.\nThe problem is that the JUnit test case classes are loaded with the regular\nJDK classloaders. JUnit doesn't use the NetBeans class loader system.\nTweaking a ProxyClassLoader into loading the test package-info plus test\nannotation (that's what I did) doesn't really make much sense unless you'd\nchange more code in ProxyClassLoader (creating overridable methods) only\nfor the sake of testing, or you'd have to find a way to prevent JUnit from\nloading a designated package into its classloader at startup.\nBoris\n\nOn Sat, 19 Oct 2019 at 12:18, Matthias Bläsing <notifications@github.com>\nwrote:\n\n> Thank you @borisheithecker <https://github.com/borisheithecker>.
