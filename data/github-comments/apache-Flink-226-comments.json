As we discussed, I agree with your first point. For the second point about RocksDB, this PR already contains an optimized way to deal with incremental local checkpoints that we did not discuss in our review, because I thought it is too much of a low level detail.\r\nIt does not work with duplicating streams. Instead, I introduced a state handle type for a local directory. In fact, I mapped the previous incremental recovery from DFS state also to this new handle type: dfs state is first downloaded and then it also simply becomes a local directory state handle. From there, both incremental recovery paths are identical. The approach also uses complete local checkpoints with hardlinks, as created by RocksDB's native snapshot mechanism.\r\n\r\nFull snapshots, work with duplicated streams.\r\n  ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/356395889/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/356456839","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4150#issuecomment-356456839","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4150","id":356456839,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NjQ1NjgzOQ==","user":{"login":"tzulitai","id":5284370,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODQzNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5284370?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai","html_url":"https://github.com/tzulitai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-10T00:15:26Z","updated_at":"2018-01-10T00:15:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@casidiablo did you mean that without applying this PR's patch, the current master worked for you?

Using `last restored checkpoint ID` to record latest id is not a proper way. Maybe I need to put it in state object. Am I right?\r\n3. A better solution might be tracking all failures in TaskManager, and only report those failure related to restore as restore failure.

Here is a summary of follow-ups from my side:\r\n  - Investigate more if we find a better way for configuration than the `ConfigurableStateBackend`.\r\n  - Adjust some method names.\r\n  - Possible look at a different name for `CheckpointStorage` to avoid confusion with `CompletedCheckpointStore`. We might actually decide to rename `CompletedCheckpointStore` to `CompletedCheckpointsRegistry`, because that is really what it is. ZK registers the completed checkpoints, it does not store them (after this PR that is more true even than before).\r\n\r\nOne of the bigger comments (to replace String by a stronger typed Pointer class) is something I think will not easily work, because Strings is really what we get from the command line, REST interface, ZK. Any extra wrapping would not add any more safety at this point. When we see that we actually can add more safety, we should refactor this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/356696224/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/356746984","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4150#issuecomment-356746984","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4150","id":356746984,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1Njc0Njk4NA==","user":{"login":"xiatao123","id":1026607,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjY2MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1026607?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiatao123","html_url":"https://github.com/xiatao123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiatao123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiatao123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiatao123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiatao123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiatao123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiatao123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiatao123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiatao123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiatao123/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-10T21:45:16Z","updated_at":"2018-01-10T21:45:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Got

I don't ask to type it for the content, but for the usage. I agree that this should just a a string provided by the user, but end-to-end wrapping it until final usage (i.e. from CLI to interpretation to open a file) has advantages:\r\n- If you see the variable, you know what it stands for and it requires no further thinking about what that object could be - you see it immediately or by hovering over it.\r\n- Functions like `xyz(String, String, String)` are strictly worse than `xyz(JobID, OperatorName, StoragePointer)`, you need to think more and can make more mistakes be messing up parameter order. Similar to why we have all the id types and not just use `UUID` everywhere.\r\n- If you search usage of that type, you can easily track all code that deals with storage pointers.\r\n- This type is rarely produced in the system, so memory overhead should not count more than the above points.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/356872196/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/356915553","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/5282#issuecomment-356915553","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/5282","id":356915553,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NjkxNTU1Mw==","user":{"login":"tzulitai","id":5284370,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODQzNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5284370?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai","html_url":"https://github.com/tzulitai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-11T12:06:36Z","updated_at":"2018-01-11T12:07:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"cc @zjureel @aljoscha ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/356915553/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/356917099","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3915#issuecomment-356917099","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3915","id":356917099,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NjkxNzA5OQ==","user":{"login":"tzulitai","id":5284370,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODQzNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5284370?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai","html_url":"https://github.com/tzulitai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-11T12:14:12Z","updated_at":"2018-01-11T12:14:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @zjureel, I went ahead to address my own review / concerns with the change in another PR that is based on your current work: #5282. I hope that is okay, and would be great if you would like to review that.\r\n\r\nThe main changes are:\r\n- We eagerly determine the timestamp offsets. `LATEST`, `EARLIEST`, `GROUP_OFFSETS` startup modes still determines the offsets lazily, while `TIMESTAMP` and `SPECIFIC_OFFSETS` will have actual offsets already before they handled by the `KafkaConsumerThread`. It dawned on me that actually there is no reason to lazily determine the offset for timestamp-based startup, since the actual offset in the end in this case does not vary depending on when we fetch the startup offsets.\r\n- Don't use `Date` to define timestamp, just use Longs. The Kafka APIs actually take long value timestamps, so I figured it would make sense that we follow.

flink-python-streaming to 'libraries' travis profile\r\n\r\nAPI:\r\n- PDS#map()/flat_map() now return PythonSingleOutputStreamOperator\r\n- renamed PDS#print() to PDS#output()\r\n\t- print is a keyword in python and thus not usable in native python APIs\r\n- added PythonSingleOutputStreamOperator#name()\r\n- removed env#execute methods that accepted local execution argument as they are redundant due to environment factory methods\r\n\r\nMoved/Renamed:\r\n- made SerializerMap top-level class and renamed it to AdapterMap\r\n- Moved UtilityFunctions#adapt to AdapterMap class\r\n- renamed UtilityFunctions to InterpreterUtils\r\n- moved PythonobjectInputStream2 to SerializationUtils\r\n- renamed PythonObjectInputStream2 to SerialVersionOverridingPythonObjectInputStream\r\n\r\nFunctions:\r\n- Introduced AbstractPythonUDF class for sharing RichRunction#open()/close() implementations\r\n- PythonOutputSelector now throws FlinkRuntimeException when failing during initialization\r\n- added generic return type to Serializationutils#deserializeObject\r\n- added new serializers for PyBoolean/-Float/-Integer/-Long/-String\r\n- PyObjectSerializer not properly fails when an exceptioin occurs\r\n- improved error printing\r\n\r\n- PythonCollector now typed to Object and properly converts non-PyObjects\r\n- jython functions that use a collector now have Object has output type\r\n\t- otherwise you would get ClassCastException if jython returns something that isn't a PyObject\r\n\r\nPythonStreamBinder\r\n- adjusted to follow PythonPlanBinder structure\r\n- client-like main() exception handling\r\n- replaced Random usage with UUID.randomUIID()\r\n- now loads GlobalConfiguration\r\n- local/distributed tmp dir now configurable\r\n\t- introduced PythonOptions\r\n- no longer generate plan.py but instead import it directly via the PythonInterpreter\r\n\r\nEnvironment:\r\n- Reworked static environment factory methods from PythonStreamExecutionEnvironment into a PythonEnvironmentFactory\r\n- program main() method now accepts a PythonEnvironmentFactory\r\n- directories are now passed properly to the environment instead of using static fields\r\n- removed PythonEnvironmentConfig\r\n\r\nTests:\r\n- removed 'if __name__ == '__main__':' blocks from tests since the condition is never fulfilled\r\n- removed python TestBase class\r\n- removed print statements from tests\r\n- standardized test job names\r\n- cleaned up PythonStreamBinderTest / made it more consistent with PythonPlanBinderTest\r\n- run_all_tests improvements\r\n\t- stop after first failure\r\n\t- print stacktrace on failure\r\n\t- no longer relies on dirname() to get cwd but uses the module file location instead","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/357710237/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/357724310","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/5210#issuecomment-357724310","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/5210","id":357724310,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NzcyNDMxMA==","user":{"login":"xccui","id":1452518,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NTI1MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1452518?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xccui","html_url":"https://github.com/xccui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xccui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xccui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xccui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xccui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xccui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xccui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xccui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xccui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xccui/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-15T16:04:21Z","updated_at":"2018-01-15T16:04:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi

There are pure user-code projects where the Flink runtime is \"provided\" and they are started using an existing Flink setup (`bin/flink run` or REST entry point). This is the **Framework Style**.\r\n\r\n  - In the future, we will have \"Flink as a Library\" deployments, where users add something like `flink-dist` as a library to their program and then simply dockerize that Java application.\r\n\r\n  - Code can be run in the IDE or other similar style embedded forms. This is in some sense also a \"Flink as a Library\" deployment, but with selective (fewer) dependencies. The RocksDB issue applies only to this scenario here.\r\n\r\nTo make this simpler for the users, it would be great to have not N different models that we talk about, but ideally only two: **Framework Style** and **Library Style**. We could for example start to advocate and document that users should always use `flink-dist` as their standard dependency - \"provided\" in the framework style deployment, \"compile\" in the library style deployment. That might be a really easy way to work with that. The only problem for the time being is that `flink-dist` is quite big and contains for example also optional dependencies like `flink-table`, which makes it more heavyweight for quickstarts. Maybe we can accept that as a trade-off for dependency simplicity.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/358002290/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/358220033","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4552#issuecomment-358220033","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4552","id":358220033,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1ODIyMDAzMw==","user":{"login":"zhijiangW","id":12387855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzg3ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12387855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW","html_url":"https://github.com/zhijiangW","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-17T07:27:44Z","updated_at":"2018-01-17T07:27:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@NicoK , I have submitted the switch for keeping the old mode and the new credit-based mode.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/358220033/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
