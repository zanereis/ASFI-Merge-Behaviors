believe I have a solution to your problem, and it's very simple.\r\n\r\nHOWEVER: I highly recommend not to do this, but to encrypt the passwords to the new `argon2` format\r\nYou just need to add `passwordService.setHashFormat(new Shiro1CryptFormat());` to your code\r\n\r\nFull example:\r\n```\r\npublic class EncryptTest {\r\n    @Test\r\n    void encryptPassword() {\r\n        DefaultPasswordService passwordService = new DefaultPasswordService();\r\n        passwordService.setHashService(new HS());\r\n        passwordService.setHashFormat(new Shiro1CryptFormat());\r\n        System.out.println(passwordService.encryptPassword(\"hello123\"));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private final static class HS extends DefaultHashService {\r\n        HS() {\r\n

Yes you can run any of our recipes through https://app.moderne.io/marketplace, which is free for OSS.\r\nYou'll likely want to create a user organization for Shiro via de selector in the top left corner, and then select Shiro\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/shiro/assets/1027334/104eddfe-d8e5-41a4-9077-c9bc2df46800)\r\n\r\nOr you can select the existing Open Source organization we already have for Apache, Maven, Gradle and others.\r\n\r\nFrom there you can go to our marketplace to select and run recipes; I like looking over [our best practice recipes](https://app.moderne.io/search?q=best%20practices). Here's the typical list of [recipes to run when first starting out](https://docs.moderne.io/administrator-documentation/moderne-platform/getting-started/proof-of-value#recipes-to-run). All of those should complete in about a minute for Shiro, and from there you can then create PRs as I did here.\r\n\r\nSome recipes also come with dedicated visualizations, which we're wrapping up into a dashboard of insights and fixes to announce coming week. I'll share a link when the blog is out! :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/comments/1974745243/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/comments/1974747390","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shiro/pull/1338#issuecomment-1974747390","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/1338","id":1974747390,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAARy8s51tED-","user":{"login":"timtebeek","id":1027334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjczMzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1027334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timtebeek","html_url":"https://github.com/timtebeek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timtebeek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timtebeek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timtebeek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timtebeek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timtebeek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timtebeek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timtebeek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timtebeek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timtebeek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-02T09:39:15Z","updated_at":"2024-03-02T09:39:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"As an example of what you could do next, I see you're right now using assertj for one single test:\r\nhttps://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aapache%2Fshiro%20assertj&type=code\r\n\r\nIf you were to want to switch over to AssertJ we have a recipe that should do most of the work for you:\r\nhttps://app.moderne.io/recipes/org.openrewrite.java.testing.assertj.Assertj\r\n\r\nIf not, then it's maybe best to phase out that single use to prevent a long period of dual use or slow adoption.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/comments/1974747390/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/comments/1974800859","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shiro/pull/1338#issuecomment-1974800859","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/1338","id":1974800859,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAARy8s51tRHb","user":{"login":"bmarwell","id":1413391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTMzOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1413391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmarwell","html_url":"https://github.com/bmarwell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmarwell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmarwell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmarwell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmarwell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmarwell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmarwell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmarwell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmarwell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmarwell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-02T13:46:02Z","updated_at":"2024-03-02T13:46:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ha, yes.

@fpapon for your considerations \r\n\r\nThe perspective of this conceptual example is intriguing and prompts us to reflect on session management and authentication/authorization in stateful applications. When we choose to store authentication/authorization data in the session, the session management mechanism, such as Shiro, naturally assumes control over this state. In this context, a JWT token merely as a transporter of credentials, eliminating the need for revalidation once the session is authenticated because the session has the capability to maintain this state, including management of timeout, invalidation, and more. However, in scenarios where the session holds states not related to authentication/authorization, revalidating the JWT Token on each request through a filter would logically make sense. This approach depends on each use case, but fundamentally, it seems sensible to me. For stateless applications, Shiro offers mechanisms like the filter'NoSessionCreationFilter', which naturally facilitate token verification on every request, a practice common in REST APIs.\r\n\r\nDoes that make sense?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/comments/1988263034/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/comments/1988289135","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues/1344#issuecomment-1988289135","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/1344","id":1988289135,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAARy8s52guJv","user":{"login":"fpapon","id":6915443,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MTU0NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6915443?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpapon","html_url":"https://github.com/fpapon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpapon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpapon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpapon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpapon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpapon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpapon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpapon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpapon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpapon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-11T12:06:07Z","updated_at":"2024-03-11T12:06:07Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Exactly, it's depend on the use case, you can also have a mix between session and JWTs expired validation but for stateless api, using session doesn't not make sense.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/comments/1988289135/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/comments/1988344546","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues/1344#issuecomment-1988344546","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/1344","id":1988344546,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAARy8s52g7ri","user":{"login":"haikalrios","id":1226771,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjY3NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1226771?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haikalrios","html_url":"https://github.com/haikalrios","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haikalrios/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haikalrios/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haikalrios/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haikalrios/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haikalrios/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haikalrios/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haikalrios/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haikalrios/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haikalrios/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-11T12:37:15Z","updated_at":"2024-03-11T12:37:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Exactly, that's the point .
