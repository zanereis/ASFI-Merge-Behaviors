@nuclearpinguin @mik-laj @potiuk \r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think of a deprecation warning if this hook is called with services where we already have a dedicated hook? So that users can then change to the dedicated hook if it has the functionality he needs.\r\n**OR**\r\nWhat if it dynamically changes to the dedicated hook's function if exists.\r\nSo for example: \r\nYou call `GoogleDiscoveryApiHook.query(endpoint='bigtableadmin.projects.instances.get')` and it actually calls `BigtableHook.get_instance`. This would require a mapping between api endpoint and gcp hook function that we then probably need to manually update every time we add a new gcp (dedicated) hook.\r\n\r\nThe second one is probably too _complex_.\r\n\r\n_and in the end we are about to mix the client-based and discovery based api - what we probably don't want.

I love it. \r\n\r\nIt's a huge change though and it will have a lot of conflicts with #5786 so we have to think carefully which one to merge first (I believe it will be easier to have isort re-run after the pylint changes).\r\n\r\nI do not think we need explicitly state the instructions about isort in documentation as long as we add sorting script as another pre-commit check. We already have several pre-commit checks that modify the sources (for example the licence checks). \r\n\r\nPre-commit works in the way that if it modifies any of the files while running - the whole pre-commit fails and it asks the user to add/commit the modified files. Also if someone does not use pre-commits (yet!) the checks fail in CI because some files were modified.  Then in CI there is a very clear instruction \"please run pre-commit and then add/commit changed files\". I think it's better than comprehensive documentation because if travis fails you simply get instructions what to do :). And with properly implemented pre-commit check it will be super-easy to run by anyone even if they don't have pre-commits installed as git hooks. They would simply need to run 'pre-commit run sort--imports' if we add it with this id.\r\n\r\nI can help with adding it if needed :). With isort I think we do not even need docker image to run - you can simply specify isort as additional_dependencies as ['isort']  of python pre-commit hook and add isort configuration and specify the isort command to execute (see https://pre-commit.com/#pre-commit-configyaml---hooks) .  In such case pre-commit will automatically create virtualenv, add isort as dependency and run the command specified (and if it won't modify any of the files it will be automatically \"passed\"). \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/526833755/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/526874310","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5770#issuecomment-526874310","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5770","id":526874310,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNjg3NDMxMA==","user":{"login":"steven-freed","id":39471055,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDcxMDU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39471055?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/steven-freed","html_url":"https://github.com/steven-freed","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steven-freed/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steven-freed/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steven-freed/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steven-freed/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steven-freed/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steven-freed/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steven-freed/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steven-freed/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steven-freed/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-01T00:05:09Z","updated_at":"2019-09-01T00:05:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Can you point me in the right direction of writing tests with GCP?
