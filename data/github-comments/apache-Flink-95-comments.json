The optimizer's design does not allow to modify operators in or inject operators into enumerated subplans. This might cause invalid execution plans and in worst case wrong results without somebody noticing it.\n\nI would simply log a WARN message that a combiner was not added if the optimizer identifies a Partition operator in front of a Reduce or combinable GroupReduce operator and give a hint that an explicit CombinerFunction can be added with groupCombine in front of the partition operator.\n\nSorry again @ramkrish86 that I lead you into a dead end with this

Is there an advantage in having an `Iterator` with this extension? I see to possible solutions: \n1. the easy one: having two methods, one materializing the `Iterator` into a collection and another one accessing the items one a time: the only issue with this would be the need to have to methods with distinct names (otherwise we would be back to square one); this means the user can use the case-style functions to destructure the collection or each item separately; otherwise we can\n2. adopt a slightly more sophisticated solution: wrap the `Iterator` in a `Stream`, which is lazy but also fully destructurable in case-style functions (e.g.: using the `#::` operator). This would require some work as the `Iterator` is stateful with regards of the traversal while the `Stream` is not and we can't just use a naive solution or the semantic difference could lead to some nasty bugs in user code.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/199837531/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/199839220","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1826#issuecomment-199839220","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1826","id":199839220,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5OTgzOTIyMA==","user":{"login":"dalegaard","id":344673,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDY3Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/344673?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dalegaard","html_url":"https://github.com/dalegaard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dalegaard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dalegaard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dalegaard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dalegaard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dalegaard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dalegaard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dalegaard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dalegaard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dalegaard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-22T14:28:51Z","updated_at":"2016-03-22T14:28:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Travis appears to have failed on one of the five targets because of a flaky YARN test case.
