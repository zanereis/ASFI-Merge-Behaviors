What I understand is that larger learning rate indicates more aggressive search for a good solution.\n\nAfter changing ReLU from tanh, mlp.py gives validation accuracy of 97.87%.\n\nSorry for my unfamiliarity with python resulting in my questions about updating mxnet.

I have successfully trained an MLP with my own data.\n\nI noticed that when using numpy.ndarray as input, the validation set is not used. I tried myself but it reported error. To be specific, I have tried two ways. One is\n\n```\nmodel.fit(X=train_data, y=train_label, eval_data=(val_data, val_label))\n```\n\nThis results in the error of \"too many values to unpack\" (line 325 in model.py). I checked the model.py and googled for a while. Then I tried the other way.\n\n```\nval_set = [(v, c) for v, c in zip(val_data, val_label)]\nmodel.fit(X=train_data, y=train_label, eval_data=val_set)\n```\n\nBut it results in the error of \"invalid index to scalar variable\" (line 328 in model.py). It seems to be that the unpacked `label` is a scalar so the index `islice` is not applicable.\n\nSo what is the right way to use numpy.ndarray for the `eval_data` argument?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/144909212/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/144917680","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/201#issuecomment-144917680","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/201","id":144917680,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NDkxNzY4MA==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-02T04:45:48Z","updated_at":"2015-10-02T04:45:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for contribution!
