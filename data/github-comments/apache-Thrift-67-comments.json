So I'll fix that.\r\n\r\nRegarding prefixing, the way JavaScript introduces standardised symbols is that they use `Symbol(\"...\")` (globally unique) instead of `Symbol.for(\"...\")` (equal to any other `Symbol.for(\"...\")` where `\"...\"` is equal).\r\n\r\n`Symbol.iterator` or `Symbol.asyncIterator` are examples of that. You categorically cannot construct these symbols yourself. So while somebody may create a symbol that is equal to `Symbol.for(\"read\")` it will never be a problem. I'd liken it to somebody subclassing a Java thrift class and overriding the `.read` method vs not being able to do that. Possibly useful to be able to override the method for testing purposes, but not in any other case.\r\n\r\nSecurity-wise I'd argue that symbols are a teeny tiny bit safer than strings as you cannot deserialise a value into a symbol with any of the thrift serialisers or even JSON. But there's no real difference. Symbols are essentially just a different class of strings that can be globally unique if you use `Symbol(\"...\")` instead of `Symbol.for(\"...\")`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/2266152453/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/2268394810","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/3010#issuecomment-2268394810","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/3010","id":2268394810,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAS9U86HNPU6","user":{"login":"mrcjkb","id":12857160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODU3MTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12857160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrcjkb","html_url":"https://github.com/mrcjkb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrcjkb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrcjkb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrcjkb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrcjkb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrcjkb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrcjkb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrcjkb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrcjkb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrcjkb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-05T07:45:05Z","updated_at":"2024-08-05T07:45:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks
