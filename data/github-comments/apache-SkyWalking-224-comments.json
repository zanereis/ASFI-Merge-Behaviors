Could it be that your environment somehow loads an old version of Node.js even though you have a newer version installed?\r\n\r\nIf you in your code try to run console.log('Running Node.js version:', process.version), does it still output version 10?\r\n\r\nAre you trying to use it with webpack? That looks like the error you get when trying to bundle Node.js code that uses non-browser-compatible code without explicitly telling webpack to allow it.
