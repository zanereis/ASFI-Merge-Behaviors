Since \r\n\r\n- our users usually use zeppelin with R, python not with java only\r\n- it's easy to maintain\r\n\r\nI would like to use ubuntu which is comfortable as a desktop OS instead of alpine\r\n\r\n- alpine is not designed for rending images. It throws some errors when you draw charts using R, python.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? @felixcheung @jongyoul @bzz ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/271554811/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/271562076","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1825#issuecomment-271562076","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1825","id":271562076,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MTU2MjA3Ng==","user":{"login":"AhyoungRyu","id":10060731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYwNzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10060731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu","html_url":"https://github.com/AhyoungRyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-10T12:21:53Z","updated_at":"2017-01-10T12:21:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @minahlee!\r\nWill merge if there are no more comments on this.
