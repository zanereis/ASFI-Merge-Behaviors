I think it worth discussing the approach a bit further. Given that the relay operators are already accessible as part of the API, and the HLO and relay are pretty close, perhaps we want to statr by directly translate the HLO to relay in c++ without introducing the additional relay dialect step. The translation from MLIR/HLO to relay is going to be quite close to translation from a relay dialect to relay.\r\n\r\nThis will help to reduce the number of places that are required to define a new operator. Given that the relay's operator set is growing. It will also likely makes the control flow and recursion translation more streamlined. \r\n\r\nA transition to a relay dialect(if we decided to) should not be too hard later, in that case we should also start to think more about a formal operator spec description, so we can generate the tablegen def later if necessary.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/740757459/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/740762641","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/7052#issuecomment-740762641","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7052","id":740762641,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0MDc2MjY0MQ==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-08T16:59:44Z","updated_at":"2020-12-08T16:59:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Please open a new thread on https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/.

We're depending on the nomially cuda topi kernels for a lot of other GPUs, so this trend makes it harder to support more diverse hardware.\r\n\r\n@mbrookhart @zhiics While I fully agree with this generally, for fundamental, low level GPU primitives such as sorting, scan etc, I think it would be really hard for generic implementations to match or outperform platform specific libraries. These libraries have years of development behind it and use platform specific intrinsics to maximize performance. This also applies to cuDNN, but unlike convolution op, I don't think AutoTVM or Ansor would help generate efficient sort or scan ops.\r\n\r\nSooner or later, I think we will introduce `cumsum` op to TVM. On CUDA, `cumsum` can be implemented very efficiently via thrust or cub's `inclusive_scan`. But without it, we have to roll our own GPU scan implementation that can compete with vender-provided one, which I think would be a formidable or near impossible task.\r\n\r\nSo my opinion is, while native TVM solution is always what we should strive for, if there is a platform specific library, we should embrace it. Sort, scan etc are standard enough that there is a good chance platform specific library is available. For example, rocm has their implementation of thrust, on OpenCL there is Boost.compute.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/740919507/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/741006719","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7056#issuecomment-741006719","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7056","id":741006719,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0MTAwNjcxOQ==","user":{"login":"mbrookhart","id":4065489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNjU0ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4065489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart","html_url":"https://github.com/mbrookhart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-08T20:48:46Z","updated_at":"2020-12-08T20:48:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think I agree with you, @masahi, my only disagreement is the level at which we are currently implementing things.

Thanks for the comment. \r\n\r\nWe chose to go with MLIR/HLO instead of XLA HLO, because HLO operations works on tensors with static shape (dynamic ops like [NMS](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/42879) are not supported by XLA HLO), this limits op/model coverage. MLIR/HLO is possible to represent dynamism, for example, the mhlo lowered from MLIR/TensorFlow. \r\n\r\nIntroducing Relay Dialect does bring some extra effort for adding relay operators, and translation from MLIR/HLO to Relay is pretty similar to translation from MLIR/Relay to Relay. \r\n\r\nConsidering several dialects are defined already, like [MLIR/TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/compiler/mlir/tensorflow/ir) (NMS is in it now), [MLIR/TFLite](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/compiler/mlir/lite), [MLIR/HLO](https://github.com/tensorflow/mlir-hlo), [MLIR/ONNX](https://github.com/onnx/onnx-mlir/), etc. Having Relay Dialect will make the conversion from other potential MLIR Dialects to Relay(via mlir/relay) easy, writing some mlir passes/patterns will make the conversion between dialects happen under MLIR conversion infra. Besides, folks might translate relay to mlir/relay even though personally I don't think we need do this.\r\n\r\nIf we believe/bet there are translations from other mlir dialects to relay in the future, I think having relay dialect is not a bad thing. I am okay to go with mlir/hlo to relay directly. Please let me know what you guys think. \r\n\r\ncc: @yangjunpro @jroesch @yidawang @zhiics ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/741706021/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/741716260","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6900#issuecomment-741716260","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6900","id":741716260,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0MTcxNjI2MA==","user":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-09T11:37:10Z","updated_at":"2020-12-09T11:37:10Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@t-vi Please have a look at the CI issue.

The main discussion pt is how can we get to that point.\r\n\r\nRight now we have the need to expose relay operators to a few places: (1) python  (2) c++ registration; (3) rust; (4) tablegen(if go with the mlir route). Adding new point of exposure would indeed creates the complexity of adding a new relay operator.\r\n\r\nIf we can first streamline the operator schema itself (perhaps relates to the object def schema https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/rfc-tvm-object-schema-dsl/7930), then there will be less resistance in adding a MLIR relay dialect later. \r\n\r\nRight now, a direct translation might be a path of less resistance, given that: (1) We can always switch to a dialect later and most of the code are similar; (2) It would be easier to quickly expand the support. (3) We might need some effort in figuring out the control flow support/effect translation first, then think about how a complete dialect can be built. \r\n\r\nAdding support translation from other MLIR dialects is not hard, as most of them shares the same graph structure, but will indeed benefit from a dialect. The main complexity though may not be on the op translation part, but on the translation of types, control flow and effect. So it would be nice to streamline these parts starting from a path of less resistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/741822077/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/741841901","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7060#issuecomment-741841901","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7060","id":741841901,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0MTg0MTkwMQ==","user":{"login":"FrozenGene","id":7287321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyODczMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7287321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene","html_url":"https://github.com/FrozenGene","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-09T15:23:30Z","updated_at":"2020-12-09T15:23:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I agree TQ @tqchen ’s point. we introduce this pr’s main goal is to cover more models (include dynamic).

Adding Relay as a dialect would benefit more other dialects including other projects internally. But it does introduce another layer of transition for TVM. \r\n\r\nSince converting through MLIR/HLO to Relay shares almost the same amount of efforts, we can probably go this route first. We could either add relay as a dialect later after op schema is done as @tqchen mentioned or go through a dialect to MLIR/HLO then to Relay first if it is needed. As of now, we probably don't need many dialects to Relay, i.e. we have direct parsers from onnx/TFLite to Relay.\r\n\r\nIf you agree, let's discuss offline to setup the CI so that you can move

yeah, I agree that GraphDef protocol buffer definition just changed a little, creating a new parser will end up with some redundant work (copy from the existing parser). I tried to run the test cases in your shared branch, I found the existing parser works for most of the TF 2.x ops (previously I assume we have to modify most of the mapping in the parser). we can just update the existing parser for TF2.x, and remove unnecessary part in the future once we stop supporting 1.x support. \r\n\r\nPlease rebase your work, it would be good to have it work on top of TF 2.4(latest version is 2.4.0rc4). We can work on variable and tensorlist related ops at the same time.

Overall looks pretty good, but I am a little confused at exactly what is happening is this pass. Is it converting matrices from sparse to dense at compile time?\r\n> \r\n> Thanks @tkonolige for review! The Densify Op does not need to be present in TVM runtime currently, because its purpose is to convert sparse weights(constant) to dense form. So i have optimized it out. However in case it is required in future to be present in TVM runtime, we can always do it with sparse_to_dense Op with the indices produced from the utility prepare_dense_matrix_from_sparse().\r\n> \r\nSorry about the delay in reviewing .  \r\n\r\nI think there are a couple of design points here that we should consider and take a well-informed decision on this direction. \r\n\r\n1. The advantage of keeping the sparse weights representation all the way through is something that helps with keeping the weights size low in the final binary generated which could help with static size / footprint in the final binary at the expense of some runtime (obviously). For usecases where we go through this with BYOC or others where there are weight compression techniques, this should clear up reasonably ok, however where we fall back to traditional tvm compilation on CPUs and GPUs there's no weight compression techniques and thus this contributes to rodata bloat or flash bloat. \r\n\r\n2. Even if it doesn't make sense to keep this in the final representation to be expanded at the runtime either in the form of an op for the Relay VM or a new op in the graph runtime - is this operator something that appears in other frameworks and if so does it make sense to keep this behaviour common across the stack to allow us to reuse this logic for other frontends as well i.e. the various frontends lower to a relay.op.densify () and the result of that is something that represents a dense weight tensor. Further legalization could end up creating this dense weight tensor ? One of the principles in compiler design is to try and bind things as late as possible to give us a chance of optimizing and being able to recover easily without too much reverse engineering. So this comes back to that as well. \r\n\r\nTBH I would probably prefer #2 as an approach to try and reduce any duplications in the frontends and give other compilers or others who use Relay a chance to get to the densify op. I don't think we can use it for any of our work instantly. If the performance or code size becomes an issue we'll need to reconsider a runtime or partial runtime representation of sparse weights at which point #1 would be a stepping stone towards it .\r\n\r\nThese are my thought on the design. \r\n\r\nregards\r\nRamana\r\n\r\n> As to your other comments i have tried to add comments in the necessary places. Please have a look. In case anything more required. Please let me know.

ACL does not support tuples, so AnnotateTarget should not mark them as supported. We shouldn't need a 'fix-up' pass after AnnotateTarget to make it correct, it's just a bug in AnnotateTarget that's come about from faulty reasoning about how codegens work. As this is user-facing and a critical error, I think the priority is accepting a fix with a refactor to reduce complexity coming later.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/742539127/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/742608360","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7080#issuecomment-742608360","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7080","id":742608360,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0MjYwODM2MA==","user":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-10T15:53:40Z","updated_at":"2020-12-10T15:53:40Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@corehalt I dont think we need to introduce a new file, please add your change to qnn_test.py","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/742608360/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
