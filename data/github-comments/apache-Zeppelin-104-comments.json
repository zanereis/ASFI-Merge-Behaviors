Use just reflection\n- Pros: We can have only 1 interpreter `ElasticsearchInterpreter` \n- Cons: but too much reflection code :( \n\n#### 2.

For example, `ElasticsearchInterpeterBase`\n\n# Final Thought\n- Refactor the whole `ElasticsearchInterpreter` to extract abstract class which can be shared by 2.x, 5.x\n- Write 2.x, 5.x interpreters

Let me update and will ping you again.\n```\n1. Is the comment above is how it works now? Meaning, does on the first run of `./bin/zeppelin-deamon.sh` or `./bin/zeppelin.sh` a download of Apache Spark (100+Mb) happen, without asking a user?\n2. does this also mean that on CI it will happen on every run of SeleniumTests as well?\n3. `-Ppyspark` disappeared, but I remember it was added because we need to re-pack some files from Apache Spark to incorporate them in Zeppelin build in order for it to work on a cluster. Is it not the case any more? For Spark standalone and YARN, etc\n\nThanks in advance!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/259331986/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/259332168","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/932#issuecomment-259332168","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/932","id":259332168,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1OTMzMjE2OA==","user":{"login":"bzz","id":5582506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1ODI1MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5582506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz","html_url":"https://github.com/bzz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-09T04:34:37Z","updated_at":"2016-11-09T04:34:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@echarles I'm terribly sorry for for such a huge communication delay in my side :\\\n\nWould you be willing to re-base it on the latest master so we could merge it?

Yeah I also wanted to get more and more feedbacks for this change since it's a huge change as you said. Thanks for asking and i'm willing to explain again :)\n\n> **1.**  Is the comment above is how it works now? Meaning, does on the first run of ./bin/zeppelin-deamon.sh or ./bin/zeppelin.sh a download of Apache Spark (100+Mb) happen, without asking a user?\n\nFirst time, I intended to ask sth like \"Do you want to download local Spark?\" when user starts Zeppelin daemon. But there are lot's of things to think about more since this question will be added before Zeppelin server start. e.g. [Some ppl are using Zeppelin as a start up service](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1339#issuecomment-250672904) with their script as @jongyoul said. This kind of interactive mode will bother their env. \nSo I decided to download this local Spark with `./bin/zeppelin-daemon.sh get-spark` or `./bin/zeppelin.sh get-spark`. With `get-spark` option, users don't need to be asked and they can choose whether they download this local mode Spark or not. Also they can use this local Spark without any configuration aka `zero configuration`. But we need to notice them the existence of `get-spark` option. That's why I updated documentation pages to let them know. \n\n> **2.** does this also mean that on CI it will happen on every run of SeleniumTests as well?\n\nThis change won't effect to CI build. I added `./bin/download-spark.sh` to download Spark only when the user run `./bin/zeppelin-daemon.sh get-spark`.  \n\n> **3.** -Ppyspark disappeared, but I remember it was added because we need to re-pack some files from Apache Spark to incorporate them in Zeppelin build in order for it to work on a cluster. Is it not the case any more? For Spark standalone and YARN, etc\n\n`pyspark` profile only exists in `spark-dependency` (Please see [here](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/spark-dependencies/pom.xml#L820)). Since `spark-dependencies` won't be existed anymore, `-Ppyspark` needs to be removed accordingly I guess.

and worked as expected 😄\n\nFantastic work! But, there are other benefits caused by this change.\n\nBefore this change, users couldn't use `SPARK_SUBMIT_OPTIONS` env variable using embedded Spark. (am i right?)\n\nBut now it's  possible! I tested with `export SPARK_SUBMIT_OPTIONS=\"--driver-memory 4G\"` and on Spark UI, I could check It works.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8201019/20149088/128d4bc4-a6f3-11e6-9990-705040e04a59.png)\n\nTherefore, I think it would be better to update `conf/zeppelin-env.sh`. There is a comment which is:\n\n``` sh\n## Use provided spark installation ##\n## defining SPARK_HOME makes Zeppelin run spark interpreter process using spark-submit\n##\n# export SPARK_HOME                             # (required) When it is defined, load it instead of Zeppelin embedded Spark libraries\n# export SPARK_SUBMIT_OPTIONS                   # (optional) extra options to pass to spark submit. eg) \"--driver-memory 512M --executor-memory 1G\".\n# export SPARK_APP_NAME                         # (optional) The name of spark application.\n\n## Use embedded spark binaries ##\n## without SPARK_HOME defined, Zeppelin still able to run spark interpreter process using embedded spark binaries.\n## however, it is not encouraged when you can define SPARK_HOME\n##\n```\n\nThis should be updated properly. In my opinion, it doesn't need to encourage use external spark anymore :-)\n\nAnd, is it possible to use embedded spark without `get-spark`? If not, I think it should be written on README clearly.\n\nLGTM

Duplicated code in `executeDeleteQuery` is due to incompatible API between 2.x and 5.x\n\n```\n// 2.x\npublic boolean isFound() { ... } \n// 5.x\nRestStatus.NOT_FOUND != response.status())\n```\n\nBut we can extract duplicated validation logic to the base class as you mentioned.\n\n### 2. @bzz, @bbonnin  Regarding to update docs,\n\nAre there more files I should update? I am asking because \n- new maven profiles are added `elasticsearch-2` (activated by default), `elasticsearch-5`\n- `elasticsearch-5` profile requires java 8 +\n\n### 3. The final hurdle is,\n- Figure out how to replace `setExtraSource` (https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21452)\n\n> Hi @1ambda, wrapper query should work for the query part of the search request. Can you post more info on how it doesn't work for you please? Unfortunately I don't think we have the same for aggregations and the rest of a search request.\n> In general, I'd recommend to use the java api builders to create search requests that are already in the binary format, so no parsing is needed. Otherwise, I would suggest to have a look at the newly released Java REST client that doesn't have builders yet but allows to provide strings.\n\n**We need REST API client**\n- Enhance test cases for agg, search. They only checks `InterpreterResult.Success` not the response currently\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/259600496/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/259608789","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1510#issuecomment-259608789","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1510","id":259608789,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1OTYwODc4OQ==","user":{"login":"snaveenp","id":11040545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDQwNTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11040545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/snaveenp","html_url":"https://github.com/snaveenp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snaveenp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snaveenp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snaveenp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snaveenp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snaveenp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snaveenp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snaveenp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snaveenp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snaveenp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-10T06:03:36Z","updated_at":"2016-11-10T06:03:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"my jira id is naveenimaginea\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/259608789/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/259610655","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1594#issuecomment-259610655","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1594","id":259610655,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1OTYxMDY1NQ==","user":{"login":"1ambda","id":4968473,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Njg0NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4968473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda","html_url":"https://github.com/1ambda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-10T06:19:00Z","updated_at":"2016-11-10T08:53:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"resolve merge conflict with 777.\n\nNow CI is failing on `Server` :(  I will close and re-open this issue to trigger CI\n\n```\nINFO] Zeppelin: web Application ..........................

Thanks!).\nBut as always, this kind of big change brings downside as well (e.g. breaking current UX). So I wanna write down how we can address some major cases as below. I think it would be better to share my opinion and get more feedback before merging. :)\n1. New Spark/Zeppelin user, running Zeppelin for the first time\n   : Quite easy to cover and already handled by updating the related docs pages I guess.\n2. Existing Spark/Zeppelin user, running new Zeppelin installation (e.g. upgrading version)\n   :  Definitely this case is harder to handle than 1. As the user already has expectation, that local mode will **just works** and surely they won't read the docs. To resolve this, I’ll update `bin/download-spark.sh` to print sth like “You don’t have local-spark/, you can download embedded Spark with `get-spark` option.” When the user run  `./bin/zeppelin-daemon.sh start`. And this sentences can be removed in the future when Zeppelin users can be getting accustomed with `get-spark` option.\n3. Docker user, starting `bin/zeppelin.sh` inside the container\n   : This one can be also hard to handle because the user might assume that Spark just works. So I would suggest start applying this change to #1538 as a first step. Since it can be a Zeppelin-provided official docker script.\n4. CI issue\n   Since @bzz raised some concern about CI issue, let me answer again in here to make sure :)\n   The reason I removed `-Ppyspark` in `.travis` is `pyspark` profile is only existed in `spark-dependencies/pom.xml`. So `pyspark` profile won’t be anymore after this PR merged. Actually the Pyspark testcase that @astroshim added recently had some conflict with this change. But we solved by simply adding `export SPARK_HOME=`pwd`/spark-$SPARK_VER-bin-hadoop$HADOOP_VER` to `.travis.yml` so that travis can run it before running the script. So there are no more CI issues especially concerning about removing `spark-dependencies` related build profiles.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/259683752/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/259690489","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1619#issuecomment-259690489","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1619","id":259690489,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1OTY5MDQ4OQ==","user":{"login":"khalidhuseynov","id":1642088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDIwODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1642088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov","html_url":"https://github.com/khalidhuseynov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-10T13:32:11Z","updated_at":"2016-11-10T13:32:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"CI is green. /cc @prabhjyotsingh for help reviewing as contributed to it before.
