Can you point me to them? I tested manually e2e and deployed this change already to our dev env and will deploy to production tomorrow. And yes, the subdag run is created by the SubdagOperator and runs properly.\r\n\r\nBut I'm ok with splitting it up this PR. Then I'd suggest to revert #3460 for 1.10, and then create a separate PR for passing conf from the main dag to the subdag.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/400823169/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/400825109","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3393#issuecomment-400825109","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3393","id":400825109,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMDgyNTEwOQ==","user":{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-27T20:52:16Z","updated_at":"2018-06-27T20:52:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Nice looks great!

If it should check for the exact path, then the used approach of using ls and filtering doesn't make sense to me, as there can only be a single result. If it checks for a pattern (using glob for example), then I don't understand the need for the regex sensor, as most patterns should be checkable via globs. Similarly, the sensor folder could be replaced by a glob checking for files in directory, with an optional complement argument if we need an empty directory. \r\n\r\nBesides this, the subclasses duplicate most of the code used in the base class for checking file existence. A good way to avoid this would be to allow users to supply an arbitrary function (or list of functions) for filtering down potential file paths. This may however break the current interface.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/401379258/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/401386460","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3504#issuecomment-401386460","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3504","id":401386460,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMTM4NjQ2MA==","user":{"login":"OElesin","id":11349090,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQ5MDkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11349090?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OElesin","html_url":"https://github.com/OElesin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OElesin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OElesin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OElesin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OElesin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OElesin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OElesin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OElesin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OElesin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OElesin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-29T15:18:47Z","updated_at":"2018-06-29T15:18:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Fokko,

This makes for a more flexible approach for filtering potential hits than the current subclassing approach. Filtering for size unfortunately requires the filter functions to have access to the hdfs_conn, which is not ideal.\r\n\r\nBeside this, I added a `deprecated_args` decorator which supports handling renamed/removed arguments with the appropriate deprecation warnings. This may be useful for supporting argument renames in future code, if the changes in this PR are approved.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, I think I would drop the `HdfsSensorRegex` and `HdfsSensorFolder` classes from contrib. Most of the regex cases should now be covered by  the HdfsHook by using globbing to match file path patterns. Similarly, the `HdfsSensorFolder` sensor can be simulated by either checking for the folder directly (case for be_empty = False) or checking for any files in the directory (using a glob pattern) and negating the result (functionality we could add with a `complement` parameter).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/401469104/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/401485703","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3563#issuecomment-401485703","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3563","id":401485703,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMTQ4NTcwMw==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-29T22:05:35Z","updated_at":"2018-07-07T09:32:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/3563?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#3563](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/3563?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/commit/32db62ed0c71533bfa20980bee1858c0b6c96b05?src=pr&el=desc) will **increase** coverage by `0.03%`.\n> The diff coverage is `16.66%`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/3563/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&height=150&token=WdLKlKHOAU&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/3563?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@            Coverage Diff             @@\n##           master    #3563      +/-   ##\n==========================================\n+ Coverage   76.83%   76.87%   +0.03%     \n==========================================\n  Files         204      204              \n  Lines       15492    15481      -11     \n==========================================\n- Hits        11904    11901       -3     \n+ Misses       3588     3580       -8\n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/3563?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [airflow/security/utils.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/3563/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9zZWN1cml0eS91dGlscy5weQ==) | `29.62% <16.66%> (+0.68%)` | :arrow_up: |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/3563?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/3563?src=pr&el=footer).
