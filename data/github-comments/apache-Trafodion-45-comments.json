@traflm for checking it out.  Currently, Trafodion needs 32 MB of locked memory per node. When you issue ipcs, you would see two segments with 32 MB  locked because there are  2 virtual nodes in developer environment . Trafodion product might lock RMS shared segment in future. RMS shared segment default is 64MB with a provision to expand upto 128MB.  So Trafodion requires  320MB of locked shared memory at most.\n\nI believe ulimit -l is the user level limit. So, it would be good if we report an error when it is less than 64 MB and report an warning if it is less than 320MB.  Reporting warning for 40GB of locked memory per user is way too high.\n\nIn case of max user process, it would be good if we report an error if /proc/sys/kernel/pid_max is set to higher value than 65535 and possibly ignore ulimit -u settings\n\nCan  32000 for ulimit -n be considered reasonable? This is per process limit.  I guess there will be resource/performance implications with altering these numbers.  I don't have definite answer.\n\nI am not sure about ulimit -i pending signals.\n\nHowever in summary, my suggestion is that sqstart should throw a warning or an error only when it is clear what Trafodion needs.  I would think this might need to be fixed in installer too. Otherwise, Trafodion might end up giving false indications to the customer to configure such settings.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/234053152/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/234076858","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/604#issuecomment-234076858","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/604","id":234076858,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNDA3Njg1OA==","user":{"login":"narendragoyal","id":12994681,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTk0Njgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12994681?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendragoyal","html_url":"https://github.com/narendragoyal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendragoyal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendragoyal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendragoyal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendragoyal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendragoyal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendragoyal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendragoyal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendragoyal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendragoyal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-20T20:45:21Z","updated_at":"2016-07-20T20:45:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks good to me.
