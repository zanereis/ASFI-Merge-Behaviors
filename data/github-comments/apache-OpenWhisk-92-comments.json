,\r\n\r\nRunning this harness on a OpenWhisk deployment running on a native Ubuntu system runs into failures.\r\nThe noopLatency action is created and can be invoked via \"wsk cli\" but in the latency

Note that we are trying to handle the max scenario. So there could be 1M/second events happening through lot of devices which will then come to a openwhisk cluster, which will handle all of them. It is not clear at this point what different types of events would we have and how much processing for each type is required. there could be event that needs to be just transferred to kafka and further to internal database. Others might have some processing to do.\r\n\r\nSo do you thing depending upon the system power and memory it is possible to setup an openwhisk cluster that can handle 1M/sec events?

it is key though, that you are able to override limits in an environment, which is why the `defaultLimits` are global and `limits` are \"local\". I agree the existing scheme isn't perfect, in fact it is quite wrong with the recent changes now.\r\n\r\nWhat we should do:\r\n1. Remove `defaultLimits`, have only `limits`\r\n2. Make each key in `limits` overridable, such as\r\n\r\n```\r\nlimits:\r\n  invocationsPerMinute: \"{{ limit_invocations_per_minute | default(120) }}\"\r\n  concurrentInvocations: \"{{ limit_invocations_concurrent | default(100) }}\"\r\n  concurrentInvocationsSystem:  \"{{ limit_invocations_concurrent_system | default(5000) }}\"\r\n  firesPerMinute: \"{{ limit_fires_per_minute | default(60) }}\"\r\n  sequenceLength: \"{{ limit_sequence_length | default(50) }}\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat is: It adjusts the wording to conform with the `UserLimits` class. It also allows selective overriding per environment (by defining one of the `limit_...` variables), but keeps defaults up top.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/321205615/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/321206497","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/2590#issuecomment-321206497","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/2590","id":321206497,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMTIwNjQ5Nw==","user":{"login":"misl","id":2040396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDAzOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2040396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/misl","html_url":"https://github.com/misl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-09T09:40:01Z","updated_at":"2017-08-09T09:40:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Having the option to control the entrypoint name allows me to have multiple entrypoints in the same class.
