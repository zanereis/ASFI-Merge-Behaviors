started looking into it, but man this is one big change... 😃 \n\nI have some first remarks about API and internals:\n\nWhats the reason for the introduction of `PartitionedState`? The Javadoc for `State` already says that it is the base class for partitioned state and that it is only usable on a `KeyedStream`.\n\nThe signature of `KeyGroupedStateBackend` and `PartitionedStateBackend` is exactly the same. `AbstractStateBackend` has both, method `createPartitionedStateBackend` and `createKeyGroupStateBackend`. Users of an `AbstractStateBackend` should only ever call the latter while the former is reserved for internal use by the default implementation for `KeyGroupedStateBackend` which is `GenericKeyGroupStateBackend`. Also, `AbstractStreamOperator` has the new method `getKeyGroupStateBackend` that should be used by operators such as the `WindowOperator` to deal with partitioned state. Now, where am I going with this? What I think is that the `AbstractStateBackend` should only have a method `createPartitionedStateBackend` that is externally visible. This would be used by the `AbstractStreamOperator` to create a state backend and users of the interface, i.e. `WindowOperator` would also deal just with `PartitionedStateBackend`, which they get from `AbstractStreamOperator.getPartitionedStateBackend`. The fact that there are these key groups should not be visible to users of a state backend. Internally, state backends would use the `GenericKeyGroupStateBackend`, they could provide an interface to it for creating non-key-grouped backends.\n\nAbove, \"exactly the same\" is not 100 % correct, since the snapshot/restore methods differ slightly but I think this could be worked around. Also, I found it quite hard to express what I actually mean but I hope you get my point. 😅 \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/221289448/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/221307901","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1981#issuecomment-221307901","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1981","id":221307901,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMTMwNzkwMQ==","user":{"login":"dawidwys","id":6242259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNDIyNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6242259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys","html_url":"https://github.com/dawidwys","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-24T15:26:46Z","updated_at":"2016-05-24T15:26:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@fhueske I have uploaded the updated PR.

The idea was that we will have partitioned and non-partitioned state in the future. `PartitionedState` is the key-value state backed by the `PartitionedStateBackend` whereas non-partitioned state is backed by the `AbstractStateBackend`. The first non-partitioned state (apart from the state serialized via `CheckpointStateOutputStream`) could be the redistributable non-partitioned state necessary for the `KafkaSources`, for example. Thus, the `PartitionedState` is more of a logical separation and it lays the foundation so that also non-keyed stream operators can use a proper state abstraction. But I can revert it, if you deem it redundant or pre-mature.\n\nIt is true that the `PartitionedStateBackend` and the `KeyGroupStateBackend` have **almost** the same signature. However, the changes you've mentioned are imho crucial and made the whole refactoring of the state backends necessary in the first place. The difference is that the `KeyGroupStateBackend` is aware of the key groups and, consequently, is able to snapshot and restore each key group individually. Trying to work around this would mean that the `PartitionedStateBackend` always has a single key group associated. But for that, it would have to know the sub task index of the enclosing `StreamOperator` to assign a sensible key group index. Furthermore, it wouldn't make sense to use any other `PartitionedStateBackend` than the `KeyGroupStateBackend` (given that it respects the `KeyGroupAssigner`) for the `AbstractStreamOperator`, because the data is shuffled according to the key group assignments. In general, I think the notion of key groups are touching too many parts of the Flink runtime so that it makes no longer sense to try to unify the `KeyGroupStateBackends` and `PartitionedStateBackends`. The state backends used by the `AbstractStreamOperator` have to be aware of that notion.\n\nYou can regard the `PartitionedStateBackend` as an internal class which was introduced to reuse the existing state backend implementations via the `GenericKeyGroupStateBackend`. In the future it might make sense to directly implement the `KeyGroupStateBackend` interface to decrease the key group overhead. It's just unfortunate that Java does not allow to specify package private methods. Otherwise, I would have declared the `createPartitionedStateBackend` as package private. But since the `GenericKeyGroupStateBackend` resides in a sub-package of `o.a.f.runtime.state`, it cannot access this method. But I think we could refactor it the following way: Remove `createPartitionedStateBackend`, make `createKeyGroupStateBackend` abstract, let the implementations of `AbstractStateBackend` implement a `PartitionedStateBackendFactory` interface and define the `createKeyGroupStateBackend` method for all `AbstractStateBackend` implementations with creating a `GenericKeyGroupStateBackend` which requires a `PartitionedStateBackendFactory`. That would be probably a better design.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/221309557/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/221311349","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1988#issuecomment-221311349","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1988","id":221311349,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMTMxMTM0OQ==","user":{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-24T15:37:10Z","updated_at":"2016-05-24T15:37:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Jip, this last paragraph with the Factory is what I hinted at with my comment. 😃 This may be somewhat academic but if there is a method `getPartitionedStateBackend` the likelihood of it being wrongly used is somewhat high.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/221311349/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/221312885","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1988#issuecomment-221312885","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1988","id":221312885,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMTMxMjg4NQ==","user":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-24T15:41:47Z","updated_at":"2016-05-24T15:41:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yes definitely: better be safe than sorry.

It also increases the time that the build takes, for every build.\n\nI think a good start would be to increase the timeout to 5000 (a bit more stability), and then actually improve the test and the iterations themselves:\n- The test case could be modified to actually run the program with a large iteration timeout. But the program is started in a separate thread, and the main thread checks for the result periodically (every 50ms or so) and cancels the program as soon as the expected result is there. That way, the test will return fast if the execution is fast, and will still be pretty reliable, because the termination has a long timeout.\n- We should change the stream iteration behavior from a timeout-based termination to a proper \"end-of-stream-event\" based termination. That would also automatically make the test reliable and predictable. This is a bit more involved, but would be the best solution. I'd be happy to write more about that in a design doc, if you want to do that.\n\nPlease let us know if you would be up for helping out with these efforts!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/221853220/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/221856876","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2027#issuecomment-221856876","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2027","id":221856876,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMTg1Njg3Ng==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-26T12:27:23Z","updated_at":"2016-05-26T12:27:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for looking into this!\nI think that increasing the test timeout will not solve the problem.

The `parseFieldImpl` is a way to force this thing, otherwise you should rely on classes using such parser to remember this thing (as you suggested with \"GenericCsvInputCormat would call the resetErrorStateAndParse\") or ensure that every parser call it at the very beginning of the `parseField()`.\n  I'm really concerned about this.

All NullValues are always the same. They are all equal, hash to a constant value, etc.\n- We were trying to get rid of the `Record` type - it was part of a very old legacy API. It is still in there because some people ended up using it, but I would like to add as little dependency to it as possible.

I wonder what's your motivation to implement a flink --> rethinkdb connector?

Therefore, I suggest that you put the code into a separate github repository and open a pull request to add a link to that repository.\nThe good thing about this approach is also, that we don't have to fix the license issue immediately.\nAlso, it doesn't mean that I'm against this contribution at all. If we see many users using the module from your github repository, and there are people in the community willing to maintain it, we can also look into merging it.\n\n[1] http://flink.apache.org/contribute-code.html#before-you-start-coding\n[2] http://flink.apache.org/community.html#third-party-packages\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/221886697/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/221890183","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1990#issuecomment-221890183","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1990","id":221890183,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMTg5MDE4Mw==","user":{"login":"gna-phetsarath","id":1582011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODIwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1582011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gna-phetsarath","html_url":"https://github.com/gna-phetsarath","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gna-phetsarath/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gna-phetsarath/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gna-phetsarath/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gna-phetsarath/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gna-phetsarath/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gna-phetsarath/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gna-phetsarath/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gna-phetsarath/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gna-phetsarath/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-26T14:38:51Z","updated_at":"2016-05-27T14:53:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"You are correct, the majority of the changes were in the \"generate splits\" method and \"statistics\" methods which included changes to subclasses that used the file path directly.

I will try to answer your questions below:\n\nRegarding motivation for the connector - I started working with Flink late last year and found it had some unique features (like streaming framework based on events from the grounds up and flexibility of windowing options).  I am working through some real-time data flow use cases, where these capabilities can stream line our processing pipelines. The integration with RethinkDB came into play because from the dev perspective it is schema less, can ingest streams/batch of data, has map/reduce functionality.  From the ops/scaling perspective it can be scaled/re-sharded in real-time without downtime. It can also provide change streams for a table, or a document.  IMHO, Flink and Rethink complement each other for scalable, stream processing/analytics use cases.  So, I thought it might be good to contribute back to the open source community and therefore the PR.\n\nRegarding guidelines for code-contribution - I did go through the document and I thought this PR would be in the same vein as the other streaming connectors (kafka, etc), and complementing them.  There was no new API, or change in interfaces, and the code base is pretty light weight because Flink/RethinkDB both make it natural to integrate.  However, I did not realize that it would be considered to a new feature and required a design review but perhaps that was my oversight.  \n\nRegarding the license issue - I can work on the 2nd java driver (with the Apache License) if you have concerns about the 1st driver's license. \n\nIn any case, I really appreciate, the time you and your team took to review the PR and advice me.  Please let me know what's your recommendation on how I should proceed.\n\nThanks, Mans\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/222030024/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/222111542","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2016#issuecomment-222111542","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2016","id":222111542,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMjExMTU0Mg==","user":{"login":"aozturk","id":980594,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MDU5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/980594?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aozturk","html_url":"https://github.com/aozturk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aozturk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aozturk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aozturk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aozturk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aozturk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aozturk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aozturk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aozturk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aozturk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-27T10:16:30Z","updated_at":"2016-05-27T10:16:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Pushed updates according to your comments.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/222111542/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/222113016","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2037#issuecomment-222113016","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2037","id":222113016,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMjExMzAxNg==","user":{"login":"mxm","id":837221,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNzIyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/837221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm","html_url":"https://github.com/mxm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-27T10:24:29Z","updated_at":"2016-05-27T10:24:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Rebased to the latest master.
