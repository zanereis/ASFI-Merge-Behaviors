@markobean Thanks for the PR! Utilizing the extra real estate of the Configuration dialog is a great idea. I have a couple of suggestions:\r\n> \r\n> <img alt=\"Screenshot 2023-09-13 at 2 59 50 PM\" width=\"1666\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56892372/267799683-1a894a71-ea68-4d53-be24-e0c0d48814c1.png\">\r\n> * Now that we have more than one column, the `Apply Recursively` checkbox looks out of place. Furthermore, if the browser width reduces, then the checkbox and label get pushed into the Parameter Context menu. I suggest moving the checkbox and label to the right of the `Apply` button and change the label to: `Apply Parameter Context recursively`, to be more clear of the action.\r\n> \r\n> <img alt=\"Screenshot 2023-09-13 at 3 00 04 PM\" width=\"495\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56892372/267800273-613bd567-c257-4cd2-b30d-6c395e352792.png\">\r\n> * Since we have still have a good amount of empty space remaining in the General tab, I suggest to remove the Comments tab and add the Comments `textarea` as a third column in the General tab. This way we can also keep the `Apply` click action in one place.\r\n> \r\n> Thoughts?\r\n\r\nThanks for the feedback @mtien-apache! I am away for the next 10 days, but will get to this when I return.\r\n\r\nAs far as the comments tab, I like it being separate to be consistent with other components. It also leaves room for growth for the main General tab. It has seen the addition of numerous properties, and I feel this may continue over time.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMark","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1721421829/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1721428888","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/7591#issuecomment-1721428888","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/7591","id":1721428888,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5mmuuY","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-15T15:03:17Z","updated_at":"2023-09-15T15:03:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> As far as the comments tab, I like it being separate to be consistent with other components.

On the Processor configuration dialog, the Apply button is always visible, making it clear that it applies to all tabs. With the current approach, the button is not always visible. I could see separating the Comments field into its own tab, but only if we also relocate the Apply button.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1721428888/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1721457475","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/7733#issuecomment-1721457475","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/7733","id":1721457475,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5mm1tD","user":{"login":"joewitt","id":3057465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTc0NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3057465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt","html_url":"https://github.com/joewitt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-15T15:22:27Z","updated_at":"2023-09-15T15:22:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I pushed up a couple more minor changes/squashed and forced.

Are you going to switch from gremlin-groovy to gremlin-java? What is the impact for things like [Janusgraph](https://docs.janusgraph.org/) that only appear to support Gremlin as the query language?\r\n\r\n@mattyb149 to answer this it really depends on what is going to happen to the other scripted processors that use groovy. Do you have any guidance on what that will look like for nifi as a whole? \r\n\r\nIn my opinion, depending on the guidance, moving away from groovy will have minimal impact on this. For the scripted version of this processor, there is no groovy dependency. For the bytecode version, I have been running a custom build of this processor for ~ 3 years, which leverages java-gremlin to load data into janusgraph. As long as I have a way to inject the graph traversal source, it shouldent really matter if the underlying code is compiled groovy or a set of standardized methods on a custom jar. \r\n\r\nHow we do that will just depend on what nifi is doing with the other groovy-injected processors such as: https://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/main/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-groovyx-bundle/nifi-groovyx-processors/src/main/java/org/apache/nifi/processors/groovyx/ExecuteGroovyScript.java ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1721841706/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1721851927","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/7677#issuecomment-1721851927","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/7677","id":1721851927,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5moWAX","user":{"login":"joewitt","id":3057465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTc0NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3057465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt","html_url":"https://github.com/joewitt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-15T20:51:14Z","updated_at":"2023-09-15T20:51:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The move to Groovy 4.0.15 is in main now so you can probably rebase and try again","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1721851927/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1721935253","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/7739#issuecomment-1721935253","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/7739","id":1721935253,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5moqWV","user":{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-15T22:15:27Z","updated_at":"2023-09-15T22:15:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @joewitt!

Disabling on Windows seems sufficient for this one test method.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1726393780/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1726403205","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/7752#issuecomment-1726403205","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/7752","id":1726403205,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5m5tKF","user":{"login":"dan-s1","id":8440116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NDAxMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8440116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1","html_url":"https://github.com/dan-s1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-19T20:11:17Z","updated_at":"2023-09-19T20:11:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Another option mentioned in the ticket involves not using the `TempDir `annotation and instead using\r\n\r\n```\r\nprivate static Path tempDir;\r\n\r\n    @BeforeAll\r\n    public static void before() throws IOException {\r\n        tempDir = Files.createTempDirectory(null);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @AfterAll\r\n    public static void after() {\r\n        tempDir.toFile().delete();\r\n    }\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1726403205/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1726416373","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/7566#issuecomment-1726416373","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/7566","id":1726416373,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5m5wX1","user":{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-19T20:23:04Z","updated_at":"2023-09-19T20:23:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @joewitt seems reasonable.

The consumer client creates 20 `aws-java-sdk-NettyEventLoop-1-*` threads. Not sure we need that many, furthermore these threads remain alive when the processor is stopped. Could you please check if the thread count can be configurable and how to stop these threads?\r\n\r\nIt looks like the thread count is configurable, via the following code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nNettyNioAsyncHttpClient.builder()\r\n            .eventLoopGroupBuilder(SdkEventLoopGroup.builder()\r\n            .numberOfThreads(MAX_EVENT_LOOP_GROUP_THREADS))\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, when I do this, it seems to spawn a new event loop group every time I stop/start a processor, and also for each new ConsumeKinesisStream processor I create, regardless of whether I cache the `SdkClient`.  On the other hand, when I leave the default `NettyNioAsyncHttpClient` builder in place, I get a constant 24 threads regardless of starting/stopping and adding new processors.  As it is, I'm inclined to leave the configuration as is, and perhaps this could be a future improvement if we can determine how to properly set the event loop group thread count.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> When I stop the consume processor I get the following error:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> 2023-07-31 23:04:40,056 ERROR [prefetch-cache-shardId-000000000000-0000] s.a.k.r.polling.PrefetchRecordsPublisher turcsanyi-stream:shardId-000000000000 :  Unexpected exception was thrown. This could probably be an issue or a bug. Please search for the exception/error online to check what is going on. If the issue persists or is a recurring problem, feel free to open an issue on, https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client.\r\n> java.lang.IllegalStateException: Shutdown has been called on the cache, can't accept new requests.\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> Do you see the same?\r\n\r\nYes, unfortunately this appears to be an open issue in the client: https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/issues/914\r\n\r\n> \r\n> Not related to this change: `AbstractAwsProcessor` has `client` and `region` fields but the `awsClientCache` is used instead.

I guess the client cache solution was ported from there.\r\n\r\nDone, good catch.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1730281684/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1730287735","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/7529#issuecomment-1730287735","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/7529","id":1730287735,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5nIhh3","user":{"login":"gresockj","id":423565,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMzU2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/423565?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gresockj","html_url":"https://github.com/gresockj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gresockj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gresockj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gresockj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gresockj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gresockj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gresockj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gresockj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gresockj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gresockj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-21T20:53:41Z","updated_at":"2023-09-21T20:53:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"\r\n> I will take another look at the integration tests.
