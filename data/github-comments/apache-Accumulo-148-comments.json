When data is null means that data was never fetched, which could be the case when only the children were fetched.\r\n\r\nI have run into problems w/ this test before where its mocking of zookeeper does not follow the behavior of zookeeper.  When asking for data for a node that does not exist in zookeeper it will throw a NoNodeException and not return null.  Made the following changes to add the non null check back and make the test throw NoNodeException instead of return null.  Also one test expected synconnected to clear the cache, so had to change that.  The syncconnected test may be wrong in prev versions of Accumulo and maybe that is masked by the incorrect mocking behavior.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/core/src/main/java/org/apache/accumulo/core/zookeeper/ZcNode.java b/core/src/main/java/org/apache/accumulo/core/zookeeper/ZcNode.java\r\nindex 741f905b26..d1f75ae4b8 100644\r\n--- a/core/src/main/java/org/apache/accumulo/core/zookeeper/ZcNode.java\r\n+++ b/core/src/main/java/org/apache/accumulo/core/zookeeper/ZcNode.java\r\n@@ -83,7 +83,7 @@ class ZcNode {\r\n    * stat.\r\n    */\r\n   ZcNode(byte[] data, ZcStat zstat, ZcNode existing) {\r\n-    this.data = data;\r\n+    this.data = Objects.requireNonNull(data);\r\n     this.stat = Objects.requireNonNull(zstat);\r\n     if (existing == null) {\r\n       this.children = null;\r\ndiff --git a/core/src/test/java/org/apache/accumulo/core/zookeeper/ZooCacheTest.java b/core/src/test/java/org/apache/accumulo/core/zookeeper/ZooCacheTest.java\r\nindex 02484b1692..6dd4e2dcc2 100644\r\n--- a/core/src/test/java/org/apache/accumulo/core/zookeeper/ZooCacheTest.java\r\n+++ b/core/src/test/java/org/apache/accumulo/core/zookeeper/ZooCacheTest.java\r\n@@ -263,7 +263,7 @@ public class ZooCacheTest {\r\n \r\n   @Test\r\n   public void testWatchDataNode_NoneSyncConnected() throws Exception {\r\n-    testWatchDataNode(null, Watcher.Event.EventType.None, false);\r\n+    testWatchDataNode(null, Watcher.Event.EventType.None, true);\r\n   }\r\n \r\n   private void testWatchDataNode(byte[] initialData, Watcher.Event.EventType eventType,\r\n@@ -285,11 +285,11 @@ public class ZooCacheTest {\r\n     if (initialData != null) {\r\n       expect(zk.getData(ZPATH, null, existsStat)).andReturn(initialData);\r\n     } else {\r\n-      expect(zk.getData(ZPATH, null, existsStat)).andReturn(null);\r\n+      expect(zk.getData(ZPATH, null, existsStat)).andThrow(new KeeperException.NoNodeException(ZPATH));\r\n     }\r\n     replay(zk);\r\n     zc.get(ZPATH);\r\n-    assertEquals(initialData != null, zc.dataCached(ZPATH));\r\n+    assertTrue(zc.dataCached(ZPATH));\r\n   }\r\n \r\n   @Test\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI will look at the ephemeral thing and see if I know anything.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/2613410890/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/2614044877","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/5284#issuecomment-2614044877","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/5284","id":2614044877,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM6bzyjN","user":{"login":"cshannon","id":123009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzAwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon","html_url":"https://github.com/cshannon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-25T17:46:34Z","updated_at":"2025-01-25T17:46:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@keith-turner - I had a couple follow up questions/thoughts on the changes here:\r\n\r\n1. I believe most of the code assumes the `TabletMergeability` column always exists, but I'm not sure if we should be handling it missing. I don't recall if we talked about adding it on upgrade or not if not set.\r\n2. Should we allow setting a negative delay? A negative delay is confusing but would have the side effect of allowing a tablet to merge for a period of time (say the next 2 days) and then wouldn't allow it after that. I don't know that there is a use case for that but it could be supported because we are using an explicit \"never\" flag for the metadata and in the RPC calls so \"never\" isn't tied to -1 or a negative delay.\r\n3. Do you have any ideas on how to better test the API for retrieving `TabletMergeabilityInfo` on errors? The logic will retry splits if there are errors but I couldn't think of a great way to test it, at least with integration tests. Maybe we need something with mocking.\r\n4. I used a supplier to delay retrieving the current system time (it's shared across all the tablets that are part of the getTabletInformation() query) in case the information isn't required and to delay the current time until as late as possible and then it will be cached. We could get rid of this and just compute it and set it on retrieval.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/2614044877/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/2614046182","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/5284#issuecomment-2614046182","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/5284","id":2614046182,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM6bzy3m","user":{"login":"cshannon","id":123009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzAwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon","html_url":"https://github.com/cshannon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-25T17:51:10Z","updated_at":"2025-01-25T17:59:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm

into how this could be done and came up with one possible way that seems like it could break into two PRs.  First could modify FateStore to remove the following method.\n\n```java\n  Optional<FateId> seedTransaction(Fate.FateOperation txName, FateKey fateKey, Repo<T> repo,\n      boolean autoCleanUp);\n```\n\nand replace it with the following\n\n```java\n  interface Seeder<T> extends AutoCloseable {\n    // For UserFateStore this would create a conditional mutation and add it to the conditional writer\n    void attemptToSeedTransaction(Fate.FateOperation txName, FateKey fateKey, Repo<T> repo,\n                    boolean autoCleanUp);\n    // This would check the status of all added conditional mutations, retry unknown, and then close the conditional writer.\n    void close();\n  }\n\n  // Creates a conditional writer for the user fate store.  For Zookeeper all this code will probably do the same thing its currently doing as zookeeper does not support multi-node operations.\n  public Seeder<T> beginSeeding();\n```\n\n\nThe current code in the manager could be left as is to be changed in a second PR.  The way that code is structured it only knows about a single thing to seed at a time, so it would go through the three step process with a single thing and have the same behavior until the second PR is done.\n\nIn a second PR the manager code could be modified from adding single task to a thread pool to instead add task to a queue and have a single background thread that takes batches of task of the thread pool and uses the new fate store API to write them all at once. There are a few different way this could be done.

Could mark everything as never at upgrade since we do not know. In the past when things were not resolved at upgrade and conditional logic was left in the code for old versions of Accumulo it caused really hard to test tech debt to accumulate.\r\n\r\nOk that makes sense, I went back and looked at my last PR and one thing I did do was [set](https://github.com/apache/accumulo/blob/a156308c82ddef3f3716d569f85a4aac482875d6/core/src/main/java/org/apache/accumulo/core/metadata/schema/TabletMetadata.java#L705) the default in the TabletMetadata builder to NEVER which is the same pattern that TabletAvailability [uses](https://github.com/apache/accumulo/blob/a156308c82ddef3f3716d569f85a4aac482875d6/core/src/main/java/org/apache/accumulo/core/metadata/schema/TabletMetadata.java#L698) (sets to ONDEMAND).

The logic will retry splits if there are errors but I couldn't think of a great way to test it, at least with integration tests. Maybe we need something with mocking.\r\n> \r\n> Its probabilistic, but could create 10 threads that each add 100 splits to a table. Each thread adds some splits that are unique to it and some that are common to all threads. This should cause colllisions and retries in the code. After all the threads are done should be able to see an expected set of splits and mergabilites.\r\n> \r\nThat is a good idea I'll see what I can come up with for a test.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/2614488519/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/2616389257","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/5281#issuecomment-2616389257","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/5281","id":2616389257,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM6b8u6J","user":{"login":"dlmarion","id":567911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NzkxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/567911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion","html_url":"https://github.com/dlmarion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-27T17:07:00Z","updated_at":"2025-01-27T17:07:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks like the merge to main caused a compilation error in ClientContext.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/2616389257/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/2616580313","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/5286#issuecomment-2616580313","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/5286","id":2616580313,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM6b9djZ","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-27T18:26:09Z","updated_at":"2025-01-27T18:26:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Opened this as a draft because I want to redo this after #5256 is merged.

Another good resource for understanding it is [here](https://www.apachecon.com/acna2022/slides/02_Thakur_Hadoop_Vectored_IO.pdf). I attempted to use this, but was unable to figure out a good way to use it as we don't directly deal with HDFS blocks. Instead, we deal with RFile blocks, and we cache them, at a much different layer than where the HDFS block is retrieved.\r\n\r\nInstead I attempted to create something similar in this PR, prefetching RFile blocks and preemptively caching them. I think this might make sense for operations that perform sequential reads, like compactions. So I wired this up in the FileCompactor for major compactions, and I targeted the main branch because major compactions only run in Compactors. In earlier releases this change would cause churn in the data block cache and might cause a decrease in scan performance due to eviction of other blocks.\r\n\r\nThere are still some changes to be made, like adding the BlockCache to the Compactor, making the number of blocks to prefetch a property, and moving the ThreadPoolExecutor out of the Reader and somewhere else. But wanted to get early feedback on the concept before putting more work into it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/2634908149/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/2636785822","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/5205#issuecomment-2636785822","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/5205","id":2636785822,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM6dKiie","user":{"login":"Suvrat1629","id":140749446,"node_id":"U_kgDOCGOqhg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/140749446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Suvrat1629","html_url":"https://github.com/Suvrat1629","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Suvrat1629/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Suvrat1629/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Suvrat1629/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Suvrat1629/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Suvrat1629/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Suvrat1629/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Suvrat1629/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Suvrat1629/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Suvrat1629/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-05T12:56:21Z","updated_at":"2025-02-05T12:56:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Could I work on this issue?
