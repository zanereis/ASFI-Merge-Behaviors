 For your interest - there is a new Bucketing Sink in the Flink master (called `StreamingFileSink`), with a different design: Managing all state in Flink state (so it is consistent), with a new File System writer abstraction to generalize across HDFS, POSIX, and S3 (S3 still WIP) and with a more pluggable way to add encoders, like parquet and orc.\r\n\r\nAs an example, we added a Parquet writer, which is quite straightforward and flexible with the new interface.\r\n\r\nWould be great to get your opinion on that and see if your ORC writer code also works with that.\r\nIf it works out, the new

For this PR, I just want to push as soon as possible, because it is mid-night in China, so did not check carefully, sorry for that. Now, it has been updated, please review it again.\r\nActually, I have contributed to table module recently and implemented five functions, they are `fromBase64`, `toBase64`, `log2(x)`, `ascii`, `chr`.\r\n`ascii` and `chr(char)` is a pair functions in many RDBMS to exchange ASCII code and character(string).\r\n The purpose is I want to enhance Flink table/sql's functions. I know there are some functions more important, I will try to implement them in the future.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/408164654/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/408169883","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6390#issuecomment-408169883","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6390","id":408169883,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwODE2OTg4Mw==","user":{"login":"yanghua","id":2283778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODM3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2283778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua","html_url":"https://github.com/yanghua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-26T17:17:02Z","updated_at":"2018-07-26T17:17:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@xccui thanks for your suggestion, fixed them~","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/408169883/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/408274936","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6336#issuecomment-408274936","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6336","id":408274936,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwODI3NDkzNg==","user":{"login":"ubyyj","id":12639959,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjM5OTU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12639959?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubyyj","html_url":"https://github.com/ubyyj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubyyj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubyyj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubyyj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubyyj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubyyj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubyyj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubyyj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubyyj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubyyj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-27T00:27:23Z","updated_at":"2018-07-27T00:27:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@tillrohrmann @zentol would you please take a look, and if everything looks good to you, can you please get this merged?
