Hi @weizihan0110 , thanks a lot for pointing out this issue.\r\n> \r\n> Actually, we have `InternalMNode` at the beginning of the design (and that's why it appeared in the design document).\r\n> \r\n> Afterwards, after `Allow SubDevices in IoTDB` function is supported (in PR #1323), we noticed that all types of `MNode` extend `InternalMNode`, which extends `MNode`. Therefore, we refactored `MNode` by removing `InternalMNode` and including all its methods.\r\n> \r\n> Here is the related PR: #1345. You could see the `InternalMNode.java` is totally deleted.\r\n> \r\n> However, we only considered \"sub-devices\" at that time, without considering creating parent node. So this decision may be reverted. What do you think? Would you like to try and implement the function that you need?\r\n\r\nHi, @samperson1997 , I have submitted a related PR at [ISSUE-2484] Fix creating timeseries error by using \"create\" or \"insert\" statement #2468. Could you have a review for it?\r\n\r\nAfter merging the #2468 PR, I will try to introduce internalMNode to replace implementing MNode type directly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/768006870/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/768007133","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iotdb/pull/2589#issuecomment-768007133","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/2589","id":768007133,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2ODAwNzEzMw==","user":{"login":"sonarqubecloud[bot]","id":39514782,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mzk1MTQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/12526?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/sonarqubecloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-27T04:00:59Z","updated_at":"2021-01-27T04:00:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Kudos,

I was saying adding `.*` to the paths is not necessarily a bug, as it may be needed in data queries. You should either convince me by showing that this change does not affect related data queries or allow `show device` and other queries to ignore the last `.*`.\r\n\r\nMaybe i can fix it in show devices by ignoring the last .*., but there is another question \r\nbefore ignoring the last .*., when i execute show devices root.a.b.* ,the result is  root.a.b.c,\r\nafter ignoring the last .*., execute the same sql ,it will match root.a.b and root.a.b.c,\r\n result is inconsistent.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/768871939/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/768873175","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iotdb/pull/2567#issuecomment-768873175","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/2567","id":768873175,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2ODg3MzE3NQ==","user":{"login":"sonarqubecloud[bot]","id":39514782,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mzk1MTQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/12526?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/sonarqubecloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-28T08:01:12Z","updated_at":"2021-01-28T08:01:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Kudos,

Hi, @weizihan0110 , could you write some design doc on the mailing list or on the confluence?\r\n> It will be very good to let new guys know your idea and understand the codes.\r\n> e.g., what is a `AlterTimeSeriesBasicInfoPlan` used for and is not used for? How it works.\r\n\r\nOf course. I'll finish it as soon as possible. \r\nAnd how can I upload the doc on the confluence?\r\n@jixuan1989

In this case, the read-only mode cannot be enabled.\r\n\r\nBecause\r\n1. If you cannot determine whether the code is specified by the user, the data can be inserted in the sequence of timestamp data.\r\n2. If such data is inserted, the error tolerance capability is required.\r\n(2.1) Modify the data.\r\n(2.2) Delete the data.\r\n(2.3) An error is reported. However, the data has been written to the wal and memory, and an error occurs only during flushing. Therefore, do you need to clear the wal?\r\n\r\nMy current solution is:\r\n1. Restore the constant-frequency data.\r\n2. If the fault cannot be rectified and the input data is not constant-frequency data, a warning exception is thrown, the error data is deleted, and the error data is printed in the log.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/771508916/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/771544248","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iotdb/pull/2615#issuecomment-771544248","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/2615","id":771544248,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MTU0NDI0OA==","user":{"login":"sonarqubecloud[bot]","id":39514782,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mzk1MTQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/12526?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/sonarqubecloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-02T10:42:52Z","updated_at":"2021-02-02T10:42:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"SonarCloud
