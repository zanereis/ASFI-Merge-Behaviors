It could work like this.\r\n\r\n`I agree that some comments may describe too simple code lines, but shall we still accept comments on those complicated ones?`\r\n\r\nI think it is like with comments in general. You put them were you think that additional explanations are required to understand the code.  At the same time every comment is a liability. Comments tend to rott as they are not tested by junit. So over time a comment might describe something that is not matching the changed code anymore at all. This is why I favour improving the code instead of adding many comments. \r\n\r\nJiras can be used to track and explain the requirements. So sometimes links to them make sense. Unfortunately they do not track the changes over time. So possibly a jira represents a requirement at some point in time but later the requirement might have vanished or changed. The old jira issue will not reflect this. So adding the link is easy and can be automated as you demonstrate with your tool. Managing the link over time is much harder. \r\n\r\nThis is why I think adding the links on the fly while viewing from the blame feature is better. When the code is changed because of changed requirements then the on the fly tool will automatically change to the new jiras.
