The only major things I can find are mostly stylistic. The indentation is off in places though this can be hard to learn given that lots of couchdb doesn't really use a consistent style.\n\nThe bigger thing is that you've put all of this work into a single commit on this PR. I'd much prefer to see two or three commits that are descriptive in what's being changed. For instance, the fact that you called out three distinct pieces of work in your 1956Notes.txt on COUCHDB-1956 suggests that you're mixing work that shouldn't be. While one vs three commits may seem trivial it really helps during code review when specific changes aren't intermingled.\n\nYou should also try and include more information in your commit messages. You wrote some intro on the PR but none of that is in the commit message itself. If I ever look back at history I'd have to read the actual diff to remind myself what was changed. Tim Pope has a good article on writing commit messages [1].\n\nOther than that, the actual code changes are mostly fine from what I can tell. I haven't done more than read but assuming it builds and passes all tests I would be ok merging the work with bit of cleanup for things I mentioned.\n\nSo +1 after some style cleanup.\n\n[1] http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/33328785/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/33328907","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/138#issuecomment-33328907","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/138","id":33328907,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMzI4OTA3","user":{"login":"davisp","id":19929,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19929?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp","html_url":"https://github.com/davisp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-01-26T20:18:39Z","updated_at":"2014-01-26T20:18:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@benoitc It would be much more helpful if you commented on lines using the \"Files Changed\" tab.

Given that I just read this I think you're referring to `couch_httpd_db:receive_request_data/1` which now uses `couch_httpd:recv_chunked/1`. If so, then he is passing a callback. The issue is that the code that writes this stuff to disk also wants a callback. Basically we have some really crappy interfaces in CouchDB so you occasionally have to do process spawning to connect them together.\n\nI'd also assume that \"also, did you removed support for the content-length?\" refers to recv_chunked, which I also had to look into.

But we need to find a balance between merging quickly and making sure they the right patch for Couchdb. As @ziggythehamster said adding the es5-shim is not much more work and I think a much better addition. So I would prefer to see that added instead. At this stage we know that `indexOf` fails in one section. But we don't know if there are other features failing in other pages. Adding the shim should cover us.\n\n@ziggythehamster in terms of licensing. Just add the es5-shim license to the files NOTICE and LICENSE. Add the es5-shim file to license.skip.
