But perhaps you will write a more clear version. You are creating a buffered stream even resource stream is null. You close resource stream and then close buffered stream, but the second stream is wrapper for the first. This way, there is no need to close the resource stream because it will be closed automatically. I know your version of code is shorter and the sonarcloud will be quiet but we write code for programmers not for sonarcloud.
