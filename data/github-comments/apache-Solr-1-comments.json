Some indecision here too (hence my delayed response), due to the fact that I'm having a hard time brainstorming anything that I'd expect to make a difference (this being close to a refactoring in essence); but what you've suggested would serve well as a sanity check. How large would you consider a \"large index\" to be, for this purpose?\r\n\r\nWorst-case would probably involve combinations of `fq`, to generate uncached intersections. Because the \"work\" of determining leaf boundaries on SortedIntDocSet is now cached in the DocSet itself, as opposed to in the Filter, I'd expect performance of iterators over _cached_ DocSets to be better (assuming any perceptible difference at all). Are there any cases where iterators would be requested e.g. for the first leaf, but not later leaves (e.g. some kind of shortcircuit -- maybe `facet.exists`?)? That could also be a difference, since the boundaries for all leaves are now calculated up-front when the first iterator is requested.\r\n\r\ntbh I'd be surprised if any of this made a difference (improvement or regression) ... but of course nobody ever _expects_ to be surprised

However, I just want to clarify that this is a brand NEW end point, that never existed before.    There are two types of DELETE's now used:\r\n\r\nThe original single item, similar to V1:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl -X DELETE http://localhost:8983/api/cluster/command-status/1000\r\n```\r\nand then what I am proposing which is to delete all completed/error responses:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl -X DELETE http://localhost:8983/api/cluster/command-status\r\n```\r\n\r\nI want to mimic other RESTful approaches, so I looked at https://learn.co/lessons/rails-intro-to-rest, and it doesn't really appear that a DELETE is ever run on a whole category of items.   It's always one item at a time.   Which I guess does make sense....   How often do you want to dlete everythign!\r\n\r\nSo. what are thoughts on\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl -X DELETE http://localhost:8983/api/cluster/command-status?flush=true\r\n```\r\n\r\nI could do \r\n```\r\ncurl -X DELETE http://localhost:8983/api/cluster/command-status/state/flush\r\n```\r\n\r\nas well..     \r\n\r\nPoking about, I see advice that would suggest that you create new resources/end points:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPOST /api/path/to/your/collection:batchDelete\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo for us it would be:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X POST  http://localhost:8983/api/cluster/command-status:flush\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `:flush` syntax would be a new concept in our

I think `bin/solr` having an integration with Zookeeper makes a lot of sense, because Zookeeper is so tightly integrated inside of Solr. However Solr doesn't know what Zepplin is (correct me if I'm wrong here). I think it would be awesome to provide a detailed guide on using Solr and Zeppelin together, and either point to documentation on running Zeppelin, or have a short tutorial in the ref guide. However I'm not sure it's appropriate to have a command to start an unrelated service within `bin/solr`.

There is a lot of power around analytics locked up in Solr, and it's kind of hard to access.   I've mulled over trying to build out more analytics capablities in the Solr Admin, but that is a very steep climb.  I also thought about Jupyter, but the work that went into the analytics documentation was all based on Zeppelin, (plus another Apache project!) so it made sense to use it.  \r\n\r\n`bin/solr` to me feels like an entry to a whole grab bag of tools, not just core \"stop/start the Solr service\".   \r\n\r\nMaybe we should have had many other scripts in in `bin/` directory?   \r\n\r\n`bin/solr zeppelin` or maybe `bin/solr demo-analytics` is all a lot easier than downloading and installing Zeppelin, and getting it configured to talk to Solr.  \r\n\r\nI do think documenting how to connect Solr and Zeppelin would be a good thing!

A few replies inline.\r\n\r\n> what does this provide over running Zeppelin locally yourself?\r\n\r\nIt automates all of the needed setup behind a single command: `bin/solr zeppelin bootstrap`.  So in a word: convenience.  You're right that Solr doesn't \"know\" about Zeppelin the same way that it knows about ZK, though Zeppelin isn't a totally random tool either.  Our [\"Math Expressions\" docs](https://solr.apache.org/guide/8_8/math-expressions.html) make heavy use of Zeppelin screenshots, for instance.\r\n\r\n> I can see the use case for solr-bin add-ons, kind of like how kubectl does plugins.\r\n\r\nI tried making [making a proper Solr plugin out of this](https://github.com/gerlowskija/binsolr-zeppelin) a month or so back, but Solr's plugin framework isn't ready for this use case yet.  (Currently, the plugin infrastructure lives in CoreContainer so only running Solr nodes have access to plugin jars.  I was able to get my plugin installed, but SolrCLI couldn't see it to run ZeppelinTool).\r\n\r\nThat's all to say - I'm only going the direct bin/solr route here because other attempts at a plugin setup failed.\r\n\r\nCan you expand on the kubectl-plugin-like approach you have in mind?  I'm not against it necessarily, but I'm not sure I understand the benefits yet.  The large majority of the zeppelin integration logic lives in Java, with `bin/solr` really just being a passthrough call into Java-land. What does moving that passthrough over to `bin/plugins/zeppelin.sh` really get us?  i.e. if the Java logic stays where it is then there's no real separation.  If the Java logic moves then `bin/solr` will need to find the additional jar, modify the classpath it launches the JVM with, etc....all of which sounds dangerously like yet-another-Solr-plugin-framework.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/819722432/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/819812964","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/52#issuecomment-819812964","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/52","id":819812964,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxOTgxMjk2NA==","user":{"login":"dsmiley","id":377295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzI5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/377295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley","html_url":"https://github.com/dsmiley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-14T20:32:48Z","updated_at":"2021-04-14T20:32:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think this is ready; I'll merge it Friday.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/819812964/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/820211381","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/73#issuecomment-820211381","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/73","id":820211381,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyMDIxMTM4MQ==","user":{"login":"janhoy","id":409128,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTEyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/409128?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy","html_url":"https://github.com/janhoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-15T08:01:26Z","updated_at":"2021-04-15T08:01:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Intuitively, if you have 10 replicas, and 2 or them are active, and we have a leader, we are still ORANGE?

The new implementation appears 8% faster overall, excluding the optimization I added.  The data set was a million docs and a field with a gaussian distribution of terms.  The queries had a filter query with a term against that field, and it resulted in a SortedIntDocSet the vast majority of the time.  The main \"q\" query was a randomly produced phrase query that would always match some subphrase of a sentence found in many documents.  The benchmark produced 2000 consistently random queries and I re-ran this about 10 times and took the average of the fastest 3 runs.\r\n\r\nI added a small optimization to short-circuit intersect(DocSet) when there was no intersection change.  The % improvement moved to ~11%.  In my benchmark, there was another filter query that matched everything, and SolrIndexSearcher.getProcessedFilter would intersect that with the cached SortedIntDocSet producing a new SortedIntDocSet every time, and thus there was _never_ any cache re-use of cachedOrdIdxMap.  Of course this is highly dependent on the benchmarking scenario.  This really emphasizes how \"YMMV\" applies to benchmarking this stuff because it's so dependent on what the app's usage pattern looks like.  I think in some future JIRA issue, getProcessedFilter would be better off not intersecting any SortedIntDocSets; they could simply be added as separate filters in a BooleanQuery (dependent on SOLR-14166).\r\n\r\nSo I think this is ready to merge!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/821772007/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/821811819","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/41#issuecomment-821811819","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/41","id":821811819,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyMTgxMTgxOQ==","user":{"login":"epugh","id":22395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh","html_url":"https://github.com/epugh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-17T11:59:19Z","updated_at":"2021-04-17T11:59:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"okay, I think I am there on this...
