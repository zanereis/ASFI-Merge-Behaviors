This is a temporary solution; after Gobblin dataset is merged, I'll put it into the class hierarchy.\n- In addition to verifying data completeness using `DataCompletenessVerifier` (via Kafka audit), the `MRCompactorJobRunner` also performs a self-verification: when compaction of a dataset completes, if it finds new files that were added to the input folder after compaction started, it will discard the compacted data and re-do the compaction.\n- The compaction MR job of a dataset is no longer required to start after the data completeness verification of the dataset starts. Now it submits compaction MR jobs to one thread pool, and the completeness verification jobs to another thread pool, with no particular order between them.\n- `MRCompactor` no longer manages the thread pool for data completeness verification. That thread pool is now managed by `DataCompletenessVerifier`.\n- `DataCompletenessVerifier` no longer holds a reference to `MRCompactor`. Instead, it returns a `ListenableFuture<Results>` object, which `MRCompactor` can use to add callbacks and modify its states. This also means that data verification is no longer performed in the order of dataset priorities, since ExecutorService.submit() doesn't support prioritization through a priority queue (compaction MR jobs are stilled ordered by dataset priorities).\n- Added a `SimulatedDataCompletenessVerifier` class which randomly makes decisions.\n\nSmall changes:\n- Now it is possible to verify the completeness of multiple datasets together by using `DataCompletenessVerifier.verify(Iterable<Dataset>)`. This enables multiple datasets to share a single SQL query against Kafka audit.\n- Now it is possible to specify which datasets need completeness verification by using a whitelist and a blacklist.\n- Now one can specify the timeout for verifying data completeness, e.g. 30min. If after 30 minutes from the time the compaction starts, there are still some datasets whose completeness are not verified, those datasets will be given up, and their running verification jobs (if exists) will be killed. For these datasets, it is configurable whether to not compact them, or compact them anyway without completeness guarantee.\n- Moved some internal config keys from `ConfigurationKeys` to `MRCompactor`.\n- Improved Javadoc.\n- Addressed other comments in the review.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/142971668/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/143037980","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/331#issuecomment-143037980","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/331","id":143037980,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MzAzNzk4MA==","user":{"login":"ibuenros","id":1364112,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQxMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1364112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros","html_url":"https://github.com/ibuenros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-24T20:14:16Z","updated_at":"2015-09-24T20:14:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Talked with @ydailinkedin already.\nI don't think gobblin-data-management should depend on gobblin-runtime, as most of gobblin-runtime and gobblin-core is irrelevant to data management (apparently everything except the RateLimiters).\nRateLimiter should move to gobblin-utility.
