\r\nI have found a discussion about the hikari pool(https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP/issues/1116). \r\nBased on the results of the discussion, I think I should explicitly specify isReadOnly. If not specified, the jdbc driver will throw an exception unpredictably, resulting in a connection not being established properly.\r\n\r\nI think the YamlDataSourceParameter should add the isReadOnly parameter and set a default value, then\r\nconfig.setReadOnly(dataSourceParameter.isReadOnly());\r\n\r\nfor example, spring use the \"spring.datasource.read-only\" to specify isReadOnly\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if there are other objections.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/508820982/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/508886781","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/2664#issuecomment-508886781","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/2664","id":508886781,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwODg4Njc4MQ==","user":{"login":"sunbufu","id":14866067,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODY2MDY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14866067?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunbufu","html_url":"https://github.com/sunbufu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunbufu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunbufu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunbufu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunbufu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunbufu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunbufu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunbufu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunbufu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunbufu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-06T01:16:35Z","updated_at":"2019-07-06T01:16:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I have reproduced this issue.

thanks for your pr.\r\nIn your pr, you said that if there is no shardingRule, `RoutingEngine.newInstance()` and `RoutingEngine.newInstance()` will throw NPE. But when will the shardingRule be null? Because if you want to sharding tables, shardingRule is necessary, otherwise you can not start up.\r\nCan u give me some scenerios?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/508913565/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/508917464","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/pull/2666#issuecomment-508917464","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/2666","id":508917464,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwODkxNzQ2NA==","user":{"login":"sunbufu","id":14866067,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODY2MDY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14866067?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunbufu","html_url":"https://github.com/sunbufu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunbufu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunbufu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunbufu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunbufu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunbufu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunbufu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunbufu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunbufu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunbufu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-06T11:09:29Z","updated_at":"2019-07-06T11:09:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Hi, thanks for your pr.\r\n> In your pr, you said that if there is no shardingRule, `RoutingEngine.newInstance()` and `RoutingEngine.newInstance()` will throw NPE.

I agree with you, and In my view, I think `RoutingEngine.newInstance()` should throw `ShardingException` replace NPE, when `ShardingRule` is empty (include null). You can find this code on `RoutingEngineFactory` in line 68 to 70.\r\nAnd, I think `ShardingDataSourceNames` is same with `RoutingEngine`. This code in lines 45 to 47 on `ShardingDataSourceNames` of my PR.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/508917464/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/508924317","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/2601#issuecomment-508924317","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/2601","id":508924317,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwODkyNDMxNw==","user":{"login":"sunbufu","id":14866067,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODY2MDY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14866067?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunbufu","html_url":"https://github.com/sunbufu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunbufu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunbufu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunbufu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunbufu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunbufu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunbufu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunbufu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunbufu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunbufu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-06T12:51:26Z","updated_at":"2019-07-06T23:23:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi, I can do something about verify sharding rule and print some information.

my opinion, the purpose of `JDBC` is resolve different databases's compatibility. so `ResultSet` defined some method like `getBytes()`, `getBoolean()` and etc to help us get object with **expected java type**. \r\n`ShardingSphere` work on dataSource, and defined `ResultSet` too, like `ShardingResultSet` and `EncryptResultSet`. but `ShardingSphere` use **database column type** in place of **expected java type**. \r\nThere are some codes in `StreamQueryResult`, we can see `getValue()` **do nothing** with `final Class<?> type`.\r\n```java\r\n@Override\r\npublic Object getValue(final int columnIndex, final Class<?> type) throws SQLException {\r\n    return decrypt(columnIndex, QueryResultUtil.getValue(resultSet, columnIndex));\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAnd in `QueryResultUtil`, `getValueByColumnType()` get **database column type** from `resultSet. metaData` and use it for `getXXX()` selection.\r\n```java\r\npublic static Object getValueByColumnType(final ResultSet resultSet, final int columnIndex) throws SQLException {\r\n        ResultSetMetaData metaData = resultSet.getMetaData();\r\n        switch (metaData.getColumnType(columnIndex)) {\r\n            case Types.BIT:\r\n                return resultSet.getBytes(columnIndex);\r\n            case Types.BOOLEAN:\r\n                return resultSet.getBoolean(columnIndex);\r\n            case Types.TINYINT:\r\n                return resultSet.getByte(columnIndex);\r\n            ...\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nUsually it's okay, but when we use mysql and call some special methods such as `getBoolean()`, our **expected java type** is boolean,  **database column type** is not boolean. \r\nso I think we should pass on the **expected java type**, and use it for `getXXX()` selection.\r\nCan I send a PR
