Looking at other interpreters impl like #1164 one can see how to test I.e syntax errors and other conditions, etc\n- would it be hard or do you have plans to implement `cancel` and `getProgress` as part of this contribution? They are very usefull in case of big queries and improve user experience a lot on UI\n- in current code, you use static interpreter registration mechanism, which is now [deprecated](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-804) and all interpreters are in the process of migration. While we are here, in order not to create one more migration sub-tesk for later, could you please switch to `interpreter-settings.json` one instead? Its a dime change, here is an example of how it is done for another interpreter #1063 \n- every interpreter and it's supported/unsupported features and cobfiguration options are usually documented under `/docs/` which becomes part of the [website](http://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.6.0/development/howtocontributewebsite.html). Would you care to document this one as well?\n- for every new library introduced by this module, which Jar will end up in the release convenience binary (all, with default scope) we need to have a record in `https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/zeppelin-distribution/src/bin_license/LICENSE` specifying it's license\n\nFeel free to ask here, if something is not clearly or in case you have any further questions!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/232215164/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/232230652","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1145#issuecomment-232230652","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1145","id":232230652,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMjIzMDY1Mg==","user":{"login":"jongyoul","id":3612566,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTI1NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3612566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul","html_url":"https://github.com/jongyoul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-13T01:33:38Z","updated_at":"2016-07-13T01:33:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@Leemoonsoo I've check the default binding issues and I will fix it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/232230652/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/232236059","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1145#issuecomment-232236059","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1145","id":232236059,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMjIzNjA1OQ==","user":{"login":"jongyoul","id":3612566,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTI1NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3612566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul","html_url":"https://github.com/jongyoul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-13T02:17:31Z","updated_at":"2016-07-13T02:17:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@Leemoonsoo Concerning `sql interpreter not found`, I'll fix that issue with another one.
