This is used by the RO viewer if a certain Accep-Header\r\nis specified, and removes the need for an RO client to have to handle a\r\nspecial case of standalone lists... instead everything returned by the RO\r\nAPI is always just a domain object (either entity or view model).\r\n\r\nPerhaps in v2 we could push this idea deeper into the framework, so that\r\nany action that returns a collection is automatically wrapped in a\r\nDomainObjectList.\r\n\r\nThe only snag I can see is programmatic calls through a wrapper (ie wrapped\r\ntarget object by WrapperFactory); the caller would expect a collection so\r\nthe wrapper would need to extract from the DomainObjectList that holds it).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Wed, 12 Sep 2018, 16:55 Andi Huber, <notifications@github.com> wrote:\r\n\r\n>
