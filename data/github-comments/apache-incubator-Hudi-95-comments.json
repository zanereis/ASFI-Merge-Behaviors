Removed this logic because it created circular dependency when implementing timeline merging\r\n> \r\n> Following situation is technically possible. Timeline has commits c1, c2, c3, c4 and we have synced only upto C2. User decides to restore the table to commit time c2, thus generating rollback metadata for c3, c4 which now have no files in the metadata table. I think we should defensively handle this scenario at the payload merge level i.e if there is a delete for a file that does not exist in the base file or prior instants, we should just do a no-op and continue. What I am saying is : I agree with you that the extra logic need not be present, but we should check the payload once to ensure we can handle the scenario above.\r\n> \r\n> Let me know if we are not talking about the same thing :)\r\n\r\nIf this is the case what happens when c3 and c4 are then finally synced? These files would remain in the metadata table even though rollback should have removed them","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/749217844/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/749295310","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/2328#issuecomment-749295310","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/2328","id":749295310,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0OTI5NTMxMA==","user":{"login":"zhedoubushishi","id":31263084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjYzMDg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31263084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhedoubushishi","html_url":"https://github.com/zhedoubushishi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhedoubushishi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhedoubushishi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhedoubushishi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhedoubushishi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhedoubushishi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhedoubushishi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhedoubushishi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhedoubushishi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhedoubushishi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-22T02:03:36Z","updated_at":"2020-12-22T02:03:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> I see you have copy pasted most classes from existing ones.

Specifically, is there a chance of skipping a rollback instant incorrectly. \r\nLet's say we restored the last 11 commits (12 -> 2) with metadata synced upto C8\r\n\r\n```\r\ndata timeline : C1,  rollback C12, rollback C11, ..... rollback C2\r\nmetadata timeline : C1, C2, ... C8\r\n```\r\n\r\ndata timeline archival does not move past C8, but can technically archive C8. Similarly metadata timeline is free to archive independently and lets say it archives upto C2. If it ends up looking like \r\n\r\n```\r\ndata timeline : C1,  rollback C12, rollback C11, ..... rollback C2\r\nmetadata timeline: C3, ..., C8 \r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's now hard to determine whether or not `rollback C2` should be applied.

(we could compare the latest instant on metadata timeline C8 and assume its applied?)\r\n\r\nRegarding this scenario, my thoughts would be to check rollback metadata only against unsynced instants, i.e. if any instants after C8 were considered in rollback. Is this potentially surfacing a more general issue though. Say metadata timeline has been synced up to C2, but data timeline archival has happened to C8.

I did not have permission to update Pratyaksh's repo, hence created a new one. \r\n\r\nBasically, AbstractHoodieKafkaAvroDeserializer initializes SchemaProvider based on configs to fetch source scheme and target schema. In other words I have combined https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/1562 and https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/1565\r\n\r\nIf deserialize() is called w/ reader schema, same is used. If not, the one from schema provider is used. In either case, writer schema is fetched from schema provider. In previous patch from Pratyaksh, we were using the passed in schema as both reader and writer schema and hence schema evolution could run into issues. \r\n\r\nBut AbstractHoodieKafkaAvroDeserializer is inspired from Confluent schema-registry repo. I am not sure how to make this generic(as of now assumes the schema id at the beginning, followed by length and data). I haven't worked w/ schema registries nor w/ kafka/avro before. Will have to do research on what other ways we could deser kafka avro data. But as per Pratyaksh's comment, looks like usage of non schema registry flows are discouraged in general. So, not sure how much value we could add by supporting all diff ways to deser kafka avro data (i.e if not for confluent way). \r\n\r\nLet me know your thoughts. I am looking to get this into 0.7.0 (will be cutting a release in a weeks time). So, would appreciate if you can respond whenever you can. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/751280380/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/751283111","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/2012#issuecomment-751283111","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/2012","id":751283111,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1MTI4MzExMQ==","user":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-25T19:11:53Z","updated_at":"2020-12-25T19:11:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@n3nash : Looks like you folks(you and Balaji) have lot of context wrt this patch.
