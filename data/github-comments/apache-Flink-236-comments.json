The reason why I kept `DistinctAccumulator` is to act as a delegate to enclose the actual accumulator so that it can be passed around in the `accumulatorState` field without extending the arity.\r\n\r\nI guess if we separate the mapView with the accumulator. I guess I can separately create another field in the `accumulatorState` `Row` to store the `mapView`(s)... This way it might be easier to handle the \"reuse same mapView for multiple different distinct agg function\" case as we discussed in the doc.\r\n\r\nAnother question is I was trying to reuse as much utility of dataview codegen as possible, as most of them are tightly coupled with the accumulators.

We would not connect JM / RM / ZK if we use ```getByName(\"localhost\")``` . \r\n\r\nI will give an example based I have known about this issue.\r\n\r\nWe still can't believe ```getLocalHost()``` too much , as the file ```/etc/hosts``` once change the mapping of host name to an IP. That will cause a problem after that. And we will get different value( that you set the mapping including this value)\r\n\r\nBelow is my machine about this file, and I can always get a correct stuff of ```ricezhang-pjhzf.vclound.com/10.199.203.242``` (I use this IP for Internet access) with ```getLocalHost()``` that works for my network if I do not set that manually. \r\n\r\n```\r\n127.0.0.1   localhost localhost.localdomain localhost4 localhost4.localdomain4\r\n::1         localhost localhost.localdomain localhost6 localhost6.localdomain6\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce I modify that file like below though, I will always get an **incorrect** value with ```getLocalHost()```, because ```192.168.1.1``` is a a fake address. and will cause some issue.\r\n\r\n```\r\n127.0.0.1   localhost localhost.localdomain localhost4 localhost4.localdomain4\r\n::1         localhost localhost.localdomain localhost6 localhost6.localdomain6\r\n192.168.1.1 ricezhang-pjhzf.vclound.com\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs refers to this **instability** test, **I don't know if something dynamically modified that file on Travis** ? Or something like that ? Even if not, we also CAN NOT rely on this method to get a IP that can connect to. Once the ```Zookeeper``` records the incorrect IP address, this will cause error. We can not get a correct IP to connect to what we want.\r\n\r\nI agree with retry or a better test ( I do not know at this moment ) approach, I will study this issue in depth in these days.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/372248944/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/372250022","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/5449#issuecomment-372250022","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/5449","id":372250022,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MjI1MDAyMg==","user":{"login":"rice668","id":6520673,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MjA2NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6520673?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668","html_url":"https://github.com/rice668","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-12T09:47:19Z","updated_at":"2018-03-12T09:47:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I will verify whether retry can hack this issue first.

We could argue that if we do not find an interface to connect to the target address in a given time, we may not do too much about it rather than (a) failing now, (b) retrying forever, or (c) trying some heuristic that may work or fail later. The latter is implemented and seems sensible - we also print warnings to the log in that case.\r\n\r\nFor the unit test, however, I think, the actual check should be reduced to \"does return something and does not block\" since according to the code in `ConnectionUtils` we wouldn't verify the heuristic was successful anyway:\r\n```\r\n\t\t// our attempts timed out. use the heuristic fallback\r\n\t\tLOG.warn(\"Could not connect to {}. Selecting a local address using heuristics.\", targetAddress);\r\n\t\tInetAddress heuristic = findAddressUsingStrategy(AddressDetectionState.HEURISTIC, targetAddress, true);\r\n\t\tif (heuristic != null) {\r\n\t\t\treturn heuristic;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\telse {\r\n\t\t\tLOG.warn(\"Could not find any IPv4 address that is not loopback or link-local. Using localhost address.\");\r\n\t\t\treturn InetAddress.getLocalHost();\r\n\t\t}\r\n```\r\nWe could maybe cycle through `InetAddress.getAllByName(\"localhost\")` and verify the returned value is in there - unless I read this wrong - but I don't know if that check is of any actual value, to be honest.\r\n\r\nIf we wanted to test for more, the only outside sign of the heuristic strategy being used is to look at the logs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/372265880/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/372274254","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/5679#issuecomment-372274254","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/5679","id":372274254,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MjI3NDI1NA==","user":{"login":"yanghua","id":2283778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODM3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2283778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua","html_url":"https://github.com/yanghua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-12T11:13:08Z","updated_at":"2018-03-12T11:13:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@zentol thank you for suggestion, please review again.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/372274254/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/372280698","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/5449#issuecomment-372280698","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/5449","id":372280698,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MjI4MDY5OA==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-12T11:36:43Z","updated_at":"2018-03-12T11:36:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"We cannot fully guard against incorrect network configurations.\r\n\r\nMany systems (even HDFS,, AFAIK) simply use `InetAddress.getLocalHost()` and rely on correct network configs.
