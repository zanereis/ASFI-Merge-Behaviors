Looks like I accidentally removed too much when I attempted to remove the `latest` tag from 3.5 which was the cause of that error you observed. I have fixed that and run several tests deploying images with different versions to a personal dockerhub repo. You can see all of the tags here (https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/colegreer/gremlin-console/tags?page=1&ordering=last_updated, https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/colegreer/gremlin-server/tags?page=1&ordering=last_updated).\r\n\r\nI tested deployments of `3.5.6-SNAPSHOT`, `3.5.7`, `3.6.3-SNAPSHOT`, and `3.6.4` to ensure we are getting the correct tags for all of them.\r\n\r\nWhen running these tests I temporarily moved the `docker:push` execution from the `deploy` phase to the `install` phase as I wanted to test docker deployment without triggering any of the other deploy phase goals. It's also noteworthy that the new plugin does not attempt to build the full multi-arch image during the build goal. The reasoning for this being that multi-arch images are much larger in size and slow to build. The full multi-arch image is not built until the `push` goal is executed. This isn't ideal for us but there doesn't appear to be a good workaround with this plugin. Ultimately I don't think it is a big issue though, as we only need the multi-arch images during deployment.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1516940988/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1516965161","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/2029#issuecomment-1516965161","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/2029","id":1516965161,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc5aaw0p","user":{"login":"porunov","id":17673243,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NjczMjQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17673243?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/porunov","html_url":"https://github.com/porunov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/porunov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/porunov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/porunov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/porunov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/porunov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/porunov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/porunov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/porunov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/porunov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-20T21:23:32Z","updated_at":"2023-04-20T21:23:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Could you also add a CHANGELOG entry that quickly mentions the changes in these three related PRs?

It'll be great to have warnings which tells you that you aren't building the GLVs, but I'm not sure if it's necessarily worth adding an entire profile for each of the GLVs for this, given that there is documentation about them, and also we are considering removing the need to use `.glv` in 3.7.0 (as they were initially added due to GLV tests required environment set-up, but we are now using Docker which should be able to remove that need).\r\nWould there be an easier way to add the warning in an existing

In theory a user can run this from any platform with docker installed and build an image for any other platform they want. My expectation is that we could build images for all architectures supported by the [alpine base image](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine/tags) simply by adding them to the `<docker.platforms>` list. The only reason the list is currently limited to x86 and arm is that is all I am able to test. Also in my testing the ARM console image was unstable on my ARM Mac so I opted not to include it in the deployment here. I'm currently unsure what's causing this instability as the console runs fine on ARM without

For multi-query JanusGraph extension it could be I could simply access child traversal and inject some additional steps into it instead of overwriting the whole Repeat step. This approach might work for some steps but not for others. For example PropertiesStep / PropertyMap steps should be open because we are changing the way we access the data (i.e. overwriting logic), but for Repeat step I am not sure yet.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1525256448/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1525410168","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/2050#issuecomment-1525410168","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/2050","id":1525410168,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc5a6-l4","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-27T10:28:38Z","updated_at":"2023-04-27T10:28:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/tinkerpop/pull/2050?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) Report\n> Merging [#2050](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/tinkerpop/pull/2050?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (d008250) into [3.5-dev](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/tinkerpop/commit/b8d91efb45ed41d1cd4cd11a7f6e795b5c68a244?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (b8d91ef) will **decrease** coverage by `5.45%`.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n```diff\n@@              Coverage Diff              @@\n##             3.5-dev    #2050      +/-   ##\n=============================================\n- Coverage      69.88%   64.43%   -5.45%     \n=============================================\n  Files            841       25     -816     \n  Lines          37412     3821   -33591     \n  Branches        5418        0    -5418     \n=============================================\n- Hits           26144     2462   -23682     \n+ Misses          9532     1187    -8345     \n+ Partials        1736      172    -1564     \n```\n\n\n[see 866 files with indirect coverage changes](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/tinkerpop/pull/2050/indirect-changes?src=pr&el=tree-more&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation)\n\n:mega: We’re building smart automated test selection to slash your CI/CD build times.
