We can discuss whether nbjavac is really a good idea, but at this point in time it is an integral part of the core of Java editing in NetBeans and I think it might help catching bugs.\r\n\r\n@matthiasblaesing github workflows can't really trigger on particular labels unfortunately. I believe the easiest way to build using nb-javac when the label is set would be to simply paste the proposed job into the main.yaml.\r\n\r\ncopy this:\r\nhttps://github.com/matthiasblaesing/netbeans/blob/623a396c8ed341834d080eb7f4a1d2aa487e6b87/.github/workflows/nb-javac.yml#L6-L28\r\n(rename `linux` to `nb-javac` for example, since that would be the job handle)\r\n\r\nand paste it somewhere below `base-build` in main.yaml\r\n\r\nhaving it as separate workflow is fine in theory, but it would startup and do nothing most of the time and create empty runs on that list:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/netbeans/actions\r\n\r\ni would also recommend to remove the `|| github.event_name != 'pull_request'` and `ci:all-tests` conditions so that it doesn't have to run outside of PRs which set the label.\r\n\r\nThe cache should be used too so that we don't DDoS someone:\r\n```\r\n  - name: Restore Cache\r\n    uses: actions/cache/restore@v3\r\n    with:\r\n      path: ~/.hgexternalcache\r\n      key: ${{ runner.os }}-${{ hashFiles('*/external/binaries-list', '*/*/external/binaries-list') }}\r\n      restore-keys: ${{ runner.os }}-\r\n```\r\nthis should only restore the cache based on hash match or prefix as fallback but never store, other then that it works analog to the base-build job. (never used the restore action before, its a fairly new feature they added earlier this year)\r\n\r\nFor the record: I have nothing against nb-javac and do agree it is an important dependency of the java editor right now. However, the testing of nb-javac should be done in the nb-javac repository, not in a downstream repository in my opinion. What should we even do if that one job is red? Not merge a PR? Wait for nb-javac to fix something, upload a binary to central and test again?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1484233047/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1484238035","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/5336#issuecomment-1484238035","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5336","id":1484238035,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5Yd6zT","user":{"login":"eirikbakke","id":886243,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NjI0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/886243?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke","html_url":"https://github.com/eirikbakke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-26T22:05:05Z","updated_at":"2023-03-26T22:05:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for these comments!
