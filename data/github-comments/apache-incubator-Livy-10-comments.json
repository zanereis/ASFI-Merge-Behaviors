I got it running so that it created the driver pod, but I was unable to fully start the driver due to using my own spark image, which requires some configuration parameters to be passed in.\r\n\r\nHere's some feedback:\r\n\r\n- Helm chart doesn't allow to specify \"serviceAccount\" property for Livy.\r\n\r\n- Couldn't find a way to set namespace which Livy must use. It seems to try to want to search all pods in all namespaces. Also need to set the namespace where the pods are created (Seems to be fixed to \"default\")\r\n\r\n- Could you provide a way to fully customise the driver pod specification? I would want to set custom volumes and volume-mounts, environment variables, labels, sidecar containers and possibly even customise the command line arguments for the driver.\r\n\r\n- Also a way to provide custom spark configuration settings for the driver pod would be required.\r\n\r\n- Support for macros for both customising the driver pod and the extra spark configuration options. I would at least need the id of the livy session (eg. \"livy-session-2-9SZP8Ijv\") to be inserted to both the pod template and the spark configuration options.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I don't know Scala really well, so I couldn't really dig into the code easily to determine how this works, so I'm not unable to provide you with more detailed recommendations.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/comments/484410514/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/comments/484451486","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-livy/pull/167#issuecomment-484451486","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/167","id":484451486,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NDQ1MTQ4Ng==","user":{"login":"jahstreet","id":19328972,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzI4OTcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19328972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jahstreet","html_url":"https://github.com/jahstreet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jahstreet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jahstreet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jahstreet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jahstreet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jahstreet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jahstreet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jahstreet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jahstreet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jahstreet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-18T10:51:51Z","updated_at":"2019-04-18T10:52:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@garo Thanks for the review.\r\n\r\nHere are some explanations on you questions:\r\n\r\n- First version of chart were done without RBAC support. I've just done with RBAC support solution for Livy chart and not yet merged it, you can refer feature branch https://github.com/jahstreet/spark-on-kubernetes-helm/blob/charts/livy/rbac-support/charts/livy/values.yaml:\r\nserviceAccount:\r\n  //Specifies whether a service account should be created\r\n  create: true\r\n  //The name of the service account to use.\r\n  //If not set and create is true, a name is generated using the fullname template\r\nname:\r\n\r\n- Livy searches for a Driver Pod in all namespaces (theoretically user may want to use any namespace to submit job to) for the first time to initialize KubernetesApplication object, then it uses that object (which contains field namespace) to get Spark Pods states and logs and looks for that information only within 1 target namespace (I've added comments to the lines where this logic is done).\r\n\r\n- By default Livy should submit Spark App to `default` namespace (if it is not done so, than I need to make a fix ;)) ). You can change that behavior by adding `spark.kubernetes.namespace=<desired_namespaces>` to /opt/spark/conf/spark-defaults.conf in Livy container. Livy entrypoint is done so that it can set spark-defaults configs with env variables, so you can set Livy container env `LIVY_SPARK_KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE=<desired_namespaces>` to change Spark Apps default namespace. In the new version of Livy chart I set it to `.Release.Namespace`. And of course you can pass it as additional conf on App submission within POST request to Livy: `{ ... \"conf\": { \"spark.kubernetes.namespace\":\"<desired_namespaces>\"}, ... }` to overwrite defaults.\r\n\r\n- Please refer some customization explanations to Livy: https://github.com/jahstreet/spark-on-kubernetes-helm/tree/master/charts/livy#customizing-livy-server\r\nFollowing that approach you can set any config defaults to both Livy and Spark. If you need to overwrite some - do that on job submission in the POST request body.\r\n\r\n- To customize Driver Pod spec we need a custom build of Spark installed to Livy image (Livy just runs spark-submit). I refer to the official releases of Apache Spark and do not see available options for that at present (including adding sidecars). But it has configs to set `volumes and volume-mounts, environment variables, labels` (https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/running-on-kubernetes.html#spark-properties), which we can set to default values as I described before.\r\n\r\n- Customize the command line arguments for the driver - you mean application args? You can pass them on job submission in the POST request body: https://livy.incubator.apache.org/docs/latest/rest-api.html\r\nOr you need custom spark-submit script options?\r\n\r\n- Why do you need the id of the Livy session and what kind of macros for both customizing the driver pod and the extra spark configuration options do you mean?\r\n\r\nCould you provide the example of a Job you wanna run? I hope I will be able to show you the available solutions using that example.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/comments/484451486/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/comments/484468651","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-livy/pull/167#issuecomment-484468651","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/167","id":484468651,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NDQ2ODY1MQ==","user":{"login":"garo","id":381921,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MTkyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/381921?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/garo","html_url":"https://github.com/garo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-18T11:41:13Z","updated_at":"2019-04-18T11:41:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you very much for the detailed response! I'm just leaving for my easter holiday so I am not going to be able to actually try again until after that.\r\n\r\nI however created this gist showing how we create the spark drivers in our current workflow: We run Azkaban (like a glorified cron service) which runs our spark applications. Each application (ie. a scheduled cron execution) starts a spark driver pod into kubernetes. If you look at this gist https://gist.github.com/garo/90c6e69d2430ef7d93ca9f564ba86059 there is first a build of spark-submit configuration parameters following with the yaml for the driver pod.\r\n\r\nSo I naturally tried to think how I can use Livy to launch the same image with same kind of settings. I think that with your explanations I can implement most if not all of these settings except the run_id. \r\n\r\nLets continue this discussion after easter.

IIRC, the thriftserver needed a newer version of the libraries which are in the dependencies of the hadoop module.\r\n\r\nI think the solution might be to keep the exclusion form the hadoop dependencies and add a dependency on the needed jars in Livy, so that we do not rely on what is part of the hadoop distribution but we have control on it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/comments/486313112/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/comments/486313177","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-livy/pull/170#issuecomment-486313177","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/170","id":486313177,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NjMxMzE3Nw==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-24T16:19:36Z","updated_at":"2019-05-06T05:31:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-livy/pull/170?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#170](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-livy/pull/170?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-livy/commit/5abc043708b443ba36612a4f4e2f5137bd63621a?src=pr&el=desc) will **decrease** coverage by `0.08%`.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-livy/pull/170/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&token=0MkVbiUFwE&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-livy/pull/170?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@             Coverage Diff              @@\n##             master     #170      +/-   ##\n============================================\n- Coverage     68.67%   68.58%   -0.09%     \n+ Complexity      907      904       -3     \n============================================\n  Files           100      100              \n  Lines          5666     5666              \n  Branches        850      850              \n============================================\n- Hits           3891     3886       -5     \n- Misses         1223     1226       +3     \n- Partials        552      554       +2\n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-livy/pull/170?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage Δ | Complexity Δ | |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [...c/main/scala/org/apache/livy/repl/ReplDriver.scala](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-livy/pull/170/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-cmVwbC9zcmMvbWFpbi9zY2FsYS9vcmcvYXBhY2hlL2xpdnkvcmVwbC9SZXBsRHJpdmVyLnNjYWxh) | `30.76% <0%> (-2.57%)` | `7% <0%> (ø)` | |\n| [...ain/java/org/apache/livy/rsc/driver/RSCDriver.java](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-livy/pull/170/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-cnNjL3NyYy9tYWluL2phdmEvb3JnL2FwYWNoZS9saXZ5L3JzYy9kcml2ZXIvUlNDRHJpdmVyLmphdmE=) | `77.96% <0%> (-2.12%)` | `41% <0%> (-1%)` | |\n| [...main/scala/org/apache/livy/server/LivyServer.scala](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-livy/pull/170/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-c2VydmVyL3NyYy9tYWluL3NjYWxhL29yZy9hcGFjaGUvbGl2eS9zZXJ2ZXIvTGl2eVNlcnZlci5zY2FsYQ==) | `35.46% <0%> (-0.5%)` | `11% <0%> (ø)` | |\n| [...cala/org/apache/livy/scalaapi/ScalaJobHandle.scala](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-livy/pull/170/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-c2NhbGEtYXBpL3NyYy9tYWluL3NjYWxhL29yZy9hcGFjaGUvbGl2eS9zY2FsYWFwaS9TY2FsYUpvYkhhbmRsZS5zY2FsYQ==) | `55.88% <0%> (+5.88%)` | `7% <0%> (ø)` | :arrow_down: |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-livy/pull/170?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-livy/pull/170?src=pr&el=footer).

That jar/path is never used in the server side (it should not be used, at least). And in the ITs which are failing, hence, that path is not considered at all.\r\nI see, instead, that there is a test dependency on `hadoop-common` in the `livy-integration-test` module, which brings `jersey-core-1.9`.

You might want and try to exclude it from there too.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/comments/487362756/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/comments/487370084","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-livy/pull/166#issuecomment-487370084","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/166","id":487370084,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NzM3MDA4NA==","user":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-28T11:22:48Z","updated_at":"2019-04-28T11:22:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> If we are calling stop when it is not necessary, I think we should rather avoid calling it in those cases.\r\n\r\nI was thinking about that way, but I was not sure whether it's the only place where calling stop unnecssary.

If the package does not have ``jersey-core`` or it has ``jersey-core 1.9``, the test succeeded. \r\n\r\nSince a thrift/client jar/path is never used in the server side, I think we can have a different jersey-core version for livy-server and thrift/client.
