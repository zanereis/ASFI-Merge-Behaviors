Insert and Upsert write the data with table column set. \r\n2. Delete operation did need to generate temporary composite key to delete valid records but made an error of writing the additional column into the parquet. \r\n3. Querying after delete did show valid records. \r\n4. Insert or Upsert after delete would write a parquet that wouldnt have missing column written in step 2. \r\n5. When queried the old records in the table wouldnt appear at all. \r\n\r\nSo this would seem that insert or upsert after delete is not working. Very simple bug.

These changes are `not sufficient` to support `Decimal` types it seems.\r\n\r\nThe tables in Hive end up being created with `Binary` type for `Decimal` type columns, making them un-queryable.\r\n\r\n```\r\nhive> describe my_table;\r\n_hoodie_commit_time \tstring              \t                    \r\n_hoodie_commit_seqno\tstring              \t                    \r\n_hoodie_record_key  \tstring              \t                    \r\n_hoodie_partition_path\tstring              \t                    \r\n_hoodie_file_name   \tstring \r\n....\r\nwholesale_cost   \tbinary  // Should have been Decimal(7,2)   \t                    \r\nlist_price       \tbinary  // Should have been Decimal(7,2)\t                    \r\nsales_price      \tbinary  // Should have been Decimal(7,2) \t                    \r\ndiscount_amt \tbinary  // Should have been Decimal(7,2)\r\n```\r\n\r\nUpon diving further into this issue, I am able to narrow it down to this line, where the Parquet footer is read to get the schema which is written as `parquet.avro.schema`\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-hudi/blob/master/hudi-hive/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/hive/HoodieHiveClient.java#L437\r\n\r\nWhat is happening here, is that in this schema conversion from `parquet.avro.schema` to Parquet's schema i.e. `MessageType` it is loosing context of Avro's `LogicalType Decimal`.\r\n\r\nThe following blob for `Decimal` in `parquet.avro.schema`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"name\" : \"wholesale_cost\",\r\n    \"type\" : [ {\r\n      \"type\" : \"fixed\",\r\n      \"name\" : \"wholesale_cost\",\r\n      \"size\" : 4,\r\n      \"logicalType\" : \"decimal\",\r\n      \"precision\" : 7,\r\n      \"scale\" : 2\r\n    }, \"null\" ]\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nIt end's up as following upon conversion to `MessageType`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"name\" : \"wholesale_cost\",\r\n    \"type\" : [ \"null\", {\r\n      \"type\" : \"fixed\",\r\n      \"name\" : \"wholesale_cost\",\r\n      \"namespace\" : \"\",\r\n      \"size\" : 4\r\n    } ],\r\n    \"default\" : null\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nThus any context of this field being `Decimal` is lost. Now, when this parquet schema is later converted to hive schema to generate the DDL for creating table, it treats is `Fixed Length Byte Array`.\r\n\r\nThe following line which checks whether `OriginalType` is `Decimal` has no affect, because `OriginalType` ends up as `Null` for `Decimal` fields:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-hudi/blob/master/hudi-hive/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/hive/util/SchemaUtil.java#L179\r\n\r\nUltimately it is converting it to `Binary` by treating it as `Fixed Length Byte Array`:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-hudi/blob/master/hudi-hive/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/hive/util/SchemaUtil.java#L218\r\n\r\nCreate Table command generated by Hudi:\r\n```\r\n19/09/16 23:53:35 INFO HoodieHiveClient: Creating table with CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE  IF NOT EXISTS xxxx( `_hoodie_commit_time` string, `_hoodie_commit_seqno` string, `_hoodie_record_key` string, `_hoodie_partition_path` string, `_hoodie_file_name` string,  ... `wholesale_cost` binary, `list_price` binary, `sales_price` binary, `discount_amt` binary...)
