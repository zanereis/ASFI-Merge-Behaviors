But it seems the Hive upstream guys didn't give any prompt response to this PR, which maybe block our release. Could you please post a separate Jira/post in our Bigtop to fix this issues (`patch-x-Fix-WebHCat-xxx.diff `in [Hive path](https://github.com/apache/bigtop/tree/master/bigtop-packages/src/common/hive))correspondingly?
