observation is correct the console does not show information about the task location after it is done. Currently the information like start time, task location is not saved when the task is done. Only task id, status, duration and task payload are saved. \r\n\r\nAs far as I know, I think the reason being when middle manager nodes were introduced the idea was they are considered ephemeral in the sense new MMs can be spawned on demand and when not required they can be taken down. Thus, it does not help much to save task location information.\r\n\r\nHowever, you can still access the logs from the console, you will need to send them to deep storage so that they can be streamed from there on demand.

It has the same sort of behavior.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/296797971/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/296856238","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/4131#issuecomment-296856238","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4131","id":296856238,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5Njg1NjIzOA==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-25T00:16:36Z","updated_at":"2017-04-25T00:16:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@drcrallen @himanshug able to take another look?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/296856238/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/296863679","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/4118#issuecomment-296863679","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4118","id":296863679,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5Njg2MzY3OQ==","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-25T01:13:14Z","updated_at":"2017-04-25T01:13:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Reopened this pr due to a travis failure.

What do you think?\r\n\r\nI might have more specific ideas after reading through…","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/296965662/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/297104327","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/4205#issuecomment-297104327","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4205","id":297104327,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NzEwNDMyNw==","user":{"login":"fjy","id":428325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODMyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy","html_url":"https://github.com/fjy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-25T17:25:09Z","updated_at":"2017-04-25T17:25:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"👍 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/297104327/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/297104743","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/4195#issuecomment-297104743","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4195","id":297104743,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NzEwNDc0Mw==","user":{"login":"fjy","id":428325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODMyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy","html_url":"https://github.com/fjy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-25T17:26:42Z","updated_at":"2017-04-25T17:26:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"👍 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/297104743/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/297122162","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/4141#issuecomment-297122162","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4141","id":297122162,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NzEyMjE2Mg==","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-25T18:25:59Z","updated_at":"2017-04-25T18:25:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The patch looks good to me.
