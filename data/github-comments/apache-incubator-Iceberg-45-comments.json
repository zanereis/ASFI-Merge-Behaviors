I used a Spark job to count the record after writing into the Iceberg table and it did not show the expected the number. By accident, I found that the version nuber in version-hint was not the same as the latest metadata json. \r\nA Flink job is used to write into Iceberg and I use MergeAppend and Transaction.commitTransaction() to do the commit. The table instance is not cached.\r\n\r\nSorry that I could not re-create it or recall all actions I made that day. I guess the incorrect read might be due to that ont only was version-hint not updated correctly, but at least one metadata json file is also not written correctly due to the improper permissions.

That's similar to a solution we may want to use, although I think we would need to do it differently: the partition function must be well-defined and cannot depend on the environment. I think we would want to add either 23 new functions (one for each offset) or add an offset parameter to the function, similar to the bucket width and truncation length.\r\n\r\nThe reason why the partitioning is UTC is that we just need to break data up into day-sized partitions. The actual partition boundaries would ideally not matter. If you need data split across files at some boundary for deletes, then we would normally recommend hourly partitioning to ensure that you can delete any hour individually.\r\n\r\n> I don't understand why iceberg must use UTC time zone in the time partition directory. The user's time data in other time zones is prone to the problems described in #1354 .\r\n\r\nThe requirement is that Iceberg must be consistent. Whatever one engine uses, all the others must as well. That's why I'm saying that the function would need to be parameterized and we would need to add the offsets to the spec.\r\n\r\nAlso, I should note that `dynamicOverwrite` is supported, but not considered a best practice. We don't recommend using `dynamicOverwrite` because it can lead to situations like what you hit in #1354. The problem is that the data being overwritten is _implicit_ based on the data written.\r\n\r\nIf your job had a bug and wrote a single record from another day -- even if the zone problem were fixed -- then that record would overwrite that day worth of data. This is why we added the `overwrite(Expression)` action in `DataFrameWriterV2`. That is explicit about what data is deleted when your job commits. That is a much more reliable pattern.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/676591216/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/676616324","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1344#issuecomment-676616324","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1344","id":676616324,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3NjYxNjMyNA==","user":{"login":"RussellSpitzer","id":413025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/413025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer","html_url":"https://github.com/RussellSpitzer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-19T19:27:06Z","updated_at":"2020-08-19T19:27:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@aokolnychyi + @rdblue this is the followup to the StaticTableOperation ticket #1342 using the improvement inside ExpireSnapshotActions, now with no caching!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/676616324/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/676733881","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1344#issuecomment-676733881","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1344","id":676733881,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3NjczMzg4MQ==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-19T21:50:15Z","updated_at":"2020-08-19T21:50:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This looks great, @RussellSpitzer!
