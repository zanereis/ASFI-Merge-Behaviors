This was the JSON writer, specifically. Haven't tried with the Avro writer, but in any case we need to ensure that this has high performance for all cases.\r\n\r\nI wonder if a better option may be to add some sort of `rebind(OuptutStream)` method to RecordWriter, so that it would reset itself to write to a new Output Stream. This would avoid having to recreate potentially expensive objects for every single record. Then, instead of creating a new writer each time, we can just re-bind the existing writer to a new OutputStream, write the record, flush, and repeat.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/350056568/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/350064241","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2292#issuecomment-350064241","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2292","id":350064241,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MDA2NDI0MQ==","user":{"login":"joewitt","id":3057465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTc0NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3057465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt","html_url":"https://github.com/joewitt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-07T19:07:57Z","updated_at":"2017-12-07T19:07:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ok, so slower is really bad.

My name is William Nouet and I am a big fan of the NiFi project. I believe this is revolutionizing the way the industry is handling data transport and transformation. I would love to be involved in the project and its open source community; so I created a JIRA (NIFI-3518) and decided to help close another one (NIFI-385).\n\nI got some amazing feedback and guidance from the community while working on the above 2 JIRAs, updated my code to make sure it lives up to the NiFi standards. That being said, I haven’t been able to get any traction on getting the code pushed to the main branch for the past few months, hence this emailZ\n\nPlease let me know if there is anything I can do to get the ball rolling. I would be happy to re-work on my code if you think it can be improved and would more than happy to meet in person in a bar or a coffee shop if some of you guys are in the NYC metro area.\n\nThank you in advance.\n\nBest,\n\nWilliam\n\nEnvoyé de mon iPhone\n\n> Le 6 oct. 2017 à 16:16, Joe Witt <notifications@github.com> a écrit :\n> \n> Is there anyone familiar with morphlines that can help test/review?\n> \n> —\n> You are receiving this because you authored the thread.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or mute the thread.\n> \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/351096953/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/351101631","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2028#issuecomment-351101631","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2028","id":351101631,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MTEwMTYzMQ==","user":{"login":"joewitt","id":3057465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTc0NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3057465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt","html_url":"https://github.com/joewitt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-12T16:18:02Z","updated_at":"2017-12-12T16:18:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@WilliamNouet Sorry for the trouble.

it is very much a non-trivial effort! For the most part, the code looks good. I flagged a couple of minor things in the code, 1 or 2 thread-safety issues that should be easy to address.\r\n\r\nThe only 'more significant' concern that I have is the use of the dummied-up NiFiUser. As-is, this is an anonymous user and in a secured environment will not retrieve the event details that are necessary. It also means that we would be validating events against a user who doesn't even exist.\r\n\r\nI think there are 2 ways to approach this: first, as I noted inline, we could have a property to define which user the queries should run on behalf of. So the user could add a \"NiFi Atlas\" user and use that. However, that's also a bit concerning because it means that whoever has access to edit the reporting task can run provenance queries on behalf of another user.\r\n\r\nBy far, my preference is to actually just update the ProvenanceRepository implementations (There are 4 now, I think) so that if a null User is passed in, we don't check permissions. This would mean that you can pass in null from Reporting Task. We could also then update the interface to have an overloaded method that does not require that a user be given.\r\n\r\nOnce that is addressed, I think it is a +1 from me from a code review perspective.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n-Mark","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/351800825/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/351820565","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2341#issuecomment-351820565","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2341","id":351820565,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MTgyMDU2NQ==","user":{"login":"mcgilman","id":123395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzM5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman","html_url":"https://github.com/mcgilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-14T20:03:07Z","updated_at":"2017-12-14T20:03:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @kevdoran!

We have to do most of the schema resolution/management manually, Jackson's methods for handling that don't seem to work for what we need.

It uses the event hierarchies returned by that method, but to analyze each event detail fully, it also calls `ProvenanceEventRepository.getEvent(final long id)` which does not require user. That's why the reporting task worked even in a secured NiFi cluster.\r\n\r\nI now understand why NiFi framework has two interfaces for provenance events, i.e. ProvenanceRepository and ProvenanceEventRepository. `ProvenanceRepository` provides methods to be called in a context with a user who made the request. `ProvenanceEventRepository` is used outside of a user request, intended for Reporting Tasks, etc.\r\n\r\nIs my understanding correct?
