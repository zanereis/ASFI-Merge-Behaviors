After applying your fix the problem went away without causing adverse side-effects that I could tell. If we want to be on the safe side, we could check if `df[metric]` is a `DataFrame` and call `iloc` on that. But I agree that there shouldn't be duplicate columns anymore, so it might very well just introduce unnecessary clutter into the codebase.

@doctording, thanks for this issue! So I can get an idea of how to help with this, I was wondering how you were using the dashboard add feature. In particular, if you add via code (rather than the GUI in the browser), the examples that are in this repo in the 'superset/data/' directory all directly add dashboards to the underlying database, rather than calling an internal method that has the potential to check uniqueness before adding a dashboard to the database. For your use case, would it be possible to modify one of these examples and create dashboards via code, rather than the GUI? (I'm a new volunteer and I think adding this feature is going to require a significant code refactor, which I'm very hesitant to do at this time.)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/496580376/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/496598684","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/6610#issuecomment-496598684","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/6610","id":496598684,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NjU5ODY4NA==","user":{"login":"villebro","id":33317356,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzE3MzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33317356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro","html_url":"https://github.com/villebro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-28T16:51:03Z","updated_at":"2019-05-28T16:51:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Let's leave this open for a few days to see if anyone has something to add.

So I can get an idea of how to help with this, I was wondering how you were using the dashboard add feature. In particular, if you add via code (rather than the GUI in the browser), the examples that are in this repo in the 'superset/data/' directory all directly add dashboards to the underlying database, rather than calling an internal method that has the potential to check uniqueness before adding a dashboard to the database. For your use case, would it be possible to modify one of these examples and create dashboards via code, rather than the GUI? (I'm a new volunteer and I think adding this feature is going to require a significant code refactor, which I'm very hesitant to do at this time.)\r\n\r\nI want this like a file system\r\n```\r\ndashboard_directory1 \r\n      dash1\r\n      dash2\r\ndashboard_directory2\r\n     dash1(the same name of `dashboard_directory1`'s dash1, but for different uses)\r\n     dash3\r\n```\r\n\r\none dashboard directory contains dashboards with unique name\r\ndifferent dashboard directories contain a different type of dashboard","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/496774497/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/496776837","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/7129#issuecomment-496776837","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/7129","id":496776837,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5Njc3NjgzNw==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-29T04:13:26Z","updated_at":"2019-05-29T04:13:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Ideal would be for someone to contribute the feature in `react-select` https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select/issues/3223 , please add a \"thumbs up\" on the issue!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/496776837/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/496786991","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/7524#issuecomment-496786991","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/7524","id":496786991,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5Njc4Njk5MQ==","user":{"login":"thenooz","id":16484838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDg0ODM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16484838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenooz","html_url":"https://github.com/thenooz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenooz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenooz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenooz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenooz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenooz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenooz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenooz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenooz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenooz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-29T05:12:17Z","updated_at":"2019-05-29T05:12:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @mistercrunch , can you please look into this?

It could be useful to get the output of `show create table tables` from mysql as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/496820717/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/496822327","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/7599#issuecomment-496822327","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/7599","id":496822327,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NjgyMjMyNw==","user":{"login":"elukey","id":1536240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzYyNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1536240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elukey","html_url":"https://github.com/elukey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elukey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elukey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elukey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elukey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elukey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elukey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elukey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elukey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elukey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-29T07:38:22Z","updated_at":"2019-05-29T07:38:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@SamuelMarks quick question to clarify - did you first try to install superset via pip and then tried building from the git repo?
