Perhaps a bit of randomness layered onto the placement would help with placement diversity?  But I confess this really is just a draft PR; I didn't try to deeply understand why *all* replicas get weighted.  I was encouraged to see all tests pass, so clearly there's a test gap that would allow this change to go in yet be quite flawed.  I found no tests specific to SimplePlacementPlugin, the one we used with the change here.\r\n\r\nWe're going a different direction that does not use an OrderedNodePlacementPlugin foundation; we will not return to this matter to fix it, unfortunately.\r\n\r\nRE Collection listing:  IMO it should definitely continue to be supported.  My objection is producing java.util.Collection or Iterable or Map of basically any aggregate of the state of a collection (e.g. SolrCollectoin, DocCollection, etc.).  List collections by name, then force the caller to resolve a name to a state if it must.  A bit of API friction can be a good thing where we know there are performance issues.

This PR aims to convert the API(s) to JAX-RS without delving too deeply into cleaning up the underlying implementation.  I think some of the stuff you commented on is innocuous enough that I can be tempted into making a few cleanups though, particularly some of the naming and javadoc/comment issues. \r\n\r\n> Do we still need DistribFileStore in a world with ClusterFileStore?\r\n\r\nYes, we do.  There's some naming-related confusion going on here that I've definitely caused:\r\n\r\n1. `FileStore` is an interface that defines the operations that Solr's file-store has to support.\r\n2. `DistribFileStore` is the lone implementation of the `FileStore` interface.\r\n3. `ClusterFileStore` is the entrypoint for the relevant v2 APIs.\r\n\r\n`ClusterFileStore` is, on its surface, a pretty bad naming choice given the pre-existing `FileStore` interface.  It 100% appears to be an implementation of that interface, but it's not.\r\n\r\nI do have an excuse, though it may be a bad one 😛 I chose `ClusterFileStore` for the v2 API class name to be consistent with a naming convention we've had since creating the \"api\" gradle module earlier this year.  (i.e. interfaces in \"api\" module are `FooApi`, with classes in solr-core being `Foo`).\r\n\r\nThe filestore (for reasons I still don't really understand) makes APIs available under two paths: `/api/cluster/files` and `/api/node/files`.  So I chose `ClusterFileStoreApi`/`ClusterFileStore` partially in an attempt to distinguish between these two sets of filestore APIs, and partially to maintain consistency with the existing naming convention.\r\n\r\nThe end result is clearly confusing; very open if anyone has other suggestions that'd avoid the ambiguity and confusion!?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2121513823/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2121526630","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2470#issuecomment-2121526630","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2470","id":2121526630,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5-c-1m","user":{"login":"epugh","id":22395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh","html_url":"https://github.com/epugh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-21T01:22:02Z","updated_at":"2024-05-21T01:22:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"If `DistribFileStore` is the lone implementation of `FileStore`, then do we need `FileStore`?

Idk about \"do everything\", but ClusterFileStore/ClusterFileStoreApi will eventually _expose everything_ that DistribFileStore supports.\r\n\r\nAnd I don't think that's a bad thing - it's an intentional \"separation of concerns\" thing.  \"ClusterFileStore\"/\"ClusterFileStoreApi\" define the HTTP interface an end-user sees, and some of the API concerns around that.  \"DistribFileStore\" is concerned with how we actually implement the \"Filestore\" idea in a SolrCloud context.  In theory, we could rewrite the filestore entirely without having to touch the API code, and that's a good thing!\r\n\r\nThe names are a mess and that definitely needs straightened out, but even in the long term IMO each of these classes has a distinct purpose that make them worth keeping around.  Totally agree about the other TODOs you mentioned in your comment above though - it'd be great if we could migrate all the BlobHandler usage onto the filestore.  (Though as you mentioned - those are different tickets for sure.)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2135679557/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2135923942","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2471#issuecomment-2135923942","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2471","id":2135923942,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5_T5zm","user":{"login":"epugh","id":22395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh","html_url":"https://github.com/epugh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-28T19:03:09Z","updated_at":"2024-05-28T19:03:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@AndreyBozhko

For instance, I observed that lots of build failed due to the flaky test cases and looking at history helps, however I did not even knew about this URL before David shared it with me. \r\n\r\nResearch on this:\r\n\r\nAs per one survey participants were asked what information or tools would be most helpful to them in order to better handle flaky test cases, from University of Passau, ([Martin and Gordon, 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00483)).\r\n\r\n> We observe a significant demand for improved visualization of flakiness. They specifically request tools to display test result histories, with comments such as, \"We run tests so often, I often miss the bigger picture\", and a desire for \"a tool to visualize how tests fail and succeed over time\" Additionally, they emphasize that such a tool should include meta-information like \"on which device/environment [the test was executed]\r\n\r\nThe second most commonly stated wish asks for tools that can automatically detect flaky test. And that's I proposed before as well, [2467](https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2467#issuecomment-2122297638),  and you have told me to share it on dev mailing list.

The response would still serialize to the same JSON or XML, but the \"javabin\" now parses a bit differently when received on the client side.  This breaks a class/type expectation baked into the SolrResponseBase getters and triggers the ClassCastException you observed.  This is a known issue right now with 'javabin' and our JAX-RS v2 APIs that we'll need to come up with a fix for at some point, if we decide to keep \"javabin\" in 10.0.\r\n\r\nIt seemed at first like something that'd be easy to workaround, but each thing I tried uncovered a different bug 😬 \r\n\r\n1. The standard workaround would be to ditch V2Request and instead use `FileStoreApi.Upload`, a SolrRequest implementation that's generated for us based on the v2 API definition.  But this didn't work due to [an issue with our generation template](https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2470#issuecomment-2139638871).\r\n2. A solid second-tier workaround would be to modify V2Request usage to use a different response format (e.g. JSON or XML).  But it turns out that [the type/class assumptions made by SolrResponseBase.getStatus also break when JSON or XML are used](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-17316)!  (Note that afaict this error happens any time JSON or XML are used - for any API, either v1 or v2, with or without my recent PR!)\r\n3. Due to an embarrassing little coding error, v2 APIs respond with XML when wt=json is specified 😬 .  I've filed a bug report for this [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-17317)\r\n\r\nLong story short, I intend to fix all these bugs, but I don't want to keep you blocked while I do.  Will revert shortly and then you should be unblocked.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2139661307/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2139909782","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2471#issuecomment-2139909782","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2471","id":2139909782,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5_jG6W","user":{"login":"gerlowskija","id":9030708,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMzA3MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9030708?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija","html_url":"https://github.com/gerlowskija","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-30T15:18:45Z","updated_at":"2024-05-30T15:18:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've reverted my commit on main to get this unblocked, and merged 'main' into the PR branch.

However, looking at \"start\", \"stop\", and \"status\" they have a lot of environment specific logic that I don't feel confident porting over to Java code ;-).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2142295192/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2142359815","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2489#issuecomment-2142359815","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2489","id":2142359815,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5_sdEH","user":{"login":"alessandrobenedetti","id":513195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzE5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessandrobenedetti","html_url":"https://github.com/alessandrobenedetti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessandrobenedetti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessandrobenedetti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessandrobenedetti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessandrobenedetti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessandrobenedetti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessandrobenedetti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessandrobenedetti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessandrobenedetti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessandrobenedetti/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-31T14:28:15Z","updated_at":"2024-05-31T14:28:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"As of today the solution is clean enough to be reviewed and tests are green.\r\nThe usage is intuitive and it should cover many use cases.\r\nPending activities:\r\n- add a new documentation page\r\n- add tests for the distributed scenario","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2142359815/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2142527945","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2405#issuecomment-2142527945","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2405","id":2142527945,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5_tGHJ","user":{"login":"dsmiley","id":377295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzI5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/377295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley","html_url":"https://github.com/dsmiley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-31T15:43:17Z","updated_at":"2024-05-31T15:43:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It doesn't feel right to merge this PR right now.

I'm all for syntactic-sugar, but I wonder whether this is worth the maintenance cost if the main thing that it \"buys\" us is saving people from having to provide the full API path as the \"api\" tool requires?\r\n2. If I'm reading the PR correctly, it looks like one other capability of the proposed `bin/solr stream` tool is that it can evaluate streams \"locally\" in some cases i.e. without a full running Solr.  Which is pretty cool - you could imagine a real super-user doing some pretty involved ETL that builds off of an expression like: `update(techproducts, unique(cat(...)))`.  \r\n\r\n    But I'd worry about some of the documentation challenges surrounding this.  For instance, how would a user know which expressions can be run locally, and which require a Solr to execute on?  For expressions that have a mix of both locally and remotely-executed clauses, is there any way for a user to know which clauses are executed where?\r\n    \r\n    To clarify - I think the upside here _is_ pretty cool, I'm just worried that upside is hard to realize without some extensive work on the documentation end to make it usable by folks in practice.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2145825393/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2146223629","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2491#issuecomment-2146223629","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2491","id":2146223629,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5_7MYN","user":{"login":"dsmiley","id":377295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzI5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/377295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley","html_url":"https://github.com/dsmiley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-03T22:19:43Z","updated_at":"2024-06-03T22:19:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"`org.apache.solr.cloud.TestLeaderElectionZkExpiry` failed due to leaked threads in test (that terminated eventually).

I think the value of the tool is only there if your second comment about being able to run a streaming expression locally is valid, and then having it do what yoru first comment highlights falls out easy, otherwise it really is a thin wrapper/duplication of the `bin/solr api` call.   Especially without any special value add in formatting tuples or error handling etc.\r\n\r\nI do believe the second part is the really cool thing, that I can run a streaming expression locally and use it to process some data.   \r\n\r\nWe clearly need some way of specifying where the processing is happening, in the cluster or locally.   I was trying to think if we have any other places in Solr where we define \"Where am I doing work\" that might provide a name for a parameter.   `bin/solr stream --environment cluster BLAH` ?   The `search()` expression has a `qt` parameter..   `bin/solr stream -qt=/stream BLAH` ?    \r\n\r\nReading through docs more, we have the `parralel()` and it refers to workers.    Maybe the command should be something like `bin/solr stream --workers=local BLAH` which would run on your laptop, and if you don't specify --workers then it runs on the cluster via `/stream`?   \r\n\r\nI have found that lots of streaming expressions don't require a Solr connection, especially during development.  I'm just iterating on the logic, and I'm starting and ending iwth tuples..   it's only later when I get the mappings etc working that I then move to adding in my `search()` or `update()` clauses.\r\n\r\nAlso, as far as docs go, we have a LONG way to go in Streaming expressions.   It's both the best docuemnted code, with all the howtos and guides, but also, I find a million expressions that exist but don't show up in our reference docs ;-).
