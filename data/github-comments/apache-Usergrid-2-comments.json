Made hits against management/token and also <orgname>/<appname> with the previous client id and secret ( but with a new token ) and verified they still worked. Also took the tomcat offline and added in the following line to the properties file. \n\ncassandra.keyspace.application=test_keyspace\n\nI then reran the database/setup and superuser/setup endpoints and created a user with the exact same email as the previous user.

Review notes\n\nThis is a big commit, so here are the key changes to consider.  Many files changed because I moved ApplicationInfo from the services module to the core module, my IDE did some uncalled for formatting (removing trailing spaces) and then I decided to move ApplicationInfo back home to services.\n\nPrimary changes are:\n1) Management app no longer uses redundant \"appinfo\" type Entities, they migrate to application_info\n2) Application Delete and Restore are implemented & available via REST API\n\nHere are some class-by-class details:\n\n## CpEntityManagerFactory\n\nThe main change here is that we no longer create an \"appinfos\" collection and instead rely solely on the \"application_info\" collection created by the ManagementServiceImpl.\n- System App and Default App have been removed completely, they were unused\n- No longer create redundant \"organization\" Entity\n- New impl. of deleteApplication() that saves connections\n- New impl. of restoreApplication() that restores connections\n- lookupAppication(name) uses alias instead of ES\n- migrationOldAppInfos() reads old \"appinfo\" entities and writes \"application_info\" entities.\n- New property usergrid.twodoto.appinfo.migration which defaults to true\n\n## ManagementServiceImpl\n- New impl. of deleteApplication() emf.deleteApplication() that copies connections to the deleted_application_info Entities.\n- New impl. of restoreApplication() calls emf.restoreApplication() to restore the application_info Entity and connections, and then restores token and organization connection.\n\n## ApplicationDeleteTest\n- New and comprehensive app delete and restore tests\n\n## ApplicationsResource (test infrastructure)\n- Represents management ApplicationsResource end-point\n\n## ManagementResponse (test infrastructure)\n- Represents JSON response from management end-points\n\n## AppInfoMigrationPlugin\n\nThis is a plugin to our new Migration Framework (from in the two-dot-o-dev branch).  It reads appinfo Entities from the System App and writes application_info Entities to the Management App.\n\n## JobServiceScheduler\n- Incidental fix: this class still expected MetricsFactory to be available via Spring, but it is now instantiated by Guice.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/usergrid/issues/comments/77878271/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/usergrid/issues/comments/77905289","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/usergrid/pull/178#issuecomment-77905289","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/usergrid/issues/178","id":77905289,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3OTA1Mjg5","user":{"login":"GERey","id":4109659,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMDk2NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4109659?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GERey","html_url":"https://github.com/GERey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GERey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GERey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GERey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GERey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GERey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GERey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GERey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GERey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GERey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-09T17:48:54Z","updated_at":"2015-03-09T17:48:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/USERGRID-465\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/usergrid/issues/comments/77905289/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/usergrid/issues/comments/78114072","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/usergrid/pull/179#issuecomment-78114072","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/usergrid/issues/179","id":78114072,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4MTE0MDcy","user":{"login":"tnine","id":249532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTUzMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/249532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnine","html_url":"https://github.com/tnine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnine/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":true},"created_at":"2015-03-10T18:15:11Z","updated_at":"2015-03-10T18:15:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ready
