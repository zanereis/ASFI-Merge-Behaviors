@kkhatua! Thank you for this contribution, I'd like to help to move it forward. \r\n\r\n> However, I am not sure if we should automatically index any new profile that has been copy-pasted into the root dir.

I think we should consider having Drill only write _new_ profiles to partitioned directories. Any partitioning of historical profiles can be done externally by admins, in my opinion, and we can add examples of \"housekeeping\" scripts for doing that to the Drill documentation.\r\n\r\nWould you like to do any of the following?\r\n\r\n- Resume the work on this PR, I volunteer to be a reviewer.\r\n- Receive a PR from me to your fork here that's rebased and has some changes I think we want.\r\n- You're too busy now, so I'll pull your commits here into a new branch of my own and open a new PR.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nJames","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/1256153990/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/1256165816","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1750#issuecomment-1256165816","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1750","id":1256165816,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAFa5xc5K35G4","user":{"login":"jnturton","id":9107319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMDczMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9107319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton","html_url":"https://github.com/jnturton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-23T12:45:56Z","updated_at":"2022-09-23T12:45:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Or, if we do want to keep this built in ability to partition existing profiles, perhaps we should have it launched from a button on the Profiles page in the web UI instead of on Drillbit startup?

However, in order to enable/disable plugins, the user has to be an admin anyway, so I think it will be ok.   I'd say we should be ok as long as we provide a boot level option to disable it. \r\n\r\n> \r\n> > Another thing to think about is making sure that users can't arbitrarily add this code somehow to a query.\r\n> \r\n> Can't table functions set format config options but not storage config options?\r\n\r\nYou are correct.

Unlike the regular storage plugins, which are pretty self-contained, to use a file system, you have to \"register\" it in the `FileSystemPlugin` class. (See below).   I assumed, perhaps incorrectly, that new file systems had to be in the `java-exec` package.  I'm not a packaging expert, so do you know what we'd have to do in order to move these to `contrib`?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/drill/blob/53e4227650755607db961b758b7966b1d6d4582f/exec/java-exec/src/main/java/org/apache/drill/exec/store/dfs/FileSystemPlugin.java#L93-L96\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/1340938156/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
