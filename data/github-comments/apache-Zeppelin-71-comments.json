(Have been the whole time).  With the exception of bumping to 0.7.0, I successfully run `mvn clean verify` locally on each run of code.  \n\nSince updating to `0.7.0`  running `mvn clean package -Ppyspark` I get the following errors:\n\n```\nTests in error: \n  HeliumApplicationFactoryTest.testUnloadOnInterpreterUnbind:227 ¬ª ClassCast jav...\n  HeliumApplicationFactoryTest.testLoadRunUnloadApplication:145 ¬ª ClassCast java...\n  HeliumApplicationFactoryTest.testUnloadOnInterpreterRestart:272 ¬ª ClassCast ja...\n  HeliumApplicationFactoryTest.testUnloadOnParagraphRemove:189 ¬ª ClassCast java....\n```\n\n**tog** was having similiar issues, (he attached his error log in the original email) [thread](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/e71088130d5e71058890f09fa91df5c1c5111ecb401c63f27a9762a7@%3Cdev.zeppelin.apache.org%3E).  As sugguested by Moon in the thread, I tried building with \n- `mvn clean package`\n- `mvn clean install`\n- `mvn clean package -Pbuild-dist`\n\nAll will yield said error in testing.  Though, I can successfully build and check the cases where the pyspark tests noted above are failing.  (However, even before I was unable to recreate said tests locally).  \n\nSo the several pushes I made yesterday were related to the fact that I am basically flying _quasi_ blind locally. ( I can still `mvn clean package` in the `zeppelin/mahout` directory )\n\nFor brevity I will not re copy and paste, but here is my thought:\n- I never messed with anything in pyspark, or the Zeppelin Server.  \n- Functionality still works full when actually running Zeppelin\n- Thus this is an issue of test configuration.\n\nUpon reviewing the failed tests I noticed, the note_id they are using (which was originally designated for Spark Tests) is the sameone being used by the Mahout tests, even though they are in different interpreter groups. \n\nSo I was attempting to change the note IDs, which is when I got the `null pointer` errors of the last test.  \n\nThat issue I was able to recreate locally, it had to do with not setting `Resource Pool` when creating the context in the MahoutTest. I've fixed that locally and have just pushed.  The fact that this seemingly small oversight was calling failures leads me to believe that the _note_ which Spark Test and Mahout Test are using, are also somehow being used by Zeppelin server, and this mash up being the root of the problem.  \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/231091803/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/231106334","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1146#issuecomment-231106334","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1146","id":231106334,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMTEwNjMzNA==","user":{"login":"Leemoonsoo","id":1540981,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDA5ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1540981?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo","html_url":"https://github.com/Leemoonsoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-07T15:06:06Z","updated_at":"2016-07-07T15:06:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for the fix.\nI have marked fix version 0.6.1 for issue ZEPPELIN-1129.

And how about just use interpreter-setting name as an alias, for simplicity? instead of having both name and alias field.\n\n**Interpreter selection mechanism.**\nThis PR changes current interpreter selection mechanism a lot.\nFor example, if i bind interpreter `%md, %spark (spark, sql), %shell ...` and try to use \n`%sql  select * from table`, then i get `prefix not found`. \n\nI strongly recommend keep compatibility of previous interpreter selection mechanism, because it changes major user experience of Zeppelin.\n\nMy suggestion is, \n1. select interpreter in previous way first. i.e. matching [group].[name] with interpreter selection text.\n2. if there is no matching interpreter, start matching [alias].[name] with interpreter selection text.\n\nwhile [matching rule](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/zeppelin-zengine/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/interpreter/InterpreterFactory.java#L1004) is\n1. if interpreter selection text specify full [group].[name] or [alias].[name], then simply find corresponding interpreter-setting and interpreter.\n2. if interpreter selection text specify just name, first assume [group] or [alias] is omitted.\n3. then assume [name] is omitted.\n\n**Import and change interpreter binding**\n\nIt can be a future work, but i'd like to at least have an direction how we want to handle user experience change expected this PR brings.\n\nBefore\n\n```\n- While Zeppelin instance have the same set of interpreters, imported notebook may run without modification\n- It was possible to quickly change interpreter binding without changing every paragraph. i.e. Bind 'spark-small-cluster' interpreter setting first and then bind 'spark-large-cluster' later without changing interpreter selection text of individual paragraphs\n```\n\nAfter\n\n```\n- If paragraph uses alias for interpreter selection, imported notebook will not able to run unless manually change interpreter selection text for the Zeppelin instance.\n- Once user want to run the same notebook with different interpreter-setting, user need to change interpreter selection text of all paragraphs\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/231210782/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/231211137","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1149#issuecomment-231211137","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1149","id":231211137,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMTIxMTEzNw==","user":{"login":"Leemoonsoo","id":1540981,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDA5ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1540981?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo","html_url":"https://github.com/Leemoonsoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-07T21:21:42Z","updated_at":"2016-07-07T21:21:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I'm
