was fixed for QCOW2 and LVM, back in January or February (unless something has changed since then). It may be fine for RBD, I just wanted to bring it up as a caution. My impression was that there might be an issue with the java bindings, either a bug or a missing call. If I remember correctly, there are two things, there's libvirt managing volumes, and libvirt managing block devices attached to VMs, and they are not the same thing. Resizing a libvirt volume didn't necessarily notify any VM process using that volume of the change, nor resize the block device attached to the live VM. 'virsh blockresize' does this correctly at both the libvirt volume and VM block, though, so we just went back to the script rather than trying to figure out how to patch the java libvirt bindings.\n\nJust make sure the existing behavior is not changed and test that you can stop/start and read/write the root disk fine post a resize.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/104692430/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/104711676","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/291#issuecomment-104711676","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/291","id":104711676,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwNDcxMTY3Ng==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-22T16:51:13Z","updated_at":"2015-05-22T16:51:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[cloudstack-pull-requests

I tested your patch and ran to an issue where a TTY is required to run sudo, but not requested. The host cannot be added.\n\nLogs:\n\n```\n2015-05-24 13:48:44,175 DEBUG [c.c.u.s.SSHCmdHelper] (ApiServer-8:ctx-0b7d379a ctx-5e04fa3a) sudo cloudstack-setup-agent  -m 192.168.22.61 -z 1 -p 1 -c 1 -g 57acd541-cd37-34ea-af6a-dc6ecd007325 -a --pubNic=cloudbr0 --prvNi\nc=cloudbr0 --guestNic=cloudbr0 --hypervisor=kvm output:sudo: sorry, you must have a tty to run sudo\n```\n\nBecause it always uses 'sudo' you cannot add a host as 'root' nor as other user. To test:\n\n```\n[root@cs1 ~]# ssh root@kvm1 sudo whoami\nroot@kvm1's password: \nsudo: sorry, you must have a tty to run sudo\n```\n\nTwo possible solutions:\n1. Specify -t parameter or similar to request a TTY:\n\n```\n[root@cs1 ~]# ssh -t root@kvm1 sudo whoami\nroot@kvm1's password: \nroot\nConnection to kvm1 closed.\n```\n\nI prefer this solution since we then solve it on the CloudStack side. Alternatively, one can remove the TTY requirement from /etc/sudoers file:\n\n```\nDefaults    requiretty\n```\n\nI've continued my tests with altering the /etc/sudoers file and then I can add the host as user 'root' again, and also as user 'cloud' that I added to the /etc/sudoers file to allow it root without a password.\n\nResult:\n\n```\n[root@kvm2 ~]# ps aux | grep cloud\nroot     23044  0.7  0.0 133128  4748 ?

It's a huge step forward to have a single user who only has access to run cloudstack-setup-agent. Perhaps you don't have the same root everywhere, but you don't have to have the same non-root user/password everywhere, either. You can even remove/disable this user after the host is added.\n\nIn addition, many places don't allow root to SSH as a basic infosec policy. \n\nI'd like us to get out of the business of dictating  and conflicting with configuration management, where possible, including things suggested like changing passwords upon agent setup. These things will rub big shops who have their config management story together the wrong way, and we already do way too much (like touching iptables and libvirt settings) IMO. They also confuse newbies more than they help (\"why can't I log in anymore?\", and I've heard a lot of \"why did my networking get screwed up and restart?\" from the existing setups scripts).\n\nAlso re: agent listening, I don't think  we want the agent to listen. It has been a huge boon to have all ports closed on the hypervisor except SSH, everywhere I've gone, from an infosec standpoint. I'm also not sure there's a meaningful gain by having the mgmt server contact the host via a listening agent port vs contacting the host via SSH and a user who has no access other than to run setup. I'm also more confident that SSH would pass a penetration test.\n\nAn easy fix that I think would accommodate everyone at this point is to only use 'sudo' if the user passed in is not 'root'. Then everyone doing it the current way is unaffected by the sudo and requiretty, and people who want to only pass non-root credentials to cloudstack mgmt server can do that as well with a sudoers line for cloudstack-agent-setup and a -t for the sudo (or perhaps just document the requiretty along with the sudoers line).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/105133656/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/105136127","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/285#issuecomment-105136127","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/285","id":105136127,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwNTEzNjEyNw==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-25T05:57:50Z","updated_at":"2015-05-25T05:57:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[cloudstack-pull-requests #224](https://builds.apache.org/job/cloudstack-pull-requests/224/) SUCCESS\nThis pull request looks good\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/105136127/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/105173698","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/288#issuecomment-105173698","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/288","id":105173698,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwNTE3MzY5OA==","user":{"login":"remibergsma","id":1630096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzAwOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1630096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma","html_url":"https://github.com/remibergsma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-25T09:05:26Z","updated_at":"2015-05-25T09:05:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm focussing on getting this sorted out so we can merge.\n\n@mlsorensen I like the idea of not changing anything in case the username is 'root'. \n\nDid some reading on 'require tty' security implications and I'm quite sure it doesn't matter much in our case. We could as well just document it then.\n\nTo wrap it up:\n- Let's make sure sudo is NOT prepended when the username equals 'root'. This way we ensure the current behaviour is unchanged and does not require sudo\n- Since we require a sudo config anyway, let's document it properly.
