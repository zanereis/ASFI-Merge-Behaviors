I don't know that I can speak for every backend but cpu, cuda, opencl I can do this for.\r\n\r\nA stream is a method of serializing commands.  This means that streams on the CPU may be bound to actual CPU streams; an abstraction I have used in the past with success; it means the cpu device semantics (and error conditions) match closer to the GPU than if the CPU has no threads or implements them in other ways.  For instance not synchronizing between streams correctly when doing memory transfer will appear to mis-behave similarly on both cpu and gpu *if* the cpu streams are actually based on actual threads.\r\n\r\nWhat I don't know is how this compares to webassembly or opengl.  I think (the stream abstraction) also maps pretty precisely to vulkan but I would have to research it.  As long as the changes are additive and thought out then perhaps we can use the device attribute system to indicate what is exposed and what is not; then code can choose how to react if the new api isn't there for some different backend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about the API presented here:\r\n\r\n```clojure\r\n(defprotocol PStream\r\n  \"Basic functionality expected of streams.  Streams are an abstraction of a stream of execution\r\nand can be synchonized with the host or with each other using events.\"\r\n  (copy-host->device [stream host-buffer device-buffer byte-count])\r\n  (copy-device->host [stream device-buffer host-buffer byte-count])\r\n  (copy-device->device [stream dev-a dev-b byte-count])\r\n  (create-event [stream]\r\n    \"Create an event for synchronization.  The event is triggered when the stream\r\nexecutes to the event.\")\r\n  (sync-event [stream event]\r\n    \"Have this stream pause until a given event is triggered.\"))\r\n\r\n(defprotocol PEvent\r\n  (wait-for-event [event]\r\n    \"Wait on the host until an event is triggered.\"))\r\n\r\n(defprotocol PDevice\r\n  (memory-info [device]\r\n    \"Get a map of {:free <long> :total <long>} describing the free and total memory in bytes.\")\r\n  (create-stream [device]\r\n    \"Create a stream of execution.  Streams are independent threads of execution.  They can be synchronized with each other and the main thread using events.\")\r\n  (allocate-device-buffer [device byte-count]\r\n    \"Allocate a device buffer.  This is the generic unit of data storage used for computation.\")\r\n  (free-device-buffer [buf-ptr]))\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think not all of it is required and the interfaces exposed allow me to do 90% of this already, just in a somewhat more tedious way.  \r\n\r\nWe can discuss more of this later; at the end of the day I need to know:\r\n1.  cpu streams...threads ok?\r\n2.  stream-to-stream event synchronization?

I can see now, however, that openGL and maybe not vulcan and who knows in the future.  Do you know offhand how many backends are not word-addressable?  I see now the byte-offset mechanism is a way to work around something like an openGL buffer handle; thank you for that I had not realized this.\r\n\r\nI am not certain that we want to expose the device API yet and I don't want expose an API that later we decide was a mistake so if I could have just a little more of your time.  I will then go off and make it happen.\r\n\r\nHere is the API for the tech.compute low level compute system:\r\n```clojure\r\n(defprotocol PStream\r\n  \"Basic functionality expected of streams.  Streams are an abstraction of a stream of execution\r\nand can be synchonized with the host or with each other using events.\"\r\n  (copy-host->device [stream host-buffer host-offset\r\n                      device-buffer device-offset elem-count])\r\n  (copy-device->host [stream device-buffer device-offset\r\n                      host-buffer host-offset elem-count])\r\n  (copy-device->device [stream dev-a dev-a-off dev-b dev-b-off elem-count])\r\n  (memset [stream device-buffer device-offset elem-val elem-count])\r\n  (create-event [stream]\r\n    \"Create an event for synchronization.  The event is triggered when the stream\r\nexecutes to the event.\")\r\n  (sync-event [stream event]\r\n    \"Have this stream pause until a given event is triggered.\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\nEven without exposing a buffer offset mechanism, the copy operations allow for datatype-sized offsets and an element count.\r\n\r\nHere is the device API analogue and it matches roughly above with the exception that every backend for tvm now has to have logic to divine if it is a host->device or device->host or device->device operation:\r\n\r\n```C++\r\nvirtual void CopyDataFromTo(const void* from,\r\n                              size_t from_offset,\r\n                              void* to,\r\n                              size_t to_offset,\r\n                              size_t size,\r\n                              TVMContext ctx_from,\r\n                              TVMContext ctx_to,\r\n                              TVMStreamHandle stream) = 0;\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is the runtime api (comments elided):\r\n```C\r\nTVM_DLL int TVMArrayCopyFromBytes(TVMArrayHandle handle,\r\n                                  void* data,\r\n                                  size_t nbytes);\r\nTVM_DLL int TVMArrayCopyToBytes(TVMArrayHandle handle,\r\n                                void* data,\r\n                                size_t nbytes);\r\nTVM_DLL int TVMArrayCopyFromTo(TVMArrayHandle from,\r\n                               TVMArrayHandle to,\r\n                               TVMStreamHandle stream);\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo looking at this I see 5 things relevant to this discussion:\r\n\r\n1.  The device API matches the compute stream api...because compute streams operate at the same level as the device.\r\n2.  No stream parameter in either array copy to or array copy from.  This I believe is an oversight; for cuda at least the stream is very important and using a null stream means you are using the default stream which enforces blocking semantics that are absolutely not optimal, especially if you are copying several separate things.\r\n3.  No offset provided to allow copying sub-portions of data.\r\n4.  No byte count provided to allow copying sub-portions of data.\r\n5.  No formal access to the byte_offset mechanism we were talking about above.  In fact, searching the codebase I don't see it being assigned to often but I do see it being used in computation.\r\n\r\nGiven the above, it does seem to me that exposing the lower level device API to the the jvm runtime is the most logical option.  The alternative would be adding new copy from/to functions for arrays that look like clumsier, more verbose versions of the device api.\r\n  \r\nWhat do you think about this line of reasoning?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/370273460/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/370287626","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/959#issuecomment-370287626","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/959","id":370287626,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MDI4NzYyNg==","user":{"login":"cnuernber","id":40426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNDI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnuernber","html_url":"https://github.com/cnuernber","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnuernber/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnuernber/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnuernber/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnuernber/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnuernber/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnuernber/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnuernber/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnuernber/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnuernber/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-05T01:49:27Z","updated_at":"2018-03-05T01:49:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closing this.

TVM is designed to be flexible on that, and we could possibly come up with a operator def like those in scan.\r\n\r\nSupporting arbitrary index scan order, however, can have impact on bound inference and workload partitioning on GPU.

The idea is that the Buffer is a symbolic definition of the Tensor. It does not have to correspond to a real Tensor object that has strides, but instead it only declares how the variables maps to the Tensor object.
