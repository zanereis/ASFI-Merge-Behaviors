Pushing the exception to sender thread is an option. We can probably do this to UnauthorizedTopicException and maybe RecordSizeTooLargeException as well. I actually feel it is a little hacky that we let the producer to form a RecordSizeTooLargeException which is an ApiException. Maybe we should consider replacing it with something like IllegalArgumentException.\n\nRegarding the TimeoutException, we are actually mixing the usage of timeout exception for two different purposes. 1) the client cannot finish something in time, it may or may not be related to the broker. 2) the broker tells the clients that it cannot finish something in time.\n\nIn case 1) it does not make sense to push the exception to the sender thread because the it is purely a client side decision. In case 2) we want to let the sender thread to handle the exception. Currently case 2) is only applicable to ProduceRequest which expect the replication to be finished within a given time. \nI think we should decouple those two. \n\nFrom what I understand, what we want here is not let callback to handle all the ApiException, it is about letting the callback handle the ApiExceptions related to the ProduceRequest and related TopicMetadataRequest. I feel a few issues we have seen in producer and consumer came from our bad exception hierarchy. e.g. a retriable exception doesn't have to be an ApiException. Maybe we should consider to use an abstract exception instead of complicated hierarchy. Something like:\n\n```\npublic abstract class KafkaException  {\nboolean isTriable();\nboolean isApiException();\nboolean isMetadataException();\n...\n}\n```\n\nThis will give us much more freedom to handle exceptions correctly.\n\nFor this particular issue, I am thinking maybe can do the following:\n1. Create a RequestTimeoutException extends from RetriableException. This exception will only be passed to the callback.\n2. Let TimeoutException extend from KafkaException and this exception can be thrown to the user threads.\n3. Push TopicAuthorizationException to the sender thread.\n4. Replace RecordSizeTooLargeException with IllegalArgumentException.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/196100578/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/196248047","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1051#issuecomment-196248047","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1051","id":196248047,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5NjI0ODA0Nw==","user":{"login":"enothereska","id":14234336,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjM0MzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14234336?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska","html_url":"https://github.com/enothereska","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-14T10:36:56Z","updated_at":"2016-03-14T19:00:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ijuma @ewencp @granders could you have a look, thanks.

With a brief search through code reviews and discussions I couldn't find why it was changed. \n\n@MayureshGharat @jjkoshy Can you help provide some insight?\n\nIf this was intended to be changed, this patch should update the docs and include a warning in the 0.9 upgrade notes. Otherwise we may want to change back to a value of `true` (as this PR currently does)\n\nCurrently the block.on.buffer.full docs read as follows:\n\n> When our memory buffer is exhausted we must either stop accepting new records (block) or throw errors. **By default this setting is true** and we block, however in some scenarios blocking is not desirable and it is better to immediately give an error. Setting this to false will accomplish that: the producer will throw a BufferExhaustedException if a recrord is sent and the buffer space is full.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/196324898/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/196325251","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1058#issuecomment-196325251","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1058","id":196325251,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5NjMyNTI1MQ==","user":{"login":"granthenke","id":1928566,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Mjg1NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1928566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke","html_url":"https://github.com/granthenke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-14T14:15:18Z","updated_at":"2016-03-14T14:15:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@ijuma I was typing up a comment to start the discussion.

I agree that it is all about how to make it easy for user to handle the exceptions. But I think having exceptions with \"similar\" names but clear meaning is much better than shoehoning seemingly same exceptions into one exception but conveying wrong information. \n\nIn ApiException, error code 7 (Request Timeout) has a very clear meaning about what happened: the broker had to send back a produce response before the message is successfully replicated because the request timeout in the produce request has reached. On the client side, we map this error code to TimeoutException.\n\nCurrently we are re-purposing this TimeoutException for all the other cases where a timeout is needed on the client side. I think separating TimeoutException and RequestTimeoutException make it very clear that TimeoutException is not an ApiException returned by broker, but simply means the client cannot finish something in time. It is just a client side exception.
