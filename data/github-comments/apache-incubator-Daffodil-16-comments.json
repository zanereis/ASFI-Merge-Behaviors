This is very consistent with one particular array (delimiters member in DelimiterStackParser) but not 100%. And I cannot ever reproduce this behavior (non-reference equal things serialized to reference equal things) in any other cases, even with arrays of the same type.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI wrote a test scala file that serialized an object containing zero length arrays in different ways (i.e sometimes have reference equaltiy, sometimes uniquely allocated and not having reference equality) , looked that serialization dump, and confirmed that my interpretation was correct. An array that has reference equality to a previously serialized array looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfieldName\r\n  (array)\r\n    TC_REFERENCE - 0x71\r\n      Handle - 8258634 - 0x00 7e 04 4a\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut an array does not have reference equality serializes to this:\r\n```\r\nfieldName\r\n  (array)\r\n    TC_ARRAY - 0x75\r\n      TC_REFERENCE - 0x71\r\n        Handle - 8258633 - 0x00 7e 04 49\r\n      newHandle 0x00 7e 04 c6\r\n      Array size - 0 - 0x00 00 00 00\r\n    Values\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the first case the TC_REFERENCE is to the pre-serialized array, in the second case the TC_REFERENCE is to the type since the type is the same, but it's a completely separate array.\r\n\r\nWhat's confusing is that I've confirmed that none of the serialized delimiter arrays have reference equality when they are created. They are all separately allocated arrays. But when inspecting the serialized dump, the zero length arrays do have reference equality. I've also confirmed that when deserializing the arrays do have reference equality. I've also confirmed the fields do not have reference equality when the serialization function writeObject() is called. So it must be somewhere in the actual serialization code (i.e. ObjectOutputStream.defaultWriteObject) doing this optimization.\r\n\r\nWhat's also weird is I add a new (unused) member to a non-delimiter parser and allocated zero-length `Array[DelimterParseEv]` and those were not changed at all during serialization. They all stayed separately allocated arrays without reference equality. So whatever is doing this optimization doesn't do it in this case. But it almost always does it for the delimiters field in the `DelimiterStackParser`, but not 100%.\r\n\r\nSeems like some kind of deep Java optimization to save some bytes during serialization, but it is not very consistent. I'm also surprised Java is even allowed to do that. Changing something to have reference equality seems like it could potentially break things if something relied things having meaning if they when not reference equal.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/2334007707/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/2334828017","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/1286#issuecomment-2334828017","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/1286","id":2334828017,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhBG1s6LKqXx","user":{"login":"mbeckerle","id":1524099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1524099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle","html_url":"https://github.com/mbeckerle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-06T21:21:52Z","updated_at":"2024-09-06T21:21:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I suggest just comment out the test, put comments in there pointing to this issue discussion, or exerpt from this in comments there, and then commit the commented out test.

The best I found find is a conversation I had with ChatGPT where it claims there are JVM optimizations where it will sometimes convert zero-length arrays to singletons. I can't find any actual references to this, and sometimes ChatGPT gave conflicting responses, so I'm not sure how much I trust it, but it does explain what I am seeing and was what I suspected was happening. It's still odd that is does this optimization very consistently in one specific place, and no where else that I see, but I guess optimizations can be odd and hard to predict.\r\n\r\nAssuming this is the actual issue, I think we probably need to comment out this test since it sometimes leads to CI failures. It also means reproducibility in saved parsers is not guarantee, but it is at least much better with this change, so I still think it's worth adding. If this becomes a priority in the future, we can investigate alternative serialization mechanisms that are more reproducible.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/2338496960/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/2338888858","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/1276#issuecomment-2338888858","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/1276","id":2338888858,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhBG1s6LaJya","user":{"login":"dependabot[bot]","id":49699333,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDk2OTkzMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/29110?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/dependabot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-09T19:14:00Z","updated_at":"2024-09-09T19:14:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Superseded

sure if this is much better, but here's an alterantive approach that just uses JUnit:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n/** Defined in the a test library **/\r\ntrait EasyTestSuite {\r\n  implicit protected val _name: TestName = new TestName()\r\n  @Rule def name = _name\r\n \r\n  def doTest(runner: Runner)(implicit name: TestName): Unit = {\r\n    runner.runOneTest(name.getMethodName)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n/** the actual test suite **/\r\nclass TestSuite extends EasyTestSuite {\r\n  @Test def test1(): Unit = doTest(runner)\r\n  @Test def test2(): Unit = doTest(runner)\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAccomplishes something similar, though not exactly the same.\r\n\r\nThe biggest drawbacks are:\r\n1. it requires extending `EasyTestSuite` but I think that's the only source change aside from switching to doTest\r\n2. daffodil-tdml doesn't currently depend on JUnit (none of jars actually depnd on Junit except as a test dependency), so it's not clear where `EasyTestSuite` would live. We would maybe need to add a new jar (e.g. daffodil-tdml-junit), which would define this new trait as well as a dependency to daffodil-tdml-lib. So schema projects would need to add this new dependency, but really we woudl probably just update daffodil-sbt to depend on this for newer version of daffodil.\r\n\r\nMaybe another consideration with either approach, is it can't be used with older versions of `daffodilVersion` in daffodil-sbt. Makes me wonder if really this wants to be a feature of daffodil-sbt so whatever adds this capability, daffodil-sbt an do it for all versions of Daffodil. So instead of update daffodil to get this capability, you just update daffodil-sbt?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/2484154727/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/2489396874","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/1374#issuecomment-2489396874","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/1374","id":2489396874,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhBG1s6UYS6K","user":{"login":"dependabot[bot]","id":49699333,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDk2OTkzMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/29110?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/dependabot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-20T19:35:25Z","updated_at":"2024-11-20T19:35:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Superseded

It's getting difficult to deal with merge conflicts each time a new commit adds tests, so if this second commit could get two +1's I would prefer if this be merged before anything else.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/2554839341/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/2557671721","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/1397#issuecomment-2557671721","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/1397","id":2557671721,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhBG1s6Ycvkp","user":{"login":"mbeckerle","id":1524099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1524099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle","html_url":"https://github.com/mbeckerle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-12-20T20:24:26Z","updated_at":"2024-12-20T20:24:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> +1\r\n> \r\n> Saving the 4.0.0 for the change in Scala version?\r\n\r\nCorrect","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/2557671721/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/2557689343","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/1396#issuecomment-2557689343","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/1396","id":2557689343,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhBG1s6Ycz3_","user":{"login":"mbeckerle","id":1524099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1524099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle","html_url":"https://github.com/mbeckerle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-12-20T20:40:37Z","updated_at":"2024-12-20T20:40:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"All tests pass on my system.
