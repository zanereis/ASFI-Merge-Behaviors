we should be able to stream out all currently present data in addition to what will arrive later.\r\n\r\nAgreed, but I think it would be easier to start from a particular snapshot for now, and add the ability to process all existing data as a follow-up.\r\n\r\n> we need to take into account that files in the current snapshot could be added by already expired snapshots and we might not have metadata for those snapshots.\r\n\r\nYes. To start with, I'd recommend ordering partition tuples and processing a partition at a time. Partitions are often time-based and correlated with the write pattern, so this approach will probably provide a smooth transition to from partitions to snapshots.\r\n\r\n> We can have a config per operation or a list of allowed operations.\r\n\r\nThis proposal sounds good to me. For overwrite, it seems like we will need a delta format to express what happened to a row as well as to pass the row contents.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/555696946/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/555699617","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/587#issuecomment-555699617","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/587","id":555699617,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NTY5OTYxNw==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-19T20:32:07Z","updated_at":"2019-11-19T20:32:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks

@rdblue, I simplified the reader implementation taking into account all your suggestions.\r\n\r\nListing a few of changes:\r\n\r\n- removed the java types map and used `Object.class`\r\n- added back the `convert` method with support for `null`\r\n- switched to field id indexing instead of field name\r\n- removed the column sort/ordering\r\n\r\nPlease have another look when you have time.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/558173144/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/558211852","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/520#issuecomment-558211852","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/520","id":558211852,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1ODIxMTg1Mg==","user":{"login":"prodeezy","id":1474591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzQ1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1474591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prodeezy","html_url":"https://github.com/prodeezy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prodeezy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prodeezy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prodeezy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prodeezy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prodeezy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prodeezy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prodeezy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prodeezy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prodeezy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-25T15:41:24Z","updated_at":"2019-11-25T15:41:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@anjalinorwood
