I created a process group with an unreferenced controller service. Then, I copy/pasted the PG. The new PG did not contain the unreferenced controller service.\r\n\r\nNext, I rebased this PR branch to current main because I was having build issues on my platform with source code from pre-1.19.0. Performed a full build with unit tests successfully.\r\n\r\nI installed NiFi and attempted to reproduce the copy/paste problem. The pasted PG correctly contained the unreferenced controller service.\r\n\r\nAlso, I noted the same problem exists when creating a template in 1.18.0; an unreferenced CS is not in the template. Confirmed by usage and by inspecting exported template XML. With this bug fix, the template correctly includes the unreferenced CS.\r\n\r\nThanks for the fix @NissimShiman !\r\n\r\n+1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1332496182/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1332565542","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6731#issuecomment-1332565542","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/6731","id":1332565542,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5PbVYm","user":{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-30T18:23:46Z","updated_at":"2022-11-30T18:23:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @greyp9 .

Namely that:\r\n- If we encounter an empty array in the first record, we have no way of knowing the type of elements.\r\n- If we just decide to use STRING as the type like we previously did, this can cause problems because:\r\n      - Anything can be coerced into a STRING.\r\n      - If we later encounter an array of Records there, we end up inferring that as a STRING\r\n      - So we end up converting the Record objects into STRINGs\r\n- Instead, we create an Array where the element type is null\r\n- We then consider ARRAY[x] wider than ARRAY[null] for any x (other than null)\r\n- We then have to wait until the very end, after making inferences based on all data\r\n- At that point if the type is still inferred to be null we can just change it to a STRING\r\n\r\nIn short, code looks great but needs a bit of documentation :)\r\nOtherwise I'm a +1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1341077872/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1341266254","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6763#issuecomment-1341266254","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/6763","id":1341266254,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5P8hlO","user":{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-07T16:50:41Z","updated_at":"2022-12-07T16:50:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mattyb149 I actually just encountered an issue with another test.

However, the change needs to be implemented in a way that maintains compatibility with the current implementation.\r\n> \r\n> Introducing a new configuration property named something like `Authentication Strategy`, with initial options including `Request Parameters` and `Basic Authentication` would provide a way to introduce support without breaking existing implementations.\r\n> \r\n> One other note, `OAuth2TokenProviderImpl` is deprecated, so it does not need to be changed.\r\n\r\nHey, thanks for your feedback! Indeed the implementation is not _technically_ backwards compatible, BUT assuming that all auth servers support Basic authentication (as mandated by the RFC), then this should not be a breaking change. Of course if you worry that there might be some auth servers that do not support Basic authentication or they only support some other form of client authentication, then we should probably implement that using the aforementioned `Authentication Strategy` option. Though I feel like this implementation is most aligned with the RFC and should, by all accounts, be the default strategy.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1352667572/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1353410957","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6779#issuecomment-1353410957","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/6779","id":1353410957,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5Qq2mN","user":{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-15T17:04:47Z","updated_at":"2022-12-15T17:04:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"So I crated a two-node nifi cluster using GKE to test this.

Overall it looks good to me, except the last commit:\r\n> \r\n> > Fix constant IOException in onTrigger() when DistributedMapCache has no entries\r\n> \r\n> So there was an issue when `DistributedMapCache` was used (I tested it with Hazelcast cache and did not run into it). I debugged it a bit and the root cause seems to be that `GenericObjectSerDe.deserialize()` should handle empty byte arrays. Like in [CacheValueDeserializer](https://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/78be613a0f85b664695ea2cbfaf26163f9b8e454/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-standard-bundle/nifi-standard-processors/src/main/java/org/apache/nifi/processors/standard/FetchDistributedMapCache.java#L287-L296). Please fix it in the deserializer instead of cacthing the exception in `onTrigger()`.\r\n> \r\n> There are also other changes in the last commit whose purpose is unclear for me: `stateBackup` handling and moving the fetcher creation into `onTrigger()` instead of `onScheduled()`. If there is no good reason for them, I would suggest reverting the whole commit and adding the `GenericObjectSerDe` fix only.\r\n\r\n@turcsanyip Done.

The corresponding command was not being removed from the `roleCommands` Map, which was preventing proper registration on cluster reconnection. I corrected this behavior and also corrected the Role ID resolution prior to calling `findLeader()`.\r\n\r\nIn addition to those changes, I removed the `withReleaseOnCancel()` setting from the Leader Elector Builder. This was a more recent addition to the Kubernetes Client library implementation. The purpose of the setting is to update the Lease will a null holder identity, prompting nodes to attempt lease renewal. For the purpose of NiFi clustering, this behavior does not seem necessary, as NiFi nodes will proceed with attempting to update and obtain a lease lock. Removing the release on cancel setting avoids the error shown above while allowing standard lease lock update attempts to proceed.\r\n\r\nThese changes resulted in consistent behavior with various disconnect and reconnect attempts.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1356057372/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1356225450","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6782#issuecomment-1356225450","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/6782","id":1356225450,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5Q1luq","user":{"login":"MikeThomsen","id":108184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODE4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen","html_url":"https://github.com/MikeThomsen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-17T11:56:50Z","updated_at":"2022-12-17T11:56:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@exceptionfactory took a deeper look at the change, and it's backward compatible so I'm not -1 anymore.

Thanks for the contribution @ChrisSamo632, this looks like a useful improvement.\r\n> \r\n> One implementation note, rather defining instances of `AllowableValue`, what do you think about creating two new `enum` definitions, named `SearchResultFormat` and `AggregationResultFormat`, both of which could implement `DescribedValue`. This approach supports using the `enum` name as the property value, and makes value handling and comparison a bit more straightforward.\r\n\r\n@exceptionfactory sounds sensible.

It does seem to indicate though the only path for correctly redirecting messages from xsl:message is to use custom Saxon code with the use of MessageWarner as you had mentioned previously.\r\nBTW I believe the code I had in setMessageReceiver essentially mimicked MessageWarner as MessageWarner extends net.sf.saxon.serialize.XMLEmitter.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1359922428/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1359924493","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6685#issuecomment-1359924493","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/6685","id":1359924493,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5RDs0N","user":{"login":"markobean","id":16822728,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODIyNzI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16822728?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean","html_url":"https://github.com/markobean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-20T18:04:23Z","updated_at":"2022-12-20T18:04:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Reminder @joewitt - I did not merge because I am not a committer.\r\n\r\nAs far as unit tests, it  may be reasonable to add, but this feels more like an integration testing option.  And might begin to go down the rabbit hole. If we add a test for this, do we also add a test to ensure all processors are copied with the process group? child process groups? funnels? etc. \r\n\r\n@NissimShiman If you think adding a unit test for the copy operation is reasonable, is it also reasonable to have each component type tested?\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1359924493/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
