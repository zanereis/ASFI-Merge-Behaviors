Also, there was a severe bug found in `ComputerVerificationStrategy` that has since been rectified (a profile test exposed it).\n\nCHANGELOG\n\n```\n* Fixed a bug around profiling and nested traversals.\n```\n\nVOTE +1.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/199883620/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/199886276","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/273#issuecomment-199886276","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/273","id":199886276,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5OTg4NjI3Ng==","user":{"login":"okram","id":148925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODkyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/148925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram","html_url":"https://github.com/okram","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-22T16:14:47Z","updated_at":"2016-03-22T16:14:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Here is the complete branch: https://github.com/apache/incubator-tinkerpop/tree/TINKERPOP-1199\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/199886276/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/199907006","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/271#issuecomment-199907006","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/271","id":199907006,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5OTkwNzAwNg==","user":{"login":"okram","id":148925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODkyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/148925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram","html_url":"https://github.com/okram","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-22T17:00:01Z","updated_at":"2016-03-22T17:00:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Reviewed code as best I could given my knowledge of GraphSON serialization.

You added to `traversal.asciidoc`, you created a `GroovyOptionalTest` and an `OptionalTest`. Your test cases good. Finally, you were smart about adding `__.optional()`. Did my `GraphTraversalTest` open your eyes :) ?. \n\nPlease make sure the docs build. Better yet, `publish-docs.sh` after your `process-docs.sh` and then we can all see the new section online. Finally, please do a full integration test. If you can paste your `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` console output of your integration test run, that would be great.  After that, I will vote.\n\nThank you

Sorry i forgot to actually make the change.\n\nThe assembly files were incorrect from the start since it only includes \"compile\" dependencies meaning \"runtime\" dependencies (which didn't exist before) were left out. I made the slf4j impl/log4j runtime or test dependencies since they're not required to compile (and users of the library can use any slf4j impl, not just log4j, i.e. me and Spring Boot prefer logback), which \"breaks\" the assemblies assumption. So the assemblies need to be updated to include both compile and runtime dependencies.\n\nI'll go back to this later.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/205253990/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/205254283","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/263#issuecomment-205254283","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/263","id":205254283,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNTI1NDI4Mw==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-04T11:28:14Z","updated_at":"2016-04-04T11:28:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ceefour

The Neo4j API documentation doesn't really say much about which of these methods can fail and in which ways. I figured that if either one of those fail then the transaction should be considered dead. From looking through the implementations when I was trying to figure out what was going on, I saw that success() and failure() just set a boolean flag so they shouldn't fail.
