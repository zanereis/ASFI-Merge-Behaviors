somewhat late on this but just in case someone is having the same problem. You *can* get the symbols for specific internal layers via the `[[` operator. So, for example, if your internals look like this:\r\n\r\n~~~R\r\ninternals <- model$symbol$get.internals()\r\ninternals$outputs\r\n# [1] \"data\"                    \"fullyconnected27_weight\" \"fullyconnected27_bias\"   \"fullyconnected27_output\" \"fullyconnected28_weight\" \"fullyconnected28_bias\"  \r\n# [7] \"fullyconnected28_output\"\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nthen `internals[[1]]` creates the symbol for `\"data\"`, `internals[[2]]` for `\"fullyconnected27_weight\"` and so on.\r\n\r\nThat said, this is not enough in order to access the internal predictions like in [the Python notebook](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/master/example/notebooks/predict-with-pretrained-model.ipynb). This is because the R implementation of `mx.model.FeedForward.create` always trains a model (so you can't reuse a symbol from a previous model like that).\r\n\r\nInstead, what I have tried is to create a modified version of the [`predict.MXFeedForwardModel`](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/master/R-package/R/model.R#L473) function, which attempts to pass the necessary arguments to `mx.simple.bind` and `mx.exec.update.arg.arrays` so that only the layers upto the selected `layer` are used, and the outputs of the selected one are returned. Basically you should only need to manage which elements of `model$symbol$get.internals()$outputs` and `model$arg.params` are used inside the calls.\r\n\r\n~~~R\r\npredictInternal <- function(model, X, ctx=NULL, layer, array.batch.size=128, array.layout=\"auto\") {\r\n  # initialization stuff I probably don't care about ---------------------------\r\n  if (is.null(ctx)) ctx <- mxnet:::mx.ctx.default()\r\n  if (is.array(X) || is.matrix(X)) {\r\n    if (array.layout == \"auto\") {\r\n      array.layout <- mxnet:::mx.model.select.layout.predict(X, model)\r\n    }\r\n    if (array.layout == \"rowmajor\") {\r\n      X <- t(X)\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  # end initialization ---------------------------------------------------------\r\n  # iterator creation ----------------------------------------------------------\r\n  ## X iterates through the batches of input data\r\n  X <- mxnet:::mx.model.init.iter(X, NULL, batch.size=array.batch.size, is.train=FALSE)\r\n  X$reset()\r\n  if (!X$iter.next()) stop(\"Cannot predict on empty iterator\")\r\n  dlist = X$value()\r\n  # end iterator creation ------------------------------------------------------\r\n  # executor creation ----------------------------------------------------------\r\n  ## mx.simple.bind defined in https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/master/R-package/R/executor.R#L5\r\n  ## internally calls mx.symbol.bind, defined in https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/master/R-package/src/executor.cc#L191\r\n  ### see also: https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/e7514fe1b3265aaf15870b124bb6ed0edd82fa76/R-package/demo/basic_executor.R\r\n  # pexec <- mxnet:::mx.simple.bind(model$symbol, ctx=ctx, data=dim(dlist$data), grad.req=\"null\")\r\n  internals <- model$symbol$get.internals()\r\n  pexec <- mxnet:::mx.simple.bind(internals[[1 + 3 * layer]], ctx=ctx, data=dim(dlist$data), grad.req=\"null\")\r\n  # end executor creation ------------------------------------------------------\r\n  # set up arg arrays ----------------------------------------------------------\r\n  internalArgParams <- model$arg.params[1:(2 * layer)]\r\n  # print(names(internalArgParams))\r\n\r\n  mxnet:::mx.exec.update.arg.arrays(pexec, internalArgParams, match.name=T)\r\n  mxnet:::mx.exec.update.aux.arrays(pexec, model$aux.params, match.name=T)\r\n  # end set up arg arrays ------------------------------------------------------\r\n  # the rest is left untouched -------------------------------------------------\r\n  packer <- mxnet:::mx.nd.arraypacker()\r\n  X$reset()\r\n  while (X$iter.next()) {\r\n    dlist = X$value()\r\n    mxnet:::mx.exec.update.arg.arrays(pexec, list(data=dlist$data), match.name=T)\r\n    mxnet:::mx.exec.forward(pexec, is.train=FALSE)\r\n    out.pred <- mxnet:::mx.nd.copyto(pexec$ref.outputs[[1]], mxnet:::mx.cpu())\r\n    padded <- X$num.pad()\r\n    oshape <- dim(out.pred)\r\n    ndim <- length(oshape)\r\n    packer$push(mxnet:::mx.nd.slice(out.pred, 0, oshape[[ndim]] - padded))\r\n  }\r\n  X$reset()\r\n  return(packer$get())\r\n}\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nUsage of this function, assuming we have a previously trained `model` and we want to get the outputs of the third hidden layer:\r\n\r\n~~~R\r\npredictInternal(model, trainX, layer = 3, array.layout = \"colmajor\", array.batch.size = 1)\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nI have tested this and works for my example case (but I don't have a toy example just yet). However it will not work for all cases, only for pretty specific and simple networks.
