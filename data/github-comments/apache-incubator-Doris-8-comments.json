In my opinion, it is quite intuitive to enable partition discovery as well as recursively list files by default. We extract partition columns iff them was defined/needed in the specified table.\r\n2. We can support partition discovery of other file sources(including Text/CSV/JSON/ORC/Parquet) like in Spark. May be users will prefer having this feature by default, which rarely have conflicts with their previous usage.\r\n3. I will dig more about this and try to solve it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/517104868/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/518015880","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/1569#issuecomment-518015880","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/1569","id":518015880,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxODAxNTg4MA==","user":{"login":"yuanlihan","id":44718283,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NzE4Mjgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44718283?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuanlihan","html_url":"https://github.com/yuanlihan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuanlihan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuanlihan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuanlihan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuanlihan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuanlihan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuanlihan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuanlihan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuanlihan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuanlihan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-04T16:09:20Z","updated_at":"2019-08-04T16:09:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Add
