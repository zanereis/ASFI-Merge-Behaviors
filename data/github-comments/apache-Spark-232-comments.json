I think in the example you talked about, the idea is the TaskSetManagers are supposed to be iterated over in the \"fair\" order -- so it's fine if we launch rack-local tasks for task set manager A even if there's a later task set manager that could have launched a node-local task (because the fact that we tried A first means that scheduling the tasks for A is higher priority).\n\nIn terms of what to do for this patch, it seems like we should do @mateiz's suggestion where we add an extra, special locality level that gets called by TaskSchedulerImpl after all of the valid locality levels, that will allow speculative and no-pref tasks to be launched.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49481250/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49481477","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1451#issuecomment-49481477","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1451","id":49481477,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NDgxNDc3","user":{"login":"marmbrus","id":527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus","html_url":"https://github.com/marmbrus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-18T21:25:50Z","updated_at":"2014-07-18T21:25:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks
