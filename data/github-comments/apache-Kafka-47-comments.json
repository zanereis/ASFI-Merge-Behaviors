As promised, I completed my review today and I left one comment and created another PR with more code style improvements:\n\nhttps://github.com/allenxwang/kafka/pull/2\n\nI think we're pretty close (but we'll be sure once Jun takes another look). As far as I can see, outside of the PR I filed, the following is potentially outstanding:\n- [ ] A couple of deprecated constructors in `UpdateMetadataRequest.java` are only used in tests. I'd like to @junrao to confirm that we actually need them.\n- [x] I think we need to tweak the AdminUtils.assignReplicasToBrokers comment a little to integrate it better with what we had there previously.\n- [ ] Jun asked if some tests are actually needed or if they can be simplified. @allenxwang explained why they are needed, so if Jun is happy with the explanation, then this is resolved.\n- [x] Finally, the only non-minor change (although mechanical) is whether we should use a `BrokerMetadata` class instead of broker ids and a separate `rackInfo` map (suggested by Jun). Allen wasn't sure if this was better so it's still being discussed.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/193290563/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/193314115","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1006#issuecomment-193314115","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1006","id":193314115,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MzMxNDExNQ==","user":{"login":"granthenke","id":1928566,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Mjg1NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1928566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke","html_url":"https://github.com/granthenke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-07T15:58:08Z","updated_at":"2016-03-07T15:58:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@ijuma @Parth-Brahmbhatt @SinghAsDev @fpj @ewencp @gwenshap \nCould any of you review this today?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/193314115/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
