recently went through some in-depth looks at the HLL implementation in Druid and @leerho is mostly correct on the Druid HLL shortcomings.

I think the module system is pretty solid in Druid (despite a few hadoop related issues), so I would prefer if HLL were moved to a core module instead of the other way around.\r\n\r\nFor a few items such as cardinality aggregations against dimensions or dimension value tuples it seems like a good idea to me to move it to the DataSketches library instead. If for no other reason than that is is designed to be resolved at query time instead of ingestion time, and thus the \"correctness\" of the value hashing is not at all controllable.

The `Theta` family of sketches are much larger sketches and provide set intersection functionality that the HLL sketches do not.  What I have been proposing is to switch over to the DataSketches-HLL sketch; which has comparable space utilization but with proven accuracy and speed advantages over the Druid-HLL sketch.  I think that this is what you meant to say.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/454880798/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/454881037","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/6814#issuecomment-454881037","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6814","id":454881037,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NDg4MTAzNw==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-16T18:08:24Z","updated_at":"2019-01-16T18:08:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> As such I do not think removing Druid-HLL is a valid path forward.\r\n\r\n100% agree. We do not ever want to break compatibility with existing on-disk segments, so we need to keep it.\r\n\r\n> I think the module system is pretty solid in Druid (despite a few hadoop related issues), so I would prefer if HLL were moved to a core module instead of the other way around.\r\n\r\nDruid core does need some kind of HLL implementation, so they can't all be moved to modules. It's used by DetermineHashedPartitionsJob and IndexTask to determine partitions. We might end up wanting to use it for other things too, like tracking dimension cardinality statistics on the broker to aid in query planning.\r\n\r\nAnother consideration is that HLL-based counting functionality is a pretty standard thing in databases these days. Offering it as a core thing is nearly universal.\r\n\r\nA final consideration is the interaction with Druid SQL. In Druid SQL, by default, `COUNT(DISTINCT x)` uses HLL. You can set `useApproximateCountDistinct = false` but by default it's true. There have been objections raised to this (https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/issues/6814#issuecomment-452056269), but I think it's a good choice for Druid, since it adheres to the Druid philosophy that fast is best, and approximations are how you get there. I feel that doing it in exact mode by default would be un-Druidy. It affects the decision of where to put HLL, since the strategy of count-distinct being approximate by default is only feasible if there's an HLL implementation in core Druid.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/454881037/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/454888977","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/6814#issuecomment-454888977","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6814","id":454888977,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NDg4ODk3Nw==","user":{"login":"drcrallen","id":8213081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMTMwODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8213081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen","html_url":"https://github.com/drcrallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-16T18:31:53Z","updated_at":"2019-01-16T18:32:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"*side note*\r\n\r\nDependency wise the extension looks really clean.

Some values you expect were not in the input. Do you expect some sort of interpolation? Our quantiles sketch does not do anything like that. It does not even assume they are numbers. The only requirement for the algorithm is the \"less than\" relation between the values. To calculate, say, 0.75 quantile exactly one needs to sort the above array and see what value has the normalized rank of 0.75, that is 75% of all values should be less than that value. The value 1700 has 8 values below it, so its rank is 8/11 or about 0.73. So our sketch returns 1700 as the best approximation to 0.75 quantile.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/455356689/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/455361941","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/6638#issuecomment-455361941","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6638","id":455361941,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NTM2MTk0MQ==","user":{"login":"jon-wei","id":8729063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MjkwNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8729063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei","html_url":"https://github.com/jon-wei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-17T22:51:12Z","updated_at":"2019-01-17T22:51:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm going to go ahead and merge this, I think I've addressed the comments and have approval from @clintropolis ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/455361941/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/455366807","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/6370#issuecomment-455366807","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6370","id":455366807,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NTM2NjgwNw==","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-17T23:11:30Z","updated_at":"2019-01-17T23:11:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@leventov sorry for the late review.

If so, do we need to add a way to define the dependency between modules in the future?\r\n\r\nThe only lifecycles I’m aware of outside of tests and the main ‘module’ lifecycle which associated to the server lifetime, are the http-client’s lifecycle [which is it’s own because of history i believe](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/pull/6864#discussion_r248094764), the parameterized-uri-emitter, which I think is a similar situation as the http-client lifecycle, and finally the task master lifecycle, which I think makes sense to be a separate lifecycle as it is tied to lifetime of leadership of overlord rather than overall overlord lifetime. \r\n\r\n>do we need to add a way to define the dependency between modules in the future?\r\n\r\nI don't think it's worth introducing any extra complexity until we absolutely have to, and I'm not sure if we've reached that point yet.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/455370600/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/455371698","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/6397#issuecomment-455371698","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6397","id":455371698,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NTM3MTY5OA==","user":{"login":"clintropolis","id":1577461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzc0NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1577461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis","html_url":"https://github.com/clintropolis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-17T23:34:09Z","updated_at":"2019-01-17T23:34:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@leventov any additional comments before I fix up conflicts?

wanted to update this thread with the current state of progress. I am hoping there will be a PR ready early next week.\r\n\r\nOne of the main goals of this unified console project was to make it as simple as possible technically. It needs to be maintainable by anyone (even people that are not full-time web developers).\r\n\r\n## Work in progress\r\n\r\nHere are some screenshots of the current WIP:\r\n\r\n### Data sources view:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177816/51366524-f76e5680-1a9a-11e9-8386-3ae157933b72.png)\r\nHighly interactive all the views are cross linked\r\n\r\n### Segments view:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177816/51366559-1b319c80-1a9b-11e9-94fc-ebc621a2ebc7.png)\r\nThe quarries here get pushed down to Druid so the browser does not get overwhelmed \r\n\r\n### Tasks view:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177816/51366610-5cc24780-1a9b-11e9-8f21-c9b592b2148b.png)\r\n\r\n### Servers view:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177816/51366637-7a8fac80-1a9b-11e9-90f3-57c84492d5a9.png)\r\n\r\n### SQL view:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177816/51366669-9430f400-1a9b-11e9-9dff-5bc1e803f502.png)\r\nThis is to run arbitrary SQL, also every view provides a link to see its query in the raw so you can go beyond the predefined structure\r\n\r\n### Legacy consoles:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177816/51366711-c2aecf00-1a9b-11e9-895b-d13357087603.png)\r\nAll 3 legacy consoles are also available and embedded within this console allowing you to have a fallback if there is some old functionality that has not made it over yet into the new console. Note that these legacy consoles will be served from the router as well as from their original places meaning that going forward you can go to the router for all your needs.\r\n\r\n## Design\r\n\r\nHere are some key points driving the design of this console:\r\n\r\n- The console is designed to run on the router node and rely on its management proxy to interface to the overlord and coordinator. This makes it much simpler both form the point of the console developer and the user. The router presents a good unifying interface to all of Druid.\r\n\r\n- Heavy reliance on the SQL system tables: this allows great flexibility and iteration in the development of the views and in further iteration. Hopefully one day this console will be 100% powered by system tables.\r\n\r\n- All frontend code is written TypeScript with strict typing turned on. This is both the best way to develop a complex UI and the best way to ensure that future changes do not break the code. Also it should be very familiar to you Java people.\r\n\r\nAll feedback is very welcome. I will keep updating this thread.\r\n \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/455431091/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":3,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/455458992","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/6365#issuecomment-455458992","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6365","id":455458992,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NTQ1ODk5Mg==","user":{"login":"zhaojiandong","id":5977839,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Nzc4Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5977839?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaojiandong","html_url":"https://github.com/zhaojiandong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaojiandong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaojiandong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaojiandong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaojiandong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaojiandong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaojiandong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaojiandong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaojiandong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaojiandong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-18T08:00:16Z","updated_at":"2019-01-18T08:00:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @gianm   @asdf2014 , can you review my pr.

I wait for this PR to make that changes.\r\n\r\nThanks for review!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/455525817/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/455556062","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/6349#issuecomment-455556062","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6349","id":455556062,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NTU1NjA2Mg==","user":{"login":"egor-ryashin","id":14215045,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjE1MDQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14215045?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/egor-ryashin","html_url":"https://github.com/egor-ryashin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egor-ryashin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egor-ryashin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egor-ryashin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egor-ryashin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egor-ryashin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egor-ryashin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egor-ryashin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egor-ryashin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egor-ryashin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-18T14:03:02Z","updated_at":"2019-01-18T14:03:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@glasser \r\n> So I could wait until the historical's segment/count metric goes to zero, or until the SQL query {\"query\":\"SELECT count(*) AS segments FROM sys.server_segments WHERE server = '10.48.27.16:8083'\"} goes to 0?\r\n\r\nExactly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/455556062/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/455561610","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/5859#issuecomment-455561610","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/5859","id":455561610,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NTU2MTYxMA==","user":{"login":"KenjiTakahashi","id":431488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTQ4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/431488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KenjiTakahashi","html_url":"https://github.com/KenjiTakahashi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KenjiTakahashi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KenjiTakahashi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KenjiTakahashi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KenjiTakahashi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KenjiTakahashi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KenjiTakahashi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KenjiTakahashi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KenjiTakahashi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KenjiTakahashi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-18T14:21:08Z","updated_at":"2019-01-18T14:21:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I see I'm kind of late to the party here ;-).

The router requires minimal configuration and there's no other straightforward way of even building a unified console without the router. As someone that created the original coordinator and overlord console, was heavily involved in creating the 2nd gen coordinator console, I can't emphasize enough how much this contribution is needed to make Druid better. Today, you have to go to multiple places to understand where segments are getting built and when they've been finalized. This is a huge pain for initial setup, and debugging segment problems in production is difficult. I've had probably 1000+ conversations about the problems with split consoles and the information that is lacking from them today. This is not to say that reducing Druid processes shouldn't be a goal of the project - as a community I think we should strive to think about how we can merge and simplify processes, but I think today incorporating these changes will make the project better as we continue to work on longer term changes to simplify Druid's architecture.\r\n\r\nThese changes, combined with the repackaging of Druid, will make significant strides to having more adoption, and a much better out of the box experience. Furthermore, debugging issues in production should also become much simpler. Once we reduce Druid's deployment down to 3 server types, each with colocated processes, people will stop focusing on every individual processes and focus much more on server types themselves.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/455609321/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/455610785","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/6832#issuecomment-455610785","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6832","id":455610785,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NTYxMDc4NQ==","user":{"login":"fjy","id":428325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODMyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy","html_url":"https://github.com/fjy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-18T16:43:42Z","updated_at":"2019-01-18T16:43:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@b-slim with regards to the SQL module - once again, I think the tradeoff is well worth it.

If this is set to true, then the brokers are also capable of what routers do.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/455693720/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/455694182","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/6832#issuecomment-455694182","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6832","id":455694182,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NTY5NDE4Mg==","user":{"login":"fjy","id":428325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODMyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy","html_url":"https://github.com/fjy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-18T21:32:22Z","updated_at":"2019-01-18T21:32:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm on board with that","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/455694182/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/455723140","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/6826#issuecomment-455723140","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6826","id":455723140,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NTcyMzE0MA==","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-18T23:45:59Z","updated_at":"2019-01-18T23:45:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@surekhasaharan would you please link the PR you raise to this issue?

But this is not always optimal. Consider a query-level filter like `countryName = 'UK' AND comment LIKE '%foo%'`. Here `countryName` is low cardinality and `comment` is high cardinality (possibly nearly-unique). If \"UK\" is, let's say, 15% of the total row count of `countryName`, then it's probably better to resolve this filter by resolving `countryName = 'UK'` with the index and `comment LIKE '%foo%'` while scanning. The rationale here is that filters resolved via indexes cannot short-circuit, but filters resolved via scanning _can_ short-circuit. So ideally Druid should potentially move some filters to scan-time and even reorder them based on factors like this.\r\n\r\nComing back to the proposal at hand: @peferron you point out that filtered aggregators, today, never use indexes. By the rationale above, this is probably sometimes better and sometimes worse than using indexes. (And it seems like your benchmarks show the same thing.)\r\n\r\nIMO we should be working to make the behavior here consistent: it shouldn't matter whether a filter is query-level or in an aggregator. In either case Druid should resolve them using some logic that tries to take advantage of the factors mentioned above.\r\n\r\nBut, inevitably, it won't always make the best decision. So IMO I also think we should have some way of 'hinting' Druid to use, or not use, the index for a particular filter.\r\n\r\nPutting these two suggestions together: how about we build the hinting system first, which should let users that \"know better\" tell Druid what to do, and then build the automatic decisionmaking system afterwards? (With the goal that most users shouldn't have to provide hints.)\r\n\r\n> Indexes differentiate Druid from its competition—which is usually faster on raw scan speed—so I think it makes sense to try to squeeze as much out of indexes as possible, especially when implementations as good as Roaring are available.\r\n\r\nHopefully the gap narrows, closes, or even inverts with vectorization (#6794) and adaptive compression (#6016).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/456634526/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
