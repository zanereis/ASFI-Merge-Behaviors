provides two types of API libraries:\r\n* The Google APIs Python Client is a client library that are compatibilble with **all Google APIs**.\r\n* The google-cloud-* libraries are built specifically for **the Google Cloud Platform** and provide the recommended way to integrate Google Cloud APIs. This provides much better experience for programmers.\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting that the Discovery library supports all Google services also those less popular among our clients. The google-cloud-* libraries support **only** Google Cloud Platform services. I do not know other libraries that integrate with Google API. Both libraries have identical authorization mechanisms, but they differ in implementation e.g. The Google APIs Python Client  use HTTPS only. In most cases the google-cloud-* libraries use protobuf. In rare cases, they also use HTTPs.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, it is worth introducing a separate hooks for both types of libraries to improve developer experience. Currently, it is necessary to create long descriptions to warn users that a given function can be used only with a given type of library. Despite warnings, even experienced developers face these problems and try to use functions designed for another type of library with the second type of library. \r\nAn example from the last 6 hours (CC: @potiuk)\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5335#discussion_r310900260\r\n\r\nCC: @nuclearpinguin \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/518651385/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/518671989","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5335#issuecomment-518671989","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5335","id":518671989,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxODY3MTk4OQ==","user":{"login":"mik-laj","id":12058428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj","html_url":"https://github.com/mik-laj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-06T13:35:21Z","updated_at":"2019-08-06T13:35:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"As for the operator, I like the idea.

This provides much better experience for programmers.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> It is worth noting that the Discovery library supports all Google services also those less popular among our clients. The google-cloud-* libraries support **only** Google Cloud Platform services. I do not know other libraries that integrate with Google API. Both libraries have identical authorization mechanisms, but they differ in implementation e.g. The Google APIs Python Client use HTTPS only. In most cases the google-cloud-* libraries use protobuf. In rare cases, they also use HTTPs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/519173006/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/519178761","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5724#issuecomment-519178761","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5724","id":519178761,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxOTE3ODc2MQ==","user":{"login":"blcksrx","id":35199552,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MTk5NTUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35199552?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blcksrx","html_url":"https://github.com/blcksrx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blcksrx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blcksrx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blcksrx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blcksrx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blcksrx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blcksrx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blcksrx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blcksrx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blcksrx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-07T16:46:59Z","updated_at":"2019-08-07T16:46:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@potiuk  Hi!

It contains the same changes as the original commit https://github.com/apache/airflow/commit/6ef0e37a63f8c876342f5625ef14c6109efe8eab but applied to v1-10-test branch (some conflicts were resolved). In case you are not aware - the v1-10-test branch is completely separated from master - the current process we have with it that we select commits that we want to merge to 1.10.* and cherry-pick them to that branch. Those two branches are hundreds of commits different (but similar enough that cherry-picks were usually easy so far). What you likely see is the result of diff of your \"master\" with the v1-10-test branch.
