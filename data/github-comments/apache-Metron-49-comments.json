Just running the main in there overwrites the metron-rest README.md.  Which seems very odd, given that `ReadMeUtils` is in the test package.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be no documentation of this class, or its purpose, and I didn't dig enough into the code to figure it out. Even not knowing the details and assuming I'm not misreading what's happening, I don't like that there's an expectation of editing a `README.vm` file, then running a program to produce the final output `README.md`.  `README.md` can vary independently of `README.vm`.  And it already has.\r\n\r\nIt's outside the scope of this ticket, but at minimum, that class needs to be moved out of test, it needs to be actually documented what the purpose of it is, the steps to use it, etc. Right now, though, unless someone comes up with a compelling reason not to, I'm in favor of killing it entirely. I don't ever see that being properly managed, even if it does have some utility built in.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/347857082/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/347869717","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/852#issuecomment-347869717","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/852","id":347869717,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0Nzg2OTcxNw==","user":{"login":"justinleet","id":5077341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzczNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5077341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet","html_url":"https://github.com/justinleet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-29T14:05:11Z","updated_at":"2017-11-29T14:05:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks like @merrimanr commented on the email thread, so I'll copy it here for posterity.\r\n\r\n> I wrote the ReadMeUtils class a long time ago as a way to make documenting\r\nthe REST endpoints easier.

The default main dashboard should come up immediately with Bro and Snort data only. \r\n\r\nI recommend first stopping some services:\r\n\r\n```\r\nservice monit stop\r\nstorm kill profiler\r\n```\r\n\r\nYaf is not enabled by default, but you can start the Yaf topology and turn on all sensor stubs by doing the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# start yaf parser topology\r\nexport METRON_HOST=node1\r\nexport ZOOKEEPER=${METRON_HOST}:2181\r\nexport BROKERLIST=${METRON_HOST}:6667\r\nexport METRON_VERSION=0.4.2\r\nexport METRON_HOME=/usr/metron/${METRON_VERSION}\r\n$METRON_HOME/bin/start_parser_topology.sh -k $BROKERLIST -z $ZOOKEEPER -s yaf\r\n# start the yaf sensor stub\r\nservice sensor-stubs start yaf\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow publish some intentionally bad data to  each of the topics so we can check the error dashboard.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# publish error data on a cycle\r\ncycleval=1; \r\nwhile true; \r\ndo \r\n    if [ $cycleval -ne 0 ]; \r\n    then \r\n        datestamp=$(date \"+%s\");\r\n        cycleval=0;\r\n    else\r\n        cycleval=1;\r\n    fi;\r\n    echo \"bro-garbage-\" $datestamp | /usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list $BROKERLIST --topic bro;\r\n    echo \"snort-garbage-\" $datestamp | /usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list $BROKERLIST --topic snort;\r\n    echo \"yaf-garbage-\" $datestamp | /usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list $BROKERLIST --topic yaf;\r\n    sleep 2;\r\ndone;\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/348085037/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/348091620","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/840#issuecomment-348091620","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/840","id":348091620,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0ODA5MTYyMA==","user":{"login":"mmiklavc","id":658443,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODQ0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/658443?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc","html_url":"https://github.com/mmiklavc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-30T06:06:14Z","updated_at":"2017-11-30T06:06:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"For reference, I've added some PDF snapshots of the dashboards to the Jira\r\n\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12899952/Metron-Dashboard%20-%20Kibana.pdf\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12899951/Metron-Error-Dashboard%20-%20Kibana.pdf","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/348091620/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/348123478","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/852#issuecomment-348123478","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/852","id":348123478,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0ODEyMzQ3OA==","user":{"login":"anandsubbu","id":20395490,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzk1NDkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20395490?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandsubbu","html_url":"https://github.com/anandsubbu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandsubbu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandsubbu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandsubbu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandsubbu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandsubbu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandsubbu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandsubbu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandsubbu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandsubbu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-30T08:57:07Z","updated_at":"2017-11-30T08:57:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 (non-binding) @nickwallen .

inspiration from review.\r\nAlthough the original implementation was functional, it required maintainence to keep current.\r\nThe suggested 'best state' was to have it be possible, maybe through annotations, for the validation\r\nsystem to be able to handle any config, regarless or composition using annotations.\r\nThat would leave it up to the implementor to propertly annotate thier configurations, and allow for support of new fields.\r\n\r\nThis is an implementation of that.\r\n\r\nI have refactored the implemenations and details, but kept the discovery and mechanics ( loading and visitation ) somewhat the same.\r\nHopefully keeping the good and reworking to a more sustainable solution.\r\n\r\nSeveral annotations where created to marks certain stellar configuration objects or scenarios.\r\nA holder object, to hold the configuration object, but knows how to process the annotations and run the visitation was added.\r\nThis holder object and the annotations have parameters and handling for several special scenarios, such as 2x nested maps.\r\n\r\nThis implementation should facilitate follow on work to validate files and streams and blobs by using implementing the StellarValidator interface\r\nand re-using the holder concept ( replacing the providers

In Ambari, go to Metron -> Quick Links -> Swagger UI and go to the \"Meta Alert Controller\".\r\nClick on the create endpoint, and we'll want to send this request (but with the appropriate index subbed in):\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"groups\": [\r\n    \"group_one\",\r\n    \"group_two\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"guidToIndices\": {\r\n    \"snort_test_1\":\"snort_index_2017.09.06.14\",\r\n    \"snort_test_2\":\"snort_index_2017.09.06.14\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nValidate that the metaalert was created and looks good:\r\n```\r\ncurl 'node1:9200/m*/_search?pretty'\r\n{\r\n  \"took\" : 3,\r\n  \"timed_out\" : false,\r\n  \"_shards\" : {\r\n    \"total\" : 1,\r\n    \"successful\" : 1,\r\n    \"failed\" : 0\r\n  },\r\n  \"hits\" : {\r\n    \"total\" : 1,\r\n    \"max_score\" : 1.0,\r\n    \"hits\" : [ {\r\n      \"_index\" : \"metaalerts\",\r\n      \"_type\" : \"metaalert_doc\",\r\n      \"_id\" : \"d414a9f2-7a03-4e47-9108-16b6fc800dd3\",\r\n      \"_score\" : 1.0,\r\n      \"_timestamp\" : 1504725383439,\r\n      \"_source\" : {\r\n        \"average\" : 10.0,\r\n        \"min\" : 10.0,\r\n        \"median\" : 10.0,\r\n        \"alert\" : [ {\r\n          \"msg\" : \"snort test alert\",\r\n          \"threat:triage:rules:0:reason\" : null,\r\n          \"ip_dst_port\" : \"8080\",\r\n          \"ethsrc\" : \"0A:00:27:00:00:00\",\r\n          \"threat:triage:score\" : 10,\r\n          \"is_alert\" : \"true\",\r\n          \"protocol\" : \"TCP\",\r\n          \"source:type\" : \"snort\",\r\n          \"ip_dst_addr\" : \"192.168.66.121\",\r\n          \"ip_src_port\" : \"50187\",\r\n          \"guid\" : \"snort_test_1\",\r\n          \"ip_src_addr\" : \"192.168.66.1\",\r\n          \"threat:triage:rules:0:score\" : 10,\r\n          \"timestamp\" : 1504708744000\r\n        }, {\r\n          \"msg\" : \"snort test alert 2\",\r\n          \"threat:triage:rules:0:reason\" : null,\r\n          \"ip_dst_port\" : \"8080\",\r\n          \"ethsrc\" : \"0A:00:27:00:00:00\",\r\n          \"threat:triage:score\" : 10,\r\n          \"is_alert\" : \"true\",\r\n          \"protocol\" : \"TCP\",\r\n          \"source:type\" : \"snort\",\r\n          \"ip_dst_addr\" : \"192.168.66.121\",\r\n          \"ip_src_port\" : \"50187\",\r\n          \"guid\" : \"snort_test_2\",\r\n          \"ip_src_addr\" : \"192.168.66.1\",\r\n          \"threat:triage:rules:0:score\" : 10,\r\n          \"timestamp\" : 1504708744000\r\n        } ],\r\n        \"max\" : 10.0,\r\n        \"threat:triage:score\" : 20.0,\r\n        \"count\" : 2,\r\n        \"guid\" : \"d414a9f2-7a03-4e47-9108-16b6fc800dd3\",\r\n        \"groups\" : [ \"group_one\", \"group_two\" ],\r\n        \"sum\" : 20.0,\r\n        \"status\" : \"active\"\r\n      }\r\n    } ]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNote that both sub alerts are present, the various counts are filled in, a GUID has been given specifically to this meta alert, etc.\r\n\r\n### Searching\r\nSearching from the REST API works mostly as expected.  After the above data has been created, use the search endpoint to run this query:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"from\": 0,\r\n  \"size\": 2,\r\n  \"indices\": [\r\n    \"*\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"query\": \"guid=snort_test_2\",\r\n  \"sort\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"field\": \"_timestamp\",\r\n      \"sortOrder\": \"ASC\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe result should look similar to the following, and have the messages we'd expect (one from snort and one from metaalerts):\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"total\": 2,\r\n  \"results\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"id\": \"snort_test_2\",\r\n      \"source\": {\r\n        \"msg\": \"snort test alert 2\",\r\n        \"threat:triage:rules:0:reason\": null,\r\n        \"ip_dst_port\": \"8080\",\r\n        \"ethsrc\": \"0A:00:27:00:00:00\",\r\n        \"threat:triage:score\": 10,\r\n        \"is_alert\": \"true\",\r\n        \"protocol\": \"TCP\",\r\n        \"source:type\": \"snort\",\r\n        \"ip_dst_addr\": \"192.168.66.121\",\r\n        \"ip_src_port\": \"50187\",\r\n        \"guid\": \"snort_test_2\",\r\n        \"ip_src_addr\": \"192.168.66.1\",\r\n        \"threat:triage:rules:0:score\": 10,\r\n        \"timestamp\": 1504708744000\r\n      },\r\n      \"score\": 1,\r\n      \"index\": \"snort_index_2017.09.06.14\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"id\": \"d414a9f2-7a03-4e47-9108-16b6fc800dd3\",\r\n      \"source\": {\r\n        \"average\": 10,\r\n        \"min\": 10,\r\n        \"median\": 10,\r\n        \"alert\": [\r\n          {\r\n            \"msg\": \"snort test alert\",\r\n            \"threat:triage:rules:0:reason\": null,\r\n            \"ip_dst_port\": \"8080\",\r\n            \"ethsrc\": \"0A:00:27:00:00:00\",\r\n            \"threat:triage:score\": 10,\r\n            \"is_alert\": \"true\",\r\n            \"protocol\": \"TCP\",\r\n            \"source:type\": \"snort\",\r\n            \"ip_dst_addr\": \"192.168.66.121\",\r\n            \"ip_src_port\": \"50187\",\r\n            \"guid\": \"snort_test_1\",\r\n            \"ip_src_addr\": \"192.168.66.1\",\r\n            \"threat:triage:rules:0:score\": 10,\r\n            \"timestamp\": 1504708744000\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            \"msg\": \"snort test alert 2\",\r\n            \"threat:triage:rules:0:reason\": null,\r\n            \"ip_dst_port\": \"8080\",\r\n            \"ethsrc\": \"0A:00:27:00:00:00\",\r\n            \"threat:triage:score\": 10,\r\n            \"is_alert\": \"true\",\r\n            \"protocol\": \"TCP\",\r\n            \"source:type\": \"snort\",\r\n            \"ip_dst_addr\": \"192.168.66.121\",\r\n            \"ip_src_port\": \"50187\",\r\n            \"guid\": \"snort_test_2\",\r\n            \"ip_src_addr\": \"192.168.66.1\",\r\n            \"threat:triage:rules:0:score\": 10,\r\n            \"timestamp\": 1504708744000\r\n          }\r\n        ],\r\n        \"max\": 10,\r\n        \"threat:triage:score\": 20,\r\n        \"count\": 2,\r\n        \"guid\": \"d414a9f2-7a03-4e47-9108-16b6fc800dd3\",\r\n        \"groups\": [\r\n          \"group_one\",\r\n          \"group_two\"\r\n        ],\r\n        \"sum\": 20,\r\n        \"status\": \"active\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"score\": 1,\r\n      \"index\": \"metaalerts\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/349103038/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/349106422","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/840#issuecomment-349106422","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/840","id":349106422,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0OTEwNjQyMg==","user":{"login":"ottobackwards","id":1111551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTE1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards","html_url":"https://github.com/ottobackwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-04T21:09:55Z","updated_at":"2017-12-04T21:09:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"So, this has me thinking....

I definitely like having test scripts associated with the PR's because we can explicitly see what was done and/or recommended at the time the PR was being ushered into master. But we could also start to consolidate these into manual testing scripts that we reference ongoing. Then you could say something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTesting Plan\r\n- es basic search test\r\n- meta alerts search test\r\n- kibana dashboard smoke test\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat could be links, or we could copy-paste the current manual test plan from the source tree. I think the main thing I would want is to have the PR's test plan (here in the comments) be maintained statically for posterity based on the code at that time. For example, since we're removing the data pruner, the new test plan would not have a data pruner test, but I'd want to make sure any earlier PRs that did have a test plan for it can still be viewed statically. Basically, you'd either include the latest commit as part of the link or copy-paste the test plan.

Great progress and good job so far.  I was able to get several successful runs whereas before it was difficult to get a single successful run.\r\n\r\nA couple of comments/suggestions:\r\n\r\n- I noticed a warning message stating I wasn't on a recent enough version of nodejs.  I think we should be using the maven frontend plugin to run tests so that we guarantee a consistent version is used.  I submitted a [PR](https://github.com/iraghumitra/incubator-metron/pull/6) as an example of how to do this.\r\n\r\n- I noticed there are still several browser.sleep statements throughout the tests (I counted 20).  I think our goal should be to remove all of them.  I know some of these should definitely be removed (alerts-list.po.ts, line 87) and may have just been missed.  If there are cases where we MUST have them, I think those cases needed to be discussed and justified.\r\n\r\n- I feel like the \"should expand all facets\" and \"should collapse all facets\" tests in alert-filters.e2e-spec.ts are unnecessary (and would allow us to remove a couple browser.sleep statements).  These tests are simply opening and closing bootstrap widgets which is controlled by code we don't maintain (bootstrap).

Remove the in memory components and replace any helper methods for setup/teardown\r\n2. Add a namespace to all the test assets (indices and doc types in this case)\r\n\r\nI believe converting other tests will follow this pattern as well.  To answer @ottobackwards's original question about [#854](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/854), adding namespaces will be required when running the tests in parallel against shared infrastructure.
