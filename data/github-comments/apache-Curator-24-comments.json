I assume that \"/root/0\" was recreated and `@root`'s watcher got notified. Note that \"0\" is in the children list. So, this will cause a new node to get created and its wasCreated() called. At 2155, the old `@Node1` gets the result of GET_DATA. This causes a false NODE_ADDED to get generated. `@Node1` is officially dead and should not be reporting this.\n\nI believe the sequence of events is: Just prior to 2136, 1 test code thread changes \"/root/0\" and another deletes it and another recreates it almost immediately. `@Node1`'s watcher is triggered for NodeDataChanged and begins an async call to getData(), it then receives NodeDeleted BEFORE the async getData() occurs on the server. The node then gets recreated. The getData() finally executes on the server and the result is returned such that `@Node1` misses the node deletion.\n\nAnyway, I have a potential fix for now. In processResults() GET_DATA case, add:\n\n```\nif ( nodeState.get() == NodeState.DEAD )\n{\n    break;\n}\n```\n\nThis fixes the problem. Longer term, we should consider moving node management into the main TreeCache instance and not the individual node objects.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/220468433/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604744402","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/curator/issues/844#issuecomment-2604744402","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/844","id":2604744402,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MDQ3NDQ0MDI=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-19T22:20:51Z","updated_at":"2025-01-21T13:30:27Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=githubbot\">githubbot</a>:</i>\n<p>Github user Randgalt commented on the pull request:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/curator/pull/148#issuecomment-220468433\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/curator/pull/148#issuecomment-220468433</a></p>\n\n<p>    I did some further debugging and the problem has something to do with the same node being deleted/updated/recreated in quick succession.

wasDeleted means that wasDeleted() did not publish NODE_REMOVED because the node state was not LIVE</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>    The problem here is the two NODE_ADDED publishes at 2155 and 2282. I believe there is a missing NODE_REMOVED event at 2260.</p>\n\n<p>    Note, at time 2136 we get watcher process() NodeDataChanged immediately followed by a NodeDeleted on @Node1's watcher. <br/>\n    @Node1 then publishes NODE_REMOVED (correctly) at 2136.</p>\n\n<p>    At 2154, @root gets the result of calling getChildren. I assume that \"/root/0\" was recreated and @root's watcher got notified. Note that<br/>\n    \"0\" is in the children list. So, this will cause a new node to get created and its wasCreated() called. At 2155, the old @Node1 gets the<br/>\n    result of GET_DATA. This causes a false NODE_ADDED to get generated. @Node1 is officially dead and should not be reporting this.</p>\n\n<p>    I believe the sequence of events is: Just prior to 2136, 1 test code thread changes \"/root/0\" and another deletes it and another recreates it almost immediately.<br/>\n    @Node1's watcher is triggered for NodeDataChanged and begins an async call to getData(), it then receives NodeDeleted BEFORE the async getData() occurs on the server.<br/>\n    The node then gets recreated. The getData() finally executes on the server and the result is returned such that @Node1 misses the node deletion.</p>\n\n<p>    Anyway, I have a potential fix for now. In processResults() GET_DATA case, add:</p>\n\n<p>    ```<br/>\n    if ( nodeState.get() == NodeState.DEAD )</p>\n    {\nbreak;\n    }\n<p>    ```</p>\n\n<p>    This fixes the problem. Longer term, we should consider moving node management into the main TreeCache instance and not the individual node objects.</p>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604744402/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/220476573","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/curator/pull/148#issuecomment-220476573","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/148","id":220476573,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMDQ3NjU3Mw==","user":{"login":"dragonsinth","id":1919660,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MTk2NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1919660?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dragonsinth","html_url":"https://github.com/dragonsinth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dragonsinth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dragonsinth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dragonsinth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dragonsinth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dragonsinth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dragonsinth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dragonsinth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dragonsinth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dragonsinth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-19T23:08:48Z","updated_at":"2016-05-19T23:08:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks
