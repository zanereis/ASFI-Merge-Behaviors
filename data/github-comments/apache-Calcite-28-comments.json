thanks for your awesome work! I merged your change into this PR. I tried to squash this PR to two commits: one is my change and then one is yours so we can keep your credit in the git log. Unfortunately I messed that up and all the changes are merged into one single commit now.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you want to have two commits to separate changes. I can try to rebuild and see if I can recover it.\r\n\r\nI was able to address one of the TODO. I didn't figure out this TODO:\r\n```\r\n    if (isTumble) {\r\n      // TODO: should move this code to RexImpTable and keep the code\r\n      // in this class unchanged.\r\n      return tableValuedFunctionWindowingImplement(implementor, pref);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI was guessing you want to use [1] to encapsulate some of the code into `RexImpTable`. As far as I can tell, `CallImplementor`'s interface is a little simple to encapsulate all the enumerable code of tumbling. I checked what is the existing practice. For example, I checked `EnumerableMergeJoin`, and `EnumerableMergeJoin` has the same practice as what is doing in `EnumerableTableFunctionScan`.\r\n\r\n[1]:

Current implementation is less extensible as there will be more built-in table-valued function implementations and we cannot have many if-else with their own enumerable implementations.  An implementor interface would be desired for each implementation. \r\n\r\nHowever, I believe current `CallImplementor` or `NotNullImplementor` is not enough for table-valued functions like `tumbling`. Table-valued functions cannot be done by the following code.\r\n```\r\n// RexCalls that are suitable for `CallImplementor` or `NotNullImplementor`\r\nfor (operand : call.operands())  {\r\n   translate(operand);\r\n}\r\n\r\ntranslate(call, translatedOperands);\r\n```  \r\n\r\n\r\nBecause at least it requires `inputPhysType`, and very likely require `outputPhysType`and others params. Likely, table-valued function need following this:\r\n```\r\ntranslate(table_valued_fucntion_call.operands(), inputPhysType, ...)) // with the help of `inputPhysType`.\r\n```\r\nI can give a simple example: assume there is a table-valued function(TVF) that takes an table as input and a descriptor of a single column name. This TVF always return a table with all distinct values from one of columns that is specified by the descriptor in input table. In this example,  `inputPhysType` will be needed to know the type of that column and the find the right `distinct` implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think we need a new interface for this purpose, I have filed [CALCITE-3629](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-3629). \r\n\r\nIn the latest commit, I tried to address the concern by moving some Tumbling code to `EnumUtils`, per the existing practice of enumerables and not every line of code can be moved out. Meanwhile, I would suggest to solve [CALCITE-3629](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-3629) when I add `HOP` implementation (a work after this PR). The rationale are\r\n- we need more implementations to build an abstraction and then which leads to a good interface design.\r\n- add an interface should be in a separate commit.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/568799995/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/568823430","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/1680#issuecomment-568823430","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/1680","id":568823430,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2ODgyMzQzMA==","user":{"login":"helloppx","id":1185105,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODUxMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1185105?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/helloppx","html_url":"https://github.com/helloppx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/helloppx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/helloppx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/helloppx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/helloppx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/helloppx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/helloppx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/helloppx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/helloppx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/helloppx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-25T02:22:56Z","updated_at":"2019-12-25T02:22:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"By
