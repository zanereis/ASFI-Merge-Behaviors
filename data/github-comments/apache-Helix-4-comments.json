You could leave getWorkflows() as is,  and make getWorkflows(long timeout) a wrapper that calls getWorkflows() in a ExecutorService thread. This would be the only change needed for this PR; namely, adding a wrapper method with a timeout. If you want to implement a different parse logic or isWorkflowConfig method, let's create a separate issue/PR for those and discuss whether we really need them. We want to keep changes small, modular, and incremental.\n\n2. Optional is a wrapper for its underlying objects, so it uses more memory and adds the work of boxing/unboxing. I am not claiming that this is significant, but it is a cost we do not have to incur.\n\n3. This method could be called as frequently as users want. We do not cache at the HelixManager level and haven't had the use case for this. If there is a need, we could further discuss, but it should not be part of this PR (out of scope).\n\n-hunter\n\nOn Jul 24, 2019, 00:20, at 00:20, pkuwm <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n>pkuwm commented on this pull request.\n>\n>\n>\n>> +   * Batch get the configurations of all workflows in this cluster\n>+   * within the specified timeout in milliseconds.\n>+   *\n>+   * @param timeout a long integer presents the timeout, in\n>milliseconds\n>+   * @return a map of <String, WorkflowConfig>\n>+   * @throws InterruptedException if the future thread was interrupted\n>+   * @throws ExecutionException if the future task completed\n>exceptionally\n>+   * @throws TimeoutException if waiting for result timed out\n>+   */\n>+  public Map<String, WorkflowConfig> getWorkflows(long timeout)\n>+    throws CancellationException, InterruptedException,\n>ExecutionException, TimeoutException {\n>+    if (timeout <= 0L) {\n>+      throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"timeout must be positive.\");\n>+    }\n>+    \n>+    ExecutorService executorService =\n>Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();\n>\n>Do you have an idea of how frequently the api is called?

To avoid creating the thread pool each time at once when new a TaskDriver, instead I create a `startPool()` to create the thread pool: if getWorkflows(long timeout) is not going to call, it is not necessary to create the thread pool.\r\n\r\nFor the pool size, we will let caller to choose a good pool size for the needs.\r\n\r\nAnd why I don't use `ScheduledExecutorService` is because `ScheduledExecutorService` could also be used to delay to start a task, which we don't need. Thanks for the suggestion.\r\n\r\n> I'm afraid the underlying the executor is creating a thread pool with one worker. If this is the case, there's certainly overhead if each time when the method gets invoked, the thread gets created and deleted after the method call. I don't think creating a thread every time is cheap, I would suggest making it a private field.

To manipulate the situation in an integration test would be much harder. My general suggestion is still the same, something like\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> // create a resource data provider\r\n> class CustomHashMap {\r\n>    Lock lock; \r\n> \r\n>  // manually create race conditions in the implementation \r\n> }\r\n> \r\n> Map<>  propertyChangeMap = new CustomHashMap();\r\n> Lock lock = propertyChangeMap.getLock()\r\n> ResourceDataProvider provider = new ResourceDataProvider(propertyChangeMap)\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nIf we are going to add this test, it will be a very white box test. Basically, what we can test is how many times the map.get() is called in one typical cache refresh. So easier way is to count the map.get() calls. That actually serves the same target.\r\nWith this change, as long as the caller is using getAndSet, we will be good.\r\nTo summary, two reasons that I think the test is not necessary. 1. even you create the custom HashMap, the implementation can still get that value and call the get() multiple times, and the map won't know. 2. the cache code will be refactored soon, so these logics will be gone in most cases.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/516194738/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/516210666","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/helix/pull/362#issuecomment-516210666","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/362","id":516210666,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNjIxMDY2Ng==","user":{"login":"jiajunwang","id":1803880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDM4ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1803880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang","html_url":"https://github.com/jiajunwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-30T00:23:51Z","updated_at":"2019-07-30T00:23:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the comments, I have addressed most of them today.

For the general comments, I'm trying to answer here.\r\n\r\n> You could just have a blank method without detail implementations since the implementation details are very likely to change as we proceed. It's the same principle of interface oriented programming as well.\r\n\r\nI agree with the idea, but since we have the POC code already, I will just take this low-hanging fruit. With the latest update, all the essential parts are ready.\r\n\r\n> More and detailed comments are more than welcome, at least we need to document better than our current algorithm does.\r\n\r\nAgreed. Especially the algorithm and rebalancer main logic. When we working on those parts later, let's firstly try to keep it simple. Then adding comments whenever necessary.\r\n\r\n> If you agree with item1, let's not worry about the unit test. Things will change.\r\n\r\nUnit test is actually very important. Even with the interface only, I would prefer to have the test frame completed. Of course, they have been already completed anyway.\r\n\r\n> A lot of more basic data model is not well defined (I know we didn't originally have the habit)(. E.g, String class is used everywhere, sometimes it is partition name, sometimes it is a resource name, sometimes it is a state. It's very confusing and inconsistent, my experience tells me putting comments won't make our life easier, a more self-explanatory code is needed.\r\n\r\nI agree with this point in general. But I have two concerns.\r\n1. If all Helix components create their own data model objects, it is a large overhead, from both coding's perspective and performance perspective.\r\n2. If we have multiple data model objects pointing to the same item, it might be very confusing and error-prone. The reason is that most model objects we have now have additional fields other than the name. For example, Resource contains config. If we have multiple Resource objects refer to the same resource, we could modify the wrong one. If it's a String, although we might have duplication, we cannot do anything to it.\r\n\r\nIn general, I think we can do either of the following to improve it.\r\n1. Convert (or create) data model classes to the key classes for different types of objects.\r\n2. Only constructing these data model objects in one place. For example, cluster cache. In this way, there is only one object for each entity. We won't have any confusion.\r\n\r\nI think it's a good call. Although I don't intend to do it in this PR, since it seems to be a larger decision to make, I will follow up with we have a more concrete plan. I will encourage you to think about this point at the whole project scope and maybe initial a discussion with all of us to proceed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/517151234/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/517424827","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/helix/pull/369#issuecomment-517424827","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/369","id":517424827,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNzQyNDgyNw==","user":{"login":"narendly","id":10107095,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTA3MDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10107095?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly","html_url":"https://github.com/narendly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-01T19:27:18Z","updated_at":"2019-08-01T19:27:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Please

It's the upper class' job to make the right parallel requests and I'm planning to address it later in the next PR piece by piece. Is your idea to dedupe the # of threads based on requests, in that case, the dedupe logic needs to be handled in the upper layer.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/518406925/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/518442369","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/helix/pull/374#issuecomment-518442369","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/374","id":518442369,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxODQ0MjM2OQ==","user":{"login":"junkaixue","id":6695617,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTU2MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6695617?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junkaixue","html_url":"https://github.com/junkaixue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junkaixue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junkaixue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junkaixue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junkaixue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junkaixue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junkaixue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junkaixue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junkaixue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junkaixue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-05T23:51:20Z","updated_at":"2019-08-05T23:51:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> A lot of duplicate prints, can you check testng's BeforeMethod and AfterMethod annotations\r\n> https://dzone.com/articles/testng-aftermethod-annotation\r\n\r\nThat's a good point.
