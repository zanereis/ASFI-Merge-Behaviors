Ref:\r\n\r\n```\r\nExpected: an instance of org.apache.spark.SparkException\r\n     but: <java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Failed to cleanly delete data files matching: ref(name=\"id\") == 1> is a java.lang.IllegalArgumentException\r\n\tat org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat(MatcherAssert.java:20)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's from here (the non-distributed version):\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/master/spark/v3.2/spark/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/spark/source/SparkTable.java#L271\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough most of the time it will hit the distributed delta delete, there is a chance here it will fall to this non-distributed metadata version.  This is if the optimizer (OptimizeMetadataOnlyDeleteFromTable in particular) believes that the delete can be handled with just metadata.  The appendFuture tries to avert this by constructing a file of two elements (1,2) and each time the deleteFuture hits only (1), but if it has not run yet then the table is empty the deleteFuture decides it proceed with metadata-only delete.  Most of those times that delete goes through fine as there is nothing to do and the test gets another try to get the right exception, but a very smaller percentage of time it may find the appendFuture has landed right before the commit and then fails in the above code path.\r\n\r\nOne fix is to try to add expected checks this potential failure.  Another fix is to make sure that there is some pre-existing data to force it always to use the distributed delta delete, Ill try to make a pr for that.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1039508890/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1039602241","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4047#issuecomment-1039602241","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4047","id":1039602241,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX8499xJB","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-14T21:48:29Z","updated_at":"2022-02-14T21:48:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rdblue, you are right.

I am thinking we have some kind of notion of a TransactionContext which we can embed in the API implementation which would allow us to hide transaction details for an API. I still have not thought through what's a good way to abstract the passing/setting of a transaction context, but basically I'm thinking of having a context which can be used internally in API implementations. When the API is called we implicitly add to a transaction created behind the scenes. Then when we commit the SnapshotProducer operation we commit the transaction maintained in the context. Still pretty vague I know :) ,\r\n\r\nBefore all that, for cherry-pick I think we should enumerate the cases where we say \"This is a conflict we cannot handle\". I think for simplicity we handle the AppendFile/DeleteFile cases. it becomes trickier when say we do an Update colA for record1 on main branch, and then we do a update colA to a different value for record1 on dev-branch. Then when we cherry-pick dev-branch onto main, we should fail. This is more of a merge semantic, which we're trying to avoid, but if since we're not directly following git semantics it'll be good to explicitly outline our desired behavior.\r\n\r\nWe may want to enumerate those cases in a separate issue so the community is aligned on what the desired behavior for cherry-pick.\r\n\r\n@rdblue @jackye1995 let me know your thoughts","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1039743636/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1039753697","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4088#issuecomment-1039753697","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4088","id":1039753697,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX849-WHh","user":{"login":"wypoon","id":3925490,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjU0OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3925490?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon","html_url":"https://github.com/wypoon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-15T01:28:25Z","updated_at":"2022-02-15T01:28:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rdblue we're testing Iceberg 0.13.0.

Hive on the other hand, does not seem to materialize the default value upon schema evolution.  Oracle 10g behaves like PostgreSql, but a performance enhancement (referred to as fast column update) in Oracle 11g, the default value lives in the schema definition and not materialized. So, this seems to me an implementation details. I checked [SQL 1992 (11.5  default clause > 2)](https://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~shadow/sql/sql1992.txt), and it states that default value is driven from the `<column descriptor>` , if not, then from the `range`'s default value, o.w., it is

The Hudi metadata server makes sense generally. However, Iceberg doesn’t have the some of issues in Hudi, for example, file listing issue in Hudi metadata.\r\n\r\nI list some benefits of an Iceberg metadata server.\r\n1. Multiple-table transaction\r\n2. Performance improvement\r\n        1. Avoid send the full metadata json file from client to server\r\n        2. Queuing multiple commits, other than each client resolves write-write conflict by themselves.\r\n        3. Caching resources like JDBC connections\r\n3. Safer commits\r\n        1. Clients with different versions can safely commit, without worrying about overwriting the newer properties\r\n        2. Server side holds the truth of table format, upgrade to a newer version doesn’t need changes of all clients as long as API compatibility is kept.\r\n\r\nThere could be more benefits though.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n* Related PRs: https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3770\r\n* Table metadata Rest API design Doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D0R3G0slssEhggH5XnIzMwsUIP-c385Qp2sjv5E7e6E/edit#heading=h.eo4x0coo8esy\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1042349608/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1042378558","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4140#issuecomment-1042378558","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4140","id":1042378558,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX84-IW8-","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-16T22:38:36Z","updated_at":"2022-02-16T22:38:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"We rarely change this class, so I'm not sure it's worth all the reformatting and extra builder, but I'm okay with this if @RussellSpitzer is in favor.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1042378558/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1042382801","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4133#issuecomment-1042382801","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4133","id":1042382801,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX84-IX_R","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-16T22:45:51Z","updated_at":"2022-02-16T22:45:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@aokolnychyi can you take a look?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1042382801/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
