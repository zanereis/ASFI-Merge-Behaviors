Tried that already 5 times this morning. Getting always the same results. It fails always by starting the controllers. Every time I log in to the VM I can see that there are two Docker containers for the controller in exit status. Here is the output from `docker ps -a` inside of the Vagrant box: \r\n\r\n```\r\nCONTAINER ID        IMAGE                         COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                              PORTS                                                              NAMES\r\n108a1d038452        openwhisk/controller:latest   \"/bin/sh -c 'export C\"   9 minutes ago       Restarting (1) About a minute ago   0.0.0.0:8001->2551/tcp, 0.0.0.0:10002->8080/tcp                    controller1\r\n23527dee7b99        openwhisk/controller:latest   \"/bin/sh -c 'export C\"   9 minutes ago       Restarting (1) About a minute ago   0.0.0.0:8000->2551/tcp, 0.0.0.0:10001->8080/tcp                    controller0\r\n9483d14b5edf        ches/kafka:0.10.2.1           \"/start.sh\"              10 minutes ago      Up 10 minutes                       7203/tcp, 0.0.0.0:9092->9092/tcp                                   kafka\r\nad63d6e0c58a        zookeeper:3.4                 \"/docker-entrypoint.s\"   12 minutes ago      Up 12 minutes                       2888/tcp, 0.0.0.0:2181->2181/tcp, 3888/tcp                         zookeeper\r\nf2972d0ec0c9        openwhisk/apigateway:0.8.2    \"/usr/local/bin/dumb-\"   13 minutes ago      Up 13 minutes                       80/tcp, 8423/tcp, 0.0.0.0:9000->9000/tcp, 0.0.0.0:9001->8080/tcp   apigateway\r\n2e7b11e8dd0d        redis:3.2                     \"docker-entrypoint.sh\"   13 minutes ago      Up 13 minutes                       0.0.0.0:6379->6379/tcp                                             redis\r\ne678f31af41c        klaemo/couchdb:2.0            \"tini -- /docker-entr\"   17 minutes ago      Up 17 minutes                       4369/tcp, 9100/tcp, 0.0.0.0:5984->5984/tcp                         couchdb\r\n```\r\n\r\n`controller0` and `controller1` are always restarting.

cluster on a single machine.\r\n\r\nAs of now I am trying the following scenario.\r\n\r\n1. use same epmd port(`4369`) for all couchdb nodes.\r\n2. do not map that port to host (remove `-p 4369:4369`).\r\n3. trying to form a cluster.\r\n\r\nSince both nodes will be running on a single machine, they will be in the same subnet.\r\nThey might be able to communicate with each other using their container IPs.\r\n\r\nSo though port is not opened in host layer, they may be able to connect to other node using `172.17.0.2:4369`.\r\nFor this, when we deploy couchdb, we need to specify its

You can find the details on [Kafka Docs](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/)\r\nBy the way, it could lead to lose some messages if leader of kafka fails before copying data to the followers.\r\n\r\nIf we want to get more guarantee that there's no message lose after receiving ack, we can set 'ACKS_CONFIG' to \"all\" which means leader of kafka responds message after finishing replication.\r\nI changed 'ACKS_CONFIG\" to \"all\" and roughly checked latency of producing message by getting duration between the \"posting topic ... \" log and \"posted to ...\" log. I ignored that first 20 logs because there's some latency of kafka warm-up. Here's the result.\r\n\r\n- RF: 1 (ack = 1)\r\n> min: less than 1ms\r\n   avg: 0.4 ms\r\n   max: 4.0 ms\r\n\r\n- RF: 1 (ack = all)\r\n> min: less than 1ms\r\n   avg: 3.6 ms\r\n   max: 25.0 ms\r\n\r\n- RF: 2 (ack = all)\r\n> min: less than 1ms\r\n   avg: 10.4 ms\r\n   max: 52.0 ms\r\n\r\n- RF: 3 (ack = all)\r\n> min: less than 1ms\r\n   avg: 14.4ms\r\n   max: 87.0ms\r\n\r\nwe can find that \"ack=all\" increase latency even in case of RF=1. Maybe we need to provide config to set ACKS_CONFIG

many thanks for the update on the review comments and the investigation on latency. I think what you described makes perfect sense and making the ACKS_CONFIG value configurable per environment is the right thing to do.\r\n\r\nI've done some tests on latency and load of the overall system as well and was not possible to detect a regression. I've tested maximum throughput with a single user/action and with 100 different users. Further checked on latency for different runtimes. All numbers in the same ballpark.\r\n\r\nFurther I've performed some investigations on resiliency under load and found that even with `acks=1` the loss during the outage of a single node seems acceptable. \r\n\r\nSince OW is latency sensitive I would vote to go with `acks=1` as default and allow a \"deployer\" to override the default per deployment. We might need a comment on the setting to describe the tradeoff.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/344285888/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/344309734","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/2948#issuecomment-344309734","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/2948","id":344309734,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NDMwOTczNA==","user":{"login":"dgrove-oss","id":5099100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTkxMDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5099100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss","html_url":"https://github.com/dgrove-oss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-14T16:13:22Z","updated_at":"2017-11-14T20:03:25Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"squashed to single commit.  \r\nPG2 2313 🔵 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/344309734/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/344328682","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/2928#issuecomment-344328682","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/2928","id":344328682,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NDMyODY4Mg==","user":{"login":"spattewar","id":30623340,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjIzMzQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30623340?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spattewar","html_url":"https://github.com/spattewar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spattewar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spattewar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spattewar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spattewar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spattewar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spattewar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spattewar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spattewar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spattewar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-14T17:09:40Z","updated_at":"2017-11-14T17:09:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@markusthoemmes \r\nThank you for your comments.\r\nWe want to process around 1 million events and were looking for openwhisk.
