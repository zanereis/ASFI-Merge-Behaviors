Generated client code sends a oneway request.\r\n2. HTTP transport packages it up and send it to the server.  This could be through a proxy.\r\n3. Server receives it.  Since it is a oneway request, my assumption is the server, no matter what the language, has a HTTP transport that issues a response (like 200 OK without content, or 204 as you stated).  If it did not, it wouldn't work through a proxy (or at least, the proxy might behave badly).\r\nAn example of this can be found at https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/master/lib/py/src/server/THttpServer.py#L86.\r\n4. Client has no generated response reader code because it is oneway, so the client code never attempts to get the transport response (which is fair, oneway probably came around before we had a transport with a mandatory response).  However now there's a transport reply sitting in the buffer.\r\n5. The next request sent by the client that is normal (not oneway) would send the request and then read the HTTP 1.1 200 OK response buffered from from the oneway request, and the actual reply to the two-way request would get queued up; however the response processor for the twoway request, seeing no payload, would throw an exception.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/437681718/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/437681878","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/1625#issuecomment-437681878","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/1625","id":437681878,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNzY4MTg3OA==","user":{"login":"jeking3","id":11771245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzcxMjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11771245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3","html_url":"https://github.com/jeking3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-11T15:58:27Z","updated_at":"2018-11-11T15:58:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I assume the default setting is to use the previous way, and this is a new way, so it is backwards compatible?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/437681878/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/437682746","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/1618#issuecomment-437682746","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/1618","id":437682746,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNzY4Mjc0Ng==","user":{"login":"allengeorge","id":69364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/allengeorge","html_url":"https://github.com/allengeorge","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allengeorge/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allengeorge/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allengeorge/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allengeorge/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allengeorge/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allengeorge/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allengeorge/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allengeorge/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allengeorge/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-11T16:10:19Z","updated_at":"2018-11-11T16:10:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Oh.

update to Java 1.8.\r\n\r\nIn regards to Ant, I would like to request that we table that for a different JIRA in order to more thoroughly examine if it is still a dependent.  I see it's still being installed as a dependency in the Docker container, so it may still be needed.
