Our current status is, if framework launches multiple task groups (pods) via a single default executor, all the nested containers of all these task groups will share the executor's network namespace. This is actually different from Kubernetes pod where each pod will have its own network namespace and all the container in a pod will share the same network namespace so that they can communicated with 127.0.0.1/localhost. IMHO, we should consider to do something similar with Kubernetes, i.e., each task group will have its own network namespace rather than each nested container has its own network namespace unless we have a use case for it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mesos/issues/comments/367589377/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mesos/issues/comments/367703731","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mesos/pull/265#issuecomment-367703731","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mesos/issues/265","id":367703731,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NzcwMzczMQ==","user":{"login":"packtpartner","id":15008907,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDA4OTA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15008907?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/packtpartner","html_url":"https://github.com/packtpartner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/packtpartner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/packtpartner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/packtpartner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/packtpartner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/packtpartner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/packtpartner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/packtpartner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/packtpartner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/packtpartner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-22T14:48:37Z","updated_at":"2018-02-22T14:48:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"No we do not have a non-gated version of this.
