\n\n``` java\nVortexFuture enqueueMockedTasklet(final Tasklet tasklet)\n```\n\nWithout this method currently there's no way for us to check the state of `Tasklet`. In current unit tests that test `DefaultVortexMaster`, we pass mocked `Tasklet`s whose ids we know to here and use their ids to track their state.(e.g. whether they were scheduled to a worker).\n\nIf we are to remove this method, I think we need to have each `VortexFuture` hold onto its corresponding `Tasklet`'s id. In this way we can use the following same method that the Vortex user api uses and still obtain the `Tasklet`'s id. But I do not prefer this approach because it exposes `Tasklet` ids to Vortex users.\n\n``` java\nVortexFuture<TOutput> enqueueTasklet(final VortexFunction<TInput, TOutput> function, final TInput input)\n```\n\nAnother approach is to change the structure of `DefaultVortexMasterTest` unit test.\n\nMaybe I'm missing something?
