To understand it correctly let me quickly run with an example\r\nThe data that is generated for a dataset will be in some range of 1MB for each 500 datasets. I had set the following properties\r\n\"hoodie.parquet.small.file.limit\": 2*1024*1024,\r\n \"hoodie.parquet.max.file.size\": 2*1024*1024*1024,\r\nSo to understand correctly  when the data write happens the size 1 MB less than the 2 MB small file limit the first parquet written will be 1 MB. The second write of the data which is another 1 MB should merge to existing parquet. For the 3 write the data will be 1 MB but the first partition is already reached the 2 MB so second parquet will be created? \r\nWhere does maxsize will be used in this process?\r\n\r\nAlso this will happen automatically or I need to specify some other properties to take this into effect apart from the two properties I have specified. \r\n\r\nAlso if want to contribute to the development of the clustering feature what will be the process for it?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/658837587/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/658842626","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/1722#issuecomment-658842626","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1722","id":658842626,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1ODg0MjYyNg==","user":{"login":"garyli1019","id":23007841,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDA3ODQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23007841?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/garyli1019","html_url":"https://github.com/garyli1019","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garyli1019/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garyli1019/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garyli1019/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garyli1019/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garyli1019/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garyli1019/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garyli1019/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garyli1019/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garyli1019/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-15T15:42:38Z","updated_at":"2020-07-15T15:42:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@vinothchandar I agree we should use @umehrot2 RDD approach. \r\n>So you can also in parallel just proceed?\r\n\r\nYes, I will change this PR in parallel. \r\n>Do you just want the two util classes landed?

In fact I do think current solution is more reasonable and cleaner IMHO, other callers would call the method without checking the empty and let the method to check empty. If you check empty before calling the method, there will be a lot of duplicate code.

yes, if you want all older copies to be deleted, guess you have to set the configs you have listed. For incremental pulling, point in time queries, etc older commits will still have the records. only the commit in which delete was issued will have the record deleted.

But if you query with a older commit time, you could see the deleted record as per that time instant, since these records are not deleted as of that time instant.\r\n\r\nThanks, it was helpful.

When you set this property to ```false`` only then will Spark use `Parquet InputFormat` as well as its listing code. Otherwise by default Spark uses its native listing (parallelized over the cluster) and parquet readers which are supposed to be faster.\r\n\r\nHowever the way Hudi works is it uses `InputFormat` implementation. Thus for a fair comparison when you test regular parquet with Spark you should set ```spark.sql.hive.convertMetastoreParquet=false``` and I think you will observe quite similar behavior then as to what you are seeing. Would you mind trying that out once ?\r\n\r\nBut @bvaradar irrespective I think for Hudi we should always compare our performance against standard spark performance (native listing and reading) and not the performance of spark when it is made to go through InputFormat.
