In comparison with my initial models, there are two increases in accuracy:\r\n1. Random data modifications you have in `train_transform` give a significant boost over not having them in the `transform` function\r\n2. Even with them, there is a difference with using `get_data_rec` instead.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, in my use case I need a fixed training dataset rather than a dataset which changes at every epoch.\r\nFeel free to close this issue; however, I still don't understand though why there is a difference in accuracy in 2.

After reading what you discussed above, I tested your mxnet fork(branch: batched_op_perf_regression) with a script from [here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/9396). Though the number of cudaStreamSynchronize calls returned to a small one which is exactly the same as the old mxnet version(i.e. 0.10.0), I also noticed the avg time cost of this function increased a little bit. In my case, the network runs faster than the original mxnet 1.0.0 but a bit slower than mxnet 0.10.0. At the same time, the gpu usage increased from 83% to 95%, but is still not fully utilized.
