when you use mysql tinyint（1）,the result is boolean value,you shoule tinyint(2) tinyint(3) or tiny(4) i think it not a bug ，either.\r\n\r\nHi @Myshiner , I understand what you said, I debug the Sharding-Proxy's code.\r\nin `org.apache.shardingsphere.shardingproxy.transport.mysql.packet.command.query.text.MySQLTextResultSetRowPacket` class file:\r\n```\r\n@Override\r\npublic void write(final MySQLPacketPayload payload) {\r\n    for (Object each : data) {\r\n        if (null == each) {\r\n            payload.writeInt1(NULL);\r\n        } else {\r\n            if (each instanceof byte[]) {\r\n                payload.writeBytesLenenc((byte[]) each);\r\n            } else if (each instanceof Timestamp) {\r\n                payload.writeStringLenenc(each.toString().split(\"\\\\.\")[0]);\r\n            } else if (each instanceof BigDecimal) {\r\n                payload.writeStringLenenc(((BigDecimal) each).toPlainString());\r\n            } else if (each instanceof Boolean) {\r\n                payload.writeBytesLenenc((Boolean) each ? new byte[]{1} : new byte[]{0});\r\n            } else {\r\n

client.\r\nthe process is:\r\n- MySQL JDBC Driver convert tinyint(1) to Boolean type and return to Sharding-Proxy;\r\n- Sharding-Proxy convert a Boolean value to Netty's ByteBuf one byte and return to client.\r\n\r\nI think this is not a problem. We can discuss this issue with ShardingSphere team, How to handle it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/544248475/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/544331442","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/650#issuecomment-544331442","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/650","id":544331442,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NDMzMTQ0Mg==","user":{"login":"haetao","id":46469719,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDY5NzE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46469719?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haetao","html_url":"https://github.com/haetao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haetao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haetao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haetao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haetao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haetao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haetao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haetao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haetao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haetao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-21T03:08:00Z","updated_at":"2019-10-21T03:08:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"[https://blog.csdn.net/qq_30087985/article/details/102659478](https://blog.csdn.net/qq_30087985/article/details/102659478)
