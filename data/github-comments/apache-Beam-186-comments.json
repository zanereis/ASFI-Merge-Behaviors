`SplittableDoFnTest.testOutputAfterCheckpoint()` fails on the Flink Runner. If you instrument the test (with a little sysout printing in a ParDo) you see that the SDF only emits elements up to 12344. If, in `BoundedSourceWrapper` (which executes the `Create.of(\"foo\")` on Flink), you replace the end of the `run()` method by\r\n```\r\n    // emit final Long.MAX_VALUE watermark, just to be sure\r\n    // ctx.emitWatermark(new Watermark(Long.MAX_VALUE));\r\n\r\n    while (isRunning) {\r\n      Thread.sleep(500);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nyou see all values correctly emitted but the test never stops because the source is now unbounded. (Interestingly, if you replace that one line by `ctx.emitWatermark(new Watermark(BoundedWindow.TIMESTAMP_MAX_VALUE.getMillis()));` you get values up to 34567)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problem seems to be that the code running the SDF sees the high watermarks and then doesn't emit stuff anymore. Do you have an idea what could be going on there? If not we'll probably have to delve deeper into the code.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/297954995/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/297956141","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/2759#issuecomment-297956141","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/2759","id":297956141,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5Nzk1NjE0MQ==","user":{"login":"wypb","id":5170878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzA4Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5170878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypb","html_url":"https://github.com/wypb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-28T09:45:06Z","updated_at":"2017-04-28T09:45:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"R:
