, @RussellSpitzer : As there was no response, I assumed people are more inclined toward modifying the default warehouse location.  I have modified it as the same. Please help in merging this issue fix.

It also uses a diff-based approach that can avoid a lot more conflicts. I'm not sure how easy it would be for Nessie to update to be compatible with that client API, though. And I imagine it isn't a high priority just to avoid commit conflicts and enable metadata caching.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1193413999/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1193622353","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/5281#issuecomment-1193622353","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/5281","id":1193622353,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85HJTtR","user":{"login":"hililiwei","id":59213263,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MjEzMjYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59213263?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei","html_url":"https://github.com/hililiwei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-25T06:10:34Z","updated_at":"2022-07-25T06:10:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for review, addressed the round of comments. @amogh-jahagirdar \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1193622353/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1193718724","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/5159#issuecomment-1193718724","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/5159","id":1193718724,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85HJrPE","user":{"login":"pvary","id":19705742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzA1NzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19705742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary","html_url":"https://github.com/pvary","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-25T08:03:18Z","updated_at":"2022-07-25T08:03:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@gaborkaszab I think the main question is if we set the table property for owning the full directory then do we expect that all of the files are in the given directory, and there is no files outside of this directory.

At first, it seems like a reasonable thing to support. But, Iceberg table properties are not intended to be used for arbitrary user metadata like this. They are intended for information to configure reading or writing a table. The existing behavior is that set is idempotent, so it is a stretch to say that Iceberg should support a new feature so you can use table properties for a different purpose.\r\n\r\nThere is also an implementation problem with this. Not all catalogs can guarantee the behavior introduced in this PR. For example, the REST protocol's `SetPropertiesUpdate` is an idempotent change. There's no way to communicate what the catalog service should do if there is a conflict, or even to signal that it should fail and retry in the event of a conflict. At a minimum, we would need to add a validation for table properties that enabled failing the server-side commit.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure that those changes are worth it. Have you considered using a prefix instead of a single option? Instead of `subscribers=a,b,c` you could set `subscribers.a.enabled=true`, `subscribers.b.enabled=true`, etc. That gives you the ability to customize each one as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1194554908/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1194581269","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4871#issuecomment-1194581269","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4871","id":1194581269,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85HM90V","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-25T20:22:34Z","updated_at":"2022-07-25T20:22:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rzhang10, looks like the PR needs to be rebased for conflicts.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1194581269/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1194602870","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/5258#issuecomment-1194602870","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/5258","id":1194602870,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85HNDF2","user":{"login":"CircArgs","id":35903677,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1OTAzNjc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35903677?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CircArgs","html_url":"https://github.com/CircArgs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CircArgs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CircArgs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CircArgs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CircArgs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CircArgs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CircArgs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CircArgs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CircArgs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CircArgs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-25T20:41:33Z","updated_at":"2022-07-25T20:41:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Thanks, @CircArgs!
