@pwendell  Thanks a lot for the detailed comments. Here are some thoughts regarding the points you raised above:\n- Exposing `DataType` to users is probably not a good idea, at least not the interval JVM type. Some kind of matching against data types should be supported (IMHO). Maybe more thought could go into which part of `DataType` should be exposed? Also it seems that currently there is no notion of a primitive type as in Parquet (the closest thing to that is a `NativeType`; maybe that could be renamed or extended?). I will hold off with adding schema strings until the other APIs have stabilized somewhat. OK?\n- I have no idea why that one test failed (and can't find the error output anymore in Jenkins). Locally I cannot reproduce this failure (but other not in Jenkins show up which I believe are unrelated so I don't trust my local installation). Once this build has completed I try to find the root cause.\n- I added otherCopyArgs to the two operators; please let me know if I missed anything else.\n- About the INSERT INTO TABLE operation without overwrite:\n  - I tried to find out how Hive deals with this situation. Unless the Metastore somehow locks access to tables I don't see many checks on HDFS level (but I may have just missed them). Data is written to temporary files and then moved to its final destination, possibly renaming the destination files if they alreadt exist. We could try to implement something similar, which could mitigate (but not avoid) the concurrent write access situation.\n  - Also, data could be saved in directories only accessible to the user that created them. But that would be kind of a strong limitation.\n  - Currently the child RDD is returned unchanged, which may be different from the RDD that can be built from the Parquet files in the destination directory. This could be changed to always doing a scan after an INSERT INTO TABLE so that the actual RDD is returned. Maybe that would be less confusing to users?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/38695808/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/38695928","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/195#issuecomment-38695928","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/195","id":38695928,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4Njk1OTI4","user":{"login":"AmplabJenkins","id":4031291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzEyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4031291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/AmplabJenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-03-26T15:15:05Z","updated_at":"2014-03-26T15:15:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"

From what I can tell you've just copied the model used for ganglia and previously YARN.\n\nThe only ugliness is that SPARK_HIVE is now needed at runtime to determine whether to include  the Datanucleus jars. And this is conflated with the setting at compile-time which has a different meaning. This is a bit unfortunate - is there no better way here? We could have the assembly name be different if Hive is included, but that's sort of ugly too. We could also just include the datanucleus jars on the classpath if they are present. The only downside is that if someone did a build for hive, then did a normal build, they would still include it.

I'll change the accumulator from a `Map` to an `Array`. This implies collecting all different labels and mapping them to sequential `Int`s at the beginning and reversing that mapping at the end. I wanted to avoid this step. But after reading @mengxr complaints about the complexity of `MapAccumulator`, I think it's worthy to do it. \n2. I propose changing the interface to one `train(data, featureIndexes)` function that works out thresholds to be applied to each feature and stores them and `discretize(data)` that will apply the thresholds to the data given. The possibility of training and discretizing data being different is quite limited, since the indexes of the features to discretize have to be the same. But probably this way is clearer.\n3. My intention with `discretize` returning an `RDD[_]` was that future discretizers could be applied to data other than `LabeledPoint`s (in fact, it is placed under `mllib.regression`, so it doesn't seem to be a standard.) The reason is that labels, unlike the present case,  are not always needed to discretize.\n\nI'm going to work now on point 1, but I'll be pleased to have your opinion about the other points. If you have a different proposal for what the interface of the discretizer should be, I'm willing to discuss it and try to stick to it.\n\nPS: I'm very sorry with my mistakes concerning code conventions. I'll be more cautious on that in the future.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/38718686/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/38719417","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/168#issuecomment-38719417","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/168","id":38719417,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NzE5NDE3","user":{"login":"pwendell","id":320616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDYxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/320616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell","html_url":"https://github.com/pwendell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-03-26T18:11:29Z","updated_at":"2014-03-26T18:11:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Jenkins,

Parviz, this is great to see, but one thing I have to check is whether the Amazon Software License that amazon-kinesis-client is distributed under is okay with the Apache software foundation. Give me some time to do that. Beyond that, shouldn't you also add those dependencies to the Maven build?

Not a big deal just want to make sure we want arg vs args. I don't have a strong opinion on it but if people are used to using spark-class its just a change.\n\nIt is a bit unfortunate we still have to specify the first arg as yarn-client or yarn-cluster for the spark examples so it can pass it to SparkContext but I guess there isn't much we can do about that since if it was real user code, the user could have that hardcoded or put it as any argument (not just the first one).\n\nGreat work Sandy!
