Notice that the code attached is not working because it's only a skeleton.\r\nThis prototype uses asynchbase and tries to manage throttling issues as mentioned above. The way I do this is by limiting requests per client by 1000 (also configurable, if you want, depending on hbase capacity and response), and skipping records after reaching that threshold. Every record skipped is updated according with system timestamp, always keeping the most recent skipped record for later updates.\r\nNow, in my use case I always use a keyby -> reduce before sink, which keeps the aggregation state, meaning that every record invoked by hbase sink will have the last aggregated value from your previous operators. When all requests are done `pending == 0` I compare the last skipped record with the last requested record, if the skipped timestamp is less than the requested timestamp means that hbase has the last aggregation.\r\nThere is plenty of room for improvments, i just did'nt have the time.\r\n\r\n[HBaseSink.txt](https://github.com/apache/flink/files/1014991/HBaseSink.txt)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/302757933/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/302800197","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3703#issuecomment-302800197","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3703","id":302800197,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMjgwMDE5Nw==","user":{"login":"frankbohman","id":11501844,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTAxODQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11501844?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankbohman","html_url":"https://github.com/frankbohman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankbohman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankbohman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankbohman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankbohman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankbohman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankbohman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankbohman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankbohman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankbohman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-19T20:12:09Z","updated_at":"2017-05-19T20:12:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"where can i watch the status page-thing.. that tells us when we can get off of old 2.11 ?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/302800197/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/302848596","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3776#issuecomment-302848596","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3776","id":302848596,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMjg0ODU5Ng==","user":{"login":"Rucongzhang","id":13606366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjA2MzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13606366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rucongzhang","html_url":"https://github.com/Rucongzhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rucongzhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rucongzhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rucongzhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rucongzhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rucongzhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rucongzhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rucongzhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rucongzhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rucongzhang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-20T03:53:24Z","updated_at":"2017-05-20T03:53:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@StephanEwen , we resolve this problem.
