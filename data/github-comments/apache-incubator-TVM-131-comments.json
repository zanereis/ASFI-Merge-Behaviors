Because it uses separable convolutions instead of the more typical convolution layers in the models I've worked with it's very reasonable that data layout format might have a much smaller impact. Most recently I found that SqueezeNet takes 780ms to run in NCHW format and 182ms to run in NHWC format. It might be worth checking out your schedules on a squeezenet or vggnet (lots of standard convolutions).\r\n\r\nHi @jwfromm , thanks for you data.

Now, lets look at NHWC\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\n### NHWC (Does not work - Happens in TFLite)\r\n#### Original\r\nbias -> [C]\r\ndata -> [NHWC]\r\nconv = conv(data, weight) -> [NHWC]\r\nbias_add(conv, bias)\r\n\r\n#### After CanonicalizeOps\r\nbias -> [C]\r\ndata -> [NHWC]\r\nconv = conv(data, weight) -> [NHWC]\r\nadd(conv, bias) -> [NHWC] \r\nNothing happens here because the bias is already at the last C axis.\r\n\r\n#### After AlterOpLayout\r\nbias -> [C]\r\ndata -> [NHWC]\r\ndata_nchwc = LT(data, NHWC, NCHW16c) --> [NCHW16c]\r\nconv = conv(data, weight_transformed) -> [NCHW16c]\r\n**new_bias_nchwc = LT(new_bias, C, NCHWC16c) -> [NCHW16c]** // The problem\r\nadd(conv, bias)  -> [NCHW16c]\r\n\r\nThe problem is that LT does not support going from C to NCHW16c. This PR inserts an expand dims to make bias go to NHWC, and then call layout transform. So, this PR bring following transformation\r\nbias -> [C]\r\ndata -> [NHWC]\r\ndata_nchwc = LT(data, NHWC, NCHW16c) --> [NCHW16c]\r\nconv = conv(data, weight_transformed) -> [NCHW16c]\r\nnew_bias = expand_dims(bias, 0, 3) --> [NHWC]\r\n**new_bias_nchwc = LT(new_bias, NHWC, NCHWC16c) -> [NCHW16c]** // This is supported now\r\nadd(conv, bias)  -> [NCHW16c]\r\n\r\n## Questions to ask\r\n* Should LT (layout transform) support C to NCHW16c conversion internally? This would avoid expand_dims but make LT implementation more complex.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/537341748/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/537461048","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/3734#issuecomment-537461048","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3734","id":537461048,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNzQ2MTA0OA==","user":{"login":"umangyadav","id":29876643,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODc2NjQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29876643?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umangyadav","html_url":"https://github.com/umangyadav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umangyadav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umangyadav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umangyadav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umangyadav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umangyadav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umangyadav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umangyadav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umangyadav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umangyadav/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-02T12:03:46Z","updated_at":"2019-10-02T12:04:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> @umangyadav Thanks for the experiments.
