That's in fact, what we do now. I just want to explain, why it would be helpful to have such an extension:\r\nI have about 20 Wicket-Applications developed by several teams sharing several libraries of wicket-components. These \"central\" libraries use IInitializers. So the code #Application.getMarkupSettings().setMarkupFactory(new AriaAwareMarkupFactory()) is now located in one of theselibraries. But if I want to add processing of MarkupFilters in another library, then I cannot use this initialization-code anymore: two Initializers setting a new MarkupFacatory => only one wins and the other functionality is lost. This means, that all 20 Applications have to implement a new MarkupFactory that implements both functionalities, or I have to add a dependency between libraries. Both solutions are not nice.\r\nAdding to possibility to add IMarkupFilters without replacing the instance of the MarkupFactory makes initialization much easier in such a case.
