It does involve a `toStruct` call, but that's probably not more expensive than creating the String representation.\r\n\r\nThe immutability benefit for me is related to reasoning about the code. If fields are mutable, then you have to take the time to check who is changing them in the path from when they are created to when they are serialized. The reason for removing `setVersion` is similar. The code now makes the intent more explicit (IMO). Having said that, we do have to evaluate the benefits against the cost so we'll see.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/281421671/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/281432565","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2580#issuecomment-281432565","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2580","id":281432565,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MTQzMjU2NQ==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-21T18:26:37Z","updated_at":"2017-02-21T18:26:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nRefer to this link for build results (access rights to CI server needed): \nhttps://builds.apache.org/job/kafka-pr-jdk7-scala2.10/1781/\nTest PASSed (JDK 7 and Scala 2.10).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/281432565/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/281438489","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2560#issuecomment-281438489","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2560","id":281438489,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MTQzODQ4OQ==","user":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-21T18:47:08Z","updated_at":"2017-02-21T18:47:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Let me try to clarify a bunch of comments above regarding `activeStateRestorers`.\r\n\r\n1. When we are about to write the checkpoint file, currently the logic is that if we have the corresponding partition in `ackedOffsets`, in which case at least one record is written to the changelog topic after restoration. If yes use that value; otherwise check the `restoredOffsets` which is populated during the restoration process. I thought it is sufficient to cover the case that \r\n\r\n```\r\n// save the restorer for later if it is persistent as we might\r\n// need to retrieve the checkpoint offset (in the case where it is never updated during processing).\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I feel it is not necessary to add another `activeStateRestorers`.\r\n\r\n2. In the patch it seems we no longer populate the `restoredOffsets`, as it is moved into `StateRestorer` as `restoredOffset`. So it seems this line\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2560/files#diff-cc98a6c20f2a8483e1849aea6921c34dL370\r\n\r\nis not useful anymore. And I thought we can just use `StateRestorer#restoredOffset` instead, and hence we can get rid of the `activeStateRestorers`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/281438489/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/281440430","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2580#issuecomment-281440430","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2580","id":281440430,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MTQ0MDQzMA==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-21T18:52:59Z","updated_at":"2017-02-21T18:52:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nRefer

- i think i've addressed all but one of your comments.\r\n\r\nThe one comment i haven't addressed is to do with moving `StoreChangelogReader#validatePartitionExists` into `StoreChangelogReader#register`.  I mostly agree with you, but i don't agree with the part about standby tasks. StandbyTasks are never restored in this manner and it doesn't make any sense to me to have them registered with the `StoreChangelogReader`. During `ProcessorStateManager#register` if the task `isStandby` we only need to valid the partition exists and register the callback. All updating of standby tasks is currently done by `ProcessorStateManager#updateStandbyTasks` As you know this method is called with `List<ConsumerRecord>` to be applied. To move this logic into the `StoreChangelogReader` is not right IMHO.\r\nSo, I can think of two possiblities:\r\n1. Leave it as is\r\n2. extract another class that just does the validation\r\n\r\nThoughts?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/281686552/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/281690899","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2580#issuecomment-281690899","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2580","id":281690899,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MTY5MDg5OQ==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-22T14:52:18Z","updated_at":"2017-02-22T14:52:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nRefer

I could update the test to `waitForCondition` and give some time for the thread to terminate, but I changed the implementation to do a `join()` similar to what the producer does when force closing the I/O thread, since it is nice to have everything cleaned up before `close()` returns.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/281718471/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/281720183","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2578#issuecomment-281720183","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2578","id":281720183,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MTcyMDE4Mw==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-22T16:24:38Z","updated_at":"2017-02-22T16:24:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nRefer
