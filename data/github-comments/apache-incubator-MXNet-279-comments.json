If your computation graph does change based on sequence length, then the computation graph is a function based on input length/shape, in which case you would need to define a `sym_gen` function as you normally would when using mx.rnn. For basic usage, you can find an example at https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/example/rnn/lstm_bucketing.py#L88-L103.\r\n\r\nRegarding having CNN, there isn't anything special about adding a conv layer before the RNN layer. For example, you can use the layout (batch size, time steps, input dimensions) (i.e. `NTC`) for input data. After convolution layer, all you need to do is to make sure that the output is reshaped according to rnn API's expectation before using it to unroll the rnn cell.\r\n\r\nThe same functionality as mx.rnn can be found in `mx.gluon.rnn`. If you don't need special modification other than dropout, the rnn layers in gluon is probably the easiest to use. You can find an example at the beginning of its doc at https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/versions/master/api/python/gluon/rnn.html?highlight=gluon.rnn#recurrent-layers. This would be the closest to what caffe LSTM layer offers.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/348673299/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/348675907","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/8910#issuecomment-348675907","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/8910","id":348675907,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0ODY3NTkwNw==","user":{"login":"huyangc","id":12171570,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTcxNTcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12171570?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huyangc","html_url":"https://github.com/huyangc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huyangc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huyangc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huyangc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huyangc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huyangc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huyangc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huyangc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huyangc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huyangc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-02T07:57:53Z","updated_at":"2017-12-02T12:04:39Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"As you said, it is because of the dataiter who provides label=[] when you don't feed any label to it. \r\n\r\nJust refer to https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/python/mxnet/io.py#L652,  \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/python/mxnet/io.py#L684 and\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/python/mxnet/io.py#L707\r\n\r\nTo solve it, I think you can:\r\n- write an DataIter to wrap the NDArrayIter, just to change the ``provide_label`` to return ``None``.\r\n- Don't use the ``fit`` function, just bind the module, init_params and init_optimizer, and use forward, backward, update to train.

I used the `lstm()` and `lstm_unroll()` functions and replaced the `wordvec` with my symbol of convolutional features. The model can be trained normally, though some of the losses haven't decreased to an expected level up to now. I will give more feedback after the training finishes.\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThe solution provided by @kevinthesun is nice. But I'm not sure if it can right fit in my current code.\r\n\r\nI'm using the [R-CNN example](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/tree/master/example/rcnn) for object detection. The example provides symbol definition files of VGG-16 and ResNet, and they are called in the training script to generate the corresponding symbol, which is then initialized and passed to a module for network training. From my understanding, to use a different network, what I need to do is to provide the corresponding symbol definition file. This will leave other code untouched.\r\n\r\n@kevinthesun, if I would like to use your solution, then I will need to write a problem solver (or module) to handle the forward and backward process on my own. Am I right?\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\n@szha, your first solution uses the [RNN Cell Symbol API](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/python/symbol/rnn.html) as I requested. It is well explained and looks consistent with other symbol definitions. In this case, should I call the RNN-specific functions for model saving and loading or a normal `do_checkpoint()` is enough? And is it OK that the RNN cell variable together with the `sym_gen()` function are defined in a separate file (i.e. the file creating the module will import the `sym_gen()` from another file)?\r\n\r\nYour second solution suggests to use the `mx.gluon.rnn` from Gluon API. This seems to be a more favorable solution since both regular neural network layers and recurrent ones can be used with `mx.gluon.nn.Sequential()`. My question is: can the `mx.gluon.nn.Sequential` object be used as an MXNet symbol? More specifically, can a Gluon `Sequential` object be passed to a function that originally accepts an MXNet symbol? This is important for me since the [R-CNN example](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/tree/master/example/rcnn) that I'm using is not implemented with Gluon.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/348691102/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/348693278","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/8910#issuecomment-348693278","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/8910","id":348693278,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0ODY5MzI3OA==","user":{"login":"adrianloy","id":19349042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzQ5MDQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19349042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrianloy","html_url":"https://github.com/adrianloy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrianloy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrianloy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrianloy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrianloy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrianloy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrianloy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrianloy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrianloy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrianloy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-02T13:49:03Z","updated_at":"2017-12-02T13:52:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for your help.
