- If you have any guidance on fixing this I'd be happy to submit a PR.  At the moment, I'm confused on the intent of the code.  `caravel.models.Database` has class attributes `sqlalchemy_uri` and `password`.  At initialization `utils.get_or_create_main_db` sets `dbobj.sqlalchemy_uri = config.get(\"SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI\")` and at this point the \"dbs\" entry for \"main\" has the full values for `sqlalchemy_uri` and null for `password`.\n\nLater in `caravel.views.DatabaseView` the method `pre_add` modifies `db.sqlalchemy_uri` to mask the password.  But this is not called in the course of `caravel init`.  (At least, I put a breakpoint there and it was never triggered.)  Is the intent that the call to `appbuilder.add_view(DatabaseView, ...)` would trigger `pre_add`?  In the Flask-AppBuilder source I only see `pre_add` called in [RestCRUDView.api_create](https://github.com/dpgaspar/Flask-AppBuilder/blob/3af7f2bce07f1ed7e70373311c3ced2c639871e9/flask_appbuilder/views.py#L270) and in [BaseCRUDView._add](https://github.com/dpgaspar/Flask-AppBuilder/blob/af095ac4094d068fa2dd467bd01fa8b95d697fc1/flask_appbuilder/baseviews.py#L910), both handlers of POST requests.\n\nSo calls to `Database.sqlalchemy_uri_decrypted` loses the password (since `password` is None) and calls to `safe_sqlalchemy_uri` returns the full string with the password.\n\nSince a recent commit https://github.com/airbnb/caravel/commit/6aadc6ec1373d5a6bb46c1485f744ac806ea9729#diff-397111749c5081b0f26dfa6ac13430dcL896 the command `caravel load_examples` fails with this stacktrace:\n\n```\nLoading examples into <SQLA engine=u'mysql://mysqladmin:FIXME_12345@127.0.0.1:3306/db'>\nCreating default CSS templates\nLoading energy related dataset\nCreating table [wb_health_population] reference\n2016-09-14 11:15:27,603:INFO:root:Creating database reference\n2016-09-14 11:15:27,607:INFO:root:mysql://mysqladmin:FIXME_12345@127.0.0.1:3306/db\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/home/dobrien/anaconda3/envs/caraveldev/bin/caravel\", line 6, in <module>\n    exec(compile(open(__file__).read(), __file__, 'exec'))\n  File \"/home/dobrien/workspace/github/caravel/caravel/bin/caravel\", line 152, in <module>\n    manager.run()\n  File \"/home/dobrien/anaconda3/envs/caraveldev/lib/python2.7/site-packages/Flask_Script-2.0.5-py2.7.egg/flask_script/__init__.py\", line 412, in run\n    result = self.handle(sys.argv[0], sys.argv[1:])\n  File \"/home/dobrien/anaconda3/envs/caraveldev/lib/python2.7/site-packages/Flask_Script-2.0.5-py2.7.egg/flask_script/__init__.py\", line 383, in handle\n    res = handle(*args, **config)\n  File \"/home/dobrien/anaconda3/envs/caraveldev/lib/python2.7/site-packages/Flask_Script-2.0.5-py2.7.egg/flask_script/commands.py\", line 216, in __call__\n    return self.run(*args, **kwargs)\n  File \"/home/dobrien/workspace/github/caravel/caravel/bin/caravel\", line 91, in load_examples\n    data.load_energy()\n  File \"/home/dobrien/workspace/github/caravel/caravel/data/__init__.py\", line 71, in load_energy\n    tbl.fetch_metadata()\n  File \"/home/dobrien/workspace/github/caravel/caravel/models.py\", line 906, in fetch_metadata\n    \"Table doesn't seem to exist in the specified database, \"\nException: Table doesn't seem to exist in the specified database, couldn't fetch column information\n```\n\nI think previous to this commit it was failing silently here.  So this is a good thing.\n\nMaybe the easiest fix is to move the password masking work from `pre_add` to `get_or_create_main_db`.  I'm open to ideas/guidance and would be happy to put together a PR.\n\nthanks,\nDennis\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/247111179/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/247119990","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/1070#issuecomment-247119990","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/1070","id":247119990,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NzExOTk5MA==","user":{"login":"xrmx","id":12932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx","html_url":"https://github.com/xrmx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-14T19:03:41Z","updated_at":"2016-09-14T19:03:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@dennisobrien as you already have a testcase in #1092, whatever will make it work would be an improvement on current state of affairs :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/247119990/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/247126859","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/1070#issuecomment-247126859","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/1070","id":247126859,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NzEyNjg1OQ==","user":{"login":"bkyryliuk","id":5727938,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Mjc5Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5727938?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk","html_url":"https://github.com/bkyryliuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-14T19:28:32Z","updated_at":"2016-09-14T19:28:32Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@dennisobrien - I'll have a chance to take a better look closer to the end of the week.\nThanks for the detailed stacktraces and scripts.\n\nWe are using caravel with mysql and passwords in our production.

original intent was to test SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI with a username and password as a test for #1070 (sorry @xrmx -- I only realized after that I could have run the same tests Travis runs on my own machine).\n\nThe follow up commits address #1070 \n- At initialization `utils.get_or_create_main_db` calls `dbobj.set_sqlalchemy_uri(config.get(\"SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI\"))`\n- `caravel.models.Database.set_sqlalchemy_uri` stores the password-masked uri in the field `sqlalchemy_uri` and the encrypted password in `password`.\n- That logic was removed from `caravel.views.DatabaseView.pre_add`.\n  - There is still one line in `pre_add` that I did not move because I don't know where it belongs: `utils.merge_perm(sm, 'database_access', db.perm)`\n- This refactor broke `testconn` so I made some changes here:\n  - Include `database_name` in the json payload.\n  - If `uri` is the same as `database.safe_sqlalchemy_uri()`, use the stored `database.sqlalchemy_uri_decrypted()`.\n  - Otherwise, assume the user is trying a different connection string and test that.\n  - I really don't know if this is an important feature but it's probably good to respect the user's intent and give accurate feedback.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/247193308/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/247254511","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/1092#issuecomment-247254511","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/1092","id":247254511,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NzI1NDUxMQ==","user":{"login":"xrmx","id":12932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx","html_url":"https://github.com/xrmx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-15T07:17:04Z","updated_at":"2016-09-15T07:19:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@dennisobrien
