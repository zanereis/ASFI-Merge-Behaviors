I should have used `cloneEmpty()`. This is a problem with not being able to run the pre-commit tests, I can't catch such bone-headed errors...\r\n\r\nSecond, the `clone()` method does not even make sense. It will clear out child fields for the `MaterializedField`, but *not* the subtypes for the major type. This is very likely a bug. Why have we never caught it? Turns out that `clone()` is not called.\r\n\r\nThe same bug exists for all of the `withPathAndType()` variations: we preserve subtypes. But, the semantics of the (mostly broken) union vectors appear to want a new vector to be given a materialized field without subtypes; subtypes are added later as the types are needed. Is that behavior itself a bug or a feature? We can't be sure because union vectors are not supported my much of Drill.\r\n\r\nThis makes this a hard case. Since the behavior is murky, I'd suggest leaving well enough alone, and just fixing the one problem we know about: passing a fully-populated materialized field to a new vector.\r\n\r\nMight be worthwhile filing a JIRA to track this issue. (Though, we never seem to fix such tickets...)\r\n\r\nRunning tests with the other PR (with the above fix) should tell us if the fix works, since that PR found the issue.\r\n\r\nTo your fundamental question, please see the discussion in the original PR and in the description for details. The story is, in essence:\r\n\r\n* There is a fully-built vector coming into the partitioner.\r\n* When that incoming vector was built, the code for a map added children to the `MaterializedField`, and for unions, added a subtype to the `MajorType`.\r\n* For whatever reason, the partition wants to make a new copy of that vector using the same structure.\r\n* If we reuse the same vector, then the new code will modify it as we build up the maps or unions, causing concurrent modifications to the source vector's field while building the destination.\r\n* If we do a simple copy, we'll carry over child fields and subtypes, which will likely cause problems as we build up the new vector's structure.\r\n\r\nThe original code would only work for non-nullable, fixed-width types (with no internal structure) I have no idea why it started to fail with my result set loader changes. Probably because, to get things to work, I had to fix bugs in the vector code in which we were not properly maintaining the material field structure, which caused problems with the new code tried to copy a vector structure to create the \"overflow vector.\"","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/404387515/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/404465852","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1298#issuecomment-404465852","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1298","id":404465852,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNDQ2NTg1Mg==","user":{"login":"jbimbert","id":7976371,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NzYzNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7976371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbimbert","html_url":"https://github.com/jbimbert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbimbert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbimbert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbimbert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbimbert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbimbert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbimbert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbimbert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbimbert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbimbert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-12T10:23:48Z","updated_at":"2018-07-12T10:23:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Checkstyle passed on modifications.

I found a few more places where methods previously expected to print to stdout, so I ended up changing more methods to make log and print versions of the methods available. Now the scope of the PR is:\r\n\r\n- **VectorUtil.showVectorAccessibleContent()** uses a logger and has been renamed to **VectorUtil.logVectorAccessibleContent()**. Additionally the missing log statement was added.\r\n- Print and log variants of methods were created for BaseTestQuery.printResult(), QueryUtils. testRunAndPrint(), QueryBuilder.print(), ClusterTest.runAndLog(), ClientFixture.runQueriesAndLog(). Log methods output to the default log appender. Print methods allow a selected few loggers to output directly to stdout allowing results to be printed to the console for debugging. Log method variants can be called from tests and left in test code. Print method variants should only be used for debugging tests and should not be committed.\r\n- LoggingResultsListener was created in addition to the PrintingResultsListener in order to enable the creation of log and print variants of all methods that output results.\r\n- PrintingUtils.java was added in order to encapsulate the code for turning on logging to stdout, so the same boilerplate is not repeated everywhere.\r\n- Removed obsolete QueryTestUtil.TEST_QUERY_PRINTING_SILENT property. All code should use loggers which are silent by default, and the LogFixture or XXXprintXXX methods can be used to output results to the console for debugging if the developer desires.\r\n- Added some more documentation for logging.\r\n\r\nDisallowing System.out will be done in this Jira https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DRILL-6464\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have anymore comments.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/404696194/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/404713253","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1367#issuecomment-404713253","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1367","id":404713253,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNDcxMzI1Mw==","user":{"login":"sohami","id":22159459,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTU5NDU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22159459?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohami","html_url":"https://github.com/sohami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-13T03:14:17Z","updated_at":"2018-07-13T03:14:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@paul-rogers - I have couple of questions related to this change and your last comment:\r\n1) I don't understand what you mean by `clone` method will clear out the child field. Isn't `MaterializedField::clone` is taking care of [cloning the children fields](https://github.com/apache/drill/blob/master/exec/vector/src/main/java/org/apache/drill/exec/record/MaterializedField.java#L145) as well ? Instead `cloneEmpty` is throwing away the children fields.\r\n\r\n2) The main issue with the original PR and the logic of building outgoing batch from incoming batch of Partition Sender is something like below:\r\n\r\n- In original PR there is a change for NullableValueVectors to add the `values` and `bits` vector materialized field as child field of parent vector field. See [here](https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1244/files#diff-646d5ac291e14369d72634752edaae84R111). From your comment it looks like because the internal `values` ValueVector mode needs to be required so you are creating another Materialized Field with that mode for internal `values` vector and adding it as child of parent vector field. But AFAIK based on the usage seen, the children of a Materialized Field is only used in case of container Type vector like Map not in case of composite vector like NullableValueVectors. For those the internal `values` and `bits` vector holds on to the parent Materialized Field. Now with change even for Nullable ValueVectors the children component of parent field will be populated. This will probably affect the serde component and compatibility too ?\r\n\r\n- Now coming to the main issue. Earlier for each incoming of the partition sender, there are multiple threads which are trying to create outgoing batches but using the same Materialized from incoming batch vectors. Since outgoing batch will have same schema as incoming batch.\r\n\r\n- When a ValueVector in incoming batch is of Map type then while creating a new ValueVector of Map type in outgoing batch it passes the Materialized Field from input Map Vector. In the constructor of [AbstractMapVector](https://github.com/apache/drill/blob/master/exec/vector/src/main/java/org/apache/drill/exec/vector/complex/AbstractMapVector.java#L49), it clones the input field and then iterate over the children of **not** the cloned field but the original input field (which is from same incoming vector). This looks to be a bug where it should [iterate on cloned field children rather than input field children](https://github.com/apache/drill/blob/master/exec/vector/src/main/java/org/apache/drill/exec/vector/complex/AbstractMapVector.java#L51).\r\n\r\n- With above if there is a child of the Map vector which is of Nullable type, then that child vector will get reference to the children field from actual input field to parent MapVector (not the reference to cloned children field).\r\n\r\n- With [new change](https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1244/files#diff-646d5ac291e14369d72634752edaae84R111) in NullableValueVector it will try to modify it's input Materialized Field to add children for `bit` and `values` vector field.\r\n\r\n- So combination of above bug in Map vector and the new change will cause the concurrent modification exception as NullableValueVector child of MapVector will modify the Materialized field of incoming ValueVector not the new clone Materialized Field created for the outgoing vector.\r\n\r\nWith your current fix I think you should still use `clone` instead of `cloneEmpty` since we need to preserve the children information too in outgoing batches of PartitionSender.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/404713253/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/404718050","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1307#issuecomment-404718050","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1307","id":404718050,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNDcxODA1MA==","user":{"login":"sohami","id":22159459,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTU5NDU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22159459?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohami","html_url":"https://github.com/sohami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-13T03:52:14Z","updated_at":"2018-07-13T03:52:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@arina-ielchiieva / @vdiravka - From the comments and changes looks like this change is ready to merge but there is no ready-to-commit label in JIRA so I have not picked it.

Unfortunately, I cannot debug the use case and so you may have a deeper understanding than I do. I'm working from experience gained some six months ago when working with the result set loader, and that knowledge is getting rusty.\r\n\r\n> In original PR there is a change for NullableValueVectors to add the values and bits vector materialized field as child field of parent vector field. ... From your comment it looks like because the internal values ValueVector mode needs to be required so you are creating another Materialized Field with that mode for internal values vector and adding it as child of parent vector field.\r\n\r\nThe reason for that change is that the result set loader code that clones a vector needs to know the actual type. That code walks the vector tree, using the `MaterializedField` to get the type. If a `values` vector (which has no `bits` vector) reports its type as `Nullable`, then the clone will create a `bits` vector, which causes havoc.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking that I should change the cloning code. Rather than believing the `MaterializedField`, I can use the vector class type itself. That will be more clunky and slow, but it will eliminate the need to change the existing vector code.\r\n\r\nGiven how long this discussion has gone on, that I can't do the required tests, and that we can't we discuss this in person, I'm thinking that the alternative approach may be more expedient.\r\n\r\nI suppose a larger question is whether the final bits of the result set loader are even still useful. Much work has been done on batch sizing since this work started. Is it still worth while finishing up this code so we can control the batch size for readers? Parquet has its own solution. Is it worth worrying about the others?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/404987283/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/404987313","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1367#issuecomment-404987313","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1367","id":404987313,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNDk4NzMxMw==","user":{"login":"paul-rogers","id":3248881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDg4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3248881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers","html_url":"https://github.com/paul-rogers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-14T01:01:34Z","updated_at":"2018-07-14T01:01:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closing this PR.

I've closed that PR and will look for another solution. Rather than use the `MaterializedField` to get the type, I'll ad code that does a switch statement on the vector type to learn the \"real\" type, leaving the `MaterializedField` to hold the pretend type for the `values` field of a `Nullable` vector.\r\n\r\nThis should not be hard: we already have generated code that parses the vector type.

The reason for that change is that the result set loader code that clones a vector needs to know the actual type. That code walks the vector tree, using the MaterializedField to get the type. If a values vector (which has no bits vector) reports its type as Nullable, then the clone will create a bits vector, which causes havoc.\r\n\r\nAs of now NullableVectors takes care of creating it's internal `values` and `bits` vector correctly. That is to say it creates correct `values` vector of required type even though the MaterializedField of that vector points to parent field. \r\nWhen you traverse the MaterializedField tree to construct a new vector based on it, for Nullable Vector without your change will not have any children fields. So probably based on DataMode of Materialized Field you will know that the vector is of Nullable Type and you will create a NullableValueVector.  Internally this NullableValueVector should create correct `values` vector (i.e. without bit vector) even though it's field will be same as parent NullableVector field. I don't think you have to create `values` vector separately ? May be I am missing something, would be helpful if you can point me to cloning code inside ResultSetLoader.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/405302803/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/405387336","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1114#issuecomment-405387336","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1114","id":405387336,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNTM4NzMzNg==","user":{"login":"cgivre","id":5513150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTMxNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5513150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre","html_url":"https://github.com/cgivre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-16T21:26:44Z","updated_at":"2018-07-16T21:26:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I fixed several of the comments here.

Doing so would trigger the operator state to be BatchState.FIRST after calling buildSchema which would cause an **OK_SCHEMA** to NOT be sent. This then cause downstream operators to never build a correct schema and return incorrect data types in some cases. That was the crux of the issue.\r\n\r\nThis change fixes that issue by separating prefetching data to two phases:\r\n\r\n  - Schema sniffing\r\n  - Data sniffing\r\n\r\nThe schemas need to be sniffed in the buildSchema call so we can have the schema. After sniffing schemas that state of the operator is BUILD_SCHEMA and OK_NEW_SCHEMA is emitted. Then data sniffing needs to happen in the call to innerNext() after the operator has emitted an OK_NEW_SCHEMA message.\r\n\r\nOther binary operators don't have this issue because they don't live within their memory limit, and as a consequence do not need to collect statistics about the data through sniffing.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, doing the sniffing in two stages is not a hack. It is required for functional correctness for queries like the one added in the unit test and for the reasons described above.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/406432426/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/406440668","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1387#issuecomment-406440668","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1387","id":406440668,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNjQ0MDY2OA==","user":{"login":"vrozov","id":12200381,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjAwMzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12200381?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov","html_url":"https://github.com/vrozov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-19T23:06:32Z","updated_at":"2018-07-19T23:06:32Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@arina-ielchiieva The goal of the comments is to avoid the same happening in the future (not to fix something that is already done, so no need to revert the commit, especially that it fixes DRILL-6603) whether it is for PR that I review or it is reviewed by somebody else (in Apex, for example, there is a [merging PR rule](http://apex.apache.org/contributing.html) that a PR can't be merged unless all reviewers sign off with a grace period of 48 hours.)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/406440668/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
