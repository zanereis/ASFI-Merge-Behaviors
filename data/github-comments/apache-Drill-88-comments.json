think that the upgrade of calcite solves the problem. I can see that apache drill 1.21.2 it's using calcite 1.34.0. I'm doing some tests overriding the 1.34.0 calcite with 1.38.0 and if i only upgrade `calcite-elasticsearch-1.38.0.jar` i can do a `show schemas;` query without any problem but i still can't do any select from an elastic index. I also try to upgrade the 4 calcite jars inside 3rd party folder but i've receive another error. So i understand that apache drill 1.21.2 it's not ready to work with calcite 1.38.0 right?\n\nIt's any way to upgrade calcite 1.34.0 without breaking apache drill?\n\nThanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/2606935016/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/2607258365","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/issues/2975#issuecomment-2607258365","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2975","id":2607258365,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAFa5xc6bZ5r9","user":{"login":"cgivre","id":5513150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTMxNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5513150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre","html_url":"https://github.com/cgivre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-22T13:31:11Z","updated_at":"2025-01-22T13:31:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@dceldran I started working on that but I ran into some issues.
