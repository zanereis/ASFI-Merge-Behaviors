I am 👍 on the change but should there be a release notes tag? My auto firehose to input source converter got caught out by this.\r\n\r\n@vogievetsky — \"auto firehose to input source converter\" sounds a bit scary, I don't think special effort was put into making the sources consistent with the firehoses (rather, I believe the effort was instead put into making them consistent _with other input sources_). So there may be other pitfalls if you are assuming they can be converted without special knowledge of the specific source type.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/557774609/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/557779557","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/8903#issuecomment-557779557","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8903","id":557779557,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1Nzc3OTU1Nw==","user":{"login":"vogievetsky","id":177816,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzgxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177816?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky","html_url":"https://github.com/vogievetsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-23T08:47:47Z","updated_at":"2019-11-23T08:47:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@gianm I made a thing that if you paste in a firehose based input spec into the data loader it will be magically converted to an input source based one.

So this will stay for the time being.\r\n     -->\r\n    <prerequisites>\r\n        <maven>3.2.0</maven>\r\n    </prerequisites>\r\n```\r\nThis warning wants us to remove the <prerequisites … /> specification.  We already use the enforcer plugin.  But this causes another failure with the “mvn versions” command.  \r\nThis is essentially a bug in Maven.\r\n\r\n#### Unused Dependencies found\r\n```\r\n  [WARNING] Unused declared dependencies found:\r\n  [WARNING]    org.slf4j:slf4j-simple:jar:1.7.27:test\r\n```\r\nThe reason we added the org.slf4j:slf4j-simple:jar:1.7.27 to the dependencies was to eliminate a warning every time we run the test suite that the “slf4j-api” was not being supplied with an implementation thus the slf4j becomes a No-op.\r\n\r\nAgain, this is another \"catch-22\" where trying to clean up one warning now causes another warning.\r\nBoth of these warnings relate to harmless issues.\r\n\r\n### OPENJDK8 OTHER MODULES TEST:\r\n### OPENJDK11 OTHER MODUES TEST:\r\n### OPENJDK8 OTHER MODULES TEST (SQL Compatibility):\r\n### OPENJDK11 OTHER MODULES TEST (SQL Compatibility):\r\n\r\nAll of these are caused by the fact that the old com.yahoo.sketches.* code is still in the system and not \r\nreplaced by the new org.apache.datasketches.* code.\r\n\r\n### Conclusion:\r\nIt appears that by updating the `licenses.yaml` and `pom.xml` files should eliminate all the errors except for the `\\<prerequisites>` specification and the `Unused dependencies found` warnings.  These relate to harmless issues that I hope you could ignore.  Otherwise we will have to go though yet another Full Apache release to fix those, (which cause other problems).\r\n\r\nYour help in expediting this would be greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nLee. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/557827131/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/557827670","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/8647#issuecomment-557827670","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8647","id":557827670,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NzgyNzY3MA==","user":{"login":"leerho","id":12941506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTQxNTA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12941506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leerho","html_url":"https://github.com/leerho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leerho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leerho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leerho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leerho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leerho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leerho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leerho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leerho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leerho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-23T19:49:41Z","updated_at":"2019-11-23T19:49:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@gianm \r\n\r\nAs you your earlier question of why the old datasketches code seems to work under JDK11, I have a pretty good guess.  \r\n\r\nIt turns out that Druid does not actually use the advanced capability of Memory to allocate memory off heap, e.g. `WritableMemory.allocateDirect(size)`.  Because all of your creation of off-heap memory is via ByteBuffer, and not utilizing these functions in Memory directly.    \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, we do use Unsafe functions for reading and writing primitives, which, for the time-being are deprecated but still exist in the JDK11.
