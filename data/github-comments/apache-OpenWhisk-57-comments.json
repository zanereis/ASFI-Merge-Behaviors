comments @csantanapr. We can add CORS support - it's in the controller already, just have to wrap these new routes with it -- I think at cursory glance. Yes images could be supported. I opted not to include it here but did try it (with an svg). I agree on POST but adding it without supporting form-urlencoded input will be broken, so we'll have to add both at once. Lastly, it's .js not .json deliberately. This is raised by Markus also. It would make projecting a JSON value (string) for example an error (one must use a text extension - similarly for the other value types). So it's a convenience so that if one is projecting top level fields or nested fields they're not constantly changing both the extension and the projection at the same time. I can be swayed toward stricter form though. I'd like to consider all but the last as additive features to address as future enhancements.\r\n\r\nEDIT: convinced `.js` renamed to `.json` - and magic removed @csantanapr
