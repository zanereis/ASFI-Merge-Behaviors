Under Python 2.7, when I try to view `example_python_operator` and capture the values of the `task_ids` in `airflow/models.py:latest_execution_date`, they are all `str` (the expected behavior), not `newbytes`.\n\nHere's what I'm doing, maybe you could do the same -- I'm sorry if this is more spelunking than you signed up for! You'll need `ipdb` (`pip install ipdb` if you don't have it). Your traceback shows line 1619 of `models.py` creating the error (the one that says `TI.task_id.in_(self.task_ids)`). If you go three lines above that (just after the one that creates the `session`), you can add a new line: \n\n``` python\nsession = ...\nimport ipdb; ipdb.set_trace() # new line\n...\n```\n\nSave the file and start up the webserver again. Now when you try to view the DAG, your terminal (whichever one you started the webserver in) will open up a debugging window where you added the breakpoint. What is the output of typing `type(self.task_ids[0])`? I get `str`, but I think you must be getting `newbytes`... next step would be to figure out why.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/137756776/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/137759204","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/332#issuecomment-137759204","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/332","id":137759204,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNzc1OTIwNA==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-04T14:57:49Z","updated_at":"2015-09-04T14:57:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"8ab666cc7a59fad206524c65921a9e41cb5dc6c1\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/137759204/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/137779324","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/360#issuecomment-137779324","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/360","id":137779324,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNzc3OTMyNA==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-04T16:11:48Z","updated_at":"2015-09-04T16:11:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Totally.

There's also a mechanism by which task instances emit a regular heartbeat so that we can identify zombie tasks, that's all part of the wrapping and there are strong assumptions there.

In my experience, there often exist entire \"plates\" of tasks that you'd like to repeat for a series of triggers, while using dag logic like Airflow's to resolve dependencies within each plate.  Airflow's DAGs represent blocks of known dependencies that are symmetric when unrolled over time; these \"plates\" are just the same thing unrolled over some axis other than time.\n\nLetting us define a DAG once but then manually schedule it would maintain the invariant that the entire structure is known in between runs.  Since task lists would be invariant, the cool analytics across instances would still work.  (IMO these analytics are a killer feature for AirFlow, and unfortunately the \"dynamically generate a new DAG for each run\" approach above would lose that.)  If we could stamp an arbitrary label on these runs/instances, and/or have another way of passing some metadata into them that would be accessible to operators in the `context` variable, my life would be complete!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/139378987/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/139415836","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/377#issuecomment-139415836","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/377","id":139415836,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzOTQxNTgzNg==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-11T00:11:04Z","updated_at":"2015-09-11T00:11:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I

Many companies run workflows whenever a batch shows up and instantiate a dag for each batch.\n\nI think there's potentially two new things here: \"externally triggered DAGs\", assuming a similar DAG structure across instances, and \"singleton DAGs\" that may have a very different shape over different instances, so much so that we may want different dag_ids to represent them.\n\nThe \"externally triggered DAGs\" could be implemented fairly easily by:\n- adding a DAG level parameter `externally_triggered=True` \n- creating a new metadata table that would associate a `batch_id` to a specific timestamp `trigger_dttm`\n- altering the tree view's x axis to deal with variable schedule interval\n- altering the scheduler and dependency engine to understand that it needs to look at the  batch_id table to move in time and find previous and next runs\n- exposing way to trigger a batch_id (REST/CLI)\n- ...\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/139419893/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/139423293","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/379#issuecomment-139423293","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/379","id":139423293,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzOTQyMzI5Mw==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-11T01:12:48Z","updated_at":"2015-09-11T01:12:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"![img](http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/thumbs_up_okay_daft_punk.gif)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/139423293/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/139442498","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/289#issuecomment-139442498","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/289","id":139442498,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzOTQ0MjQ5OA==","user":{"login":"georgebdavis","id":1571534,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzE1MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1571534?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgebdavis","html_url":"https://github.com/georgebdavis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgebdavis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgebdavis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgebdavis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgebdavis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgebdavis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgebdavis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgebdavis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgebdavis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgebdavis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-11T03:22:47Z","updated_at":"2015-09-11T03:22:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks @mistercrunch.
