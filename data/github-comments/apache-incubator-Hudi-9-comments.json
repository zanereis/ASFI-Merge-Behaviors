There is a CLI command.. \r\n - you can always just use the datasource and wrap it in your own Spark job. \r\n\r\nActually there is planned work to rework the deltastreamer to simply use Spark data source API and move away from RDD level APIs it uses. That should fix most of your first two issues.. How hard is it for you to try the datasource api in the mean time? Longer term, we are planning integrations with Apache Gobblin and also uber's own ingestion system would be open sourced soon - which will work with Hoodie out-of-box.
