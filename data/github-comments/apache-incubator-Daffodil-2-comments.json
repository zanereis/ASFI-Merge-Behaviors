The best we could probably do is create an SBT plugin that the DFDL Schema projects use, and that plugin could be manually updated to match the Daffodil version. Then it just becomes a matter of updating that plugin. But that's kindof odd behavior for a plugin. It doesn't really do anything, just sets a bunch of default parameters. And it still requires people to update the plugin version to get the new settings. So still a somewhat manual process.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure there's a great solution to that problem.

I think this change can only improve performance, because instead of calling ThreadLocal.get (which calls a hashTable get), we're just directly accessing the state we already have.\r\n\r\nI entirely agree the pools leak stuff should go. \r\n\r\nSome pools are \"disciplined\", and a macro that does the get and release could be created - I did a little web surfing about that. The now-called dfaRegisterPool is exactly this case. This is a replacement for the C++ use of an automatic/local variable that is a struct. That's all we're looking for with that sort of pool. We just want an object for a little local use. In this case using a macro that lays down a try/finally is actually adding a bunch of overhead we don't want. I'd prefer to have a macro that does the get and release, so you don't have to remember, but which doesn't use a try-catch, along with a checker at end of parse/unparse that does both a check to see if you've leaked them and resets the pool so there can't be subsequent interactions ever. \r\n\r\nThe less-disciplined pools e.g., for marks and such in the I/O system, those are just harder, but we should actually measure if they are saving us anything.

back to this to add some negative tests, and I dont' think this is really the complete solution. This change still allows coercion in the case where the target type and the expression result type are both numeric. This is clearly wrong in the case of decimal numbers, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<xs:element name=\"a\" type=\"xs:int\" dfdl:inputValueCalc=\"{ 2.5 }\" />\r\n```\r\nIn this case, we really do not want to coerce 2.5 to an int, but this change would coerce since both are numerics.  An alternative might be to require that types match exactly, but then usability suffers. For example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<xs:element name=\"a\" type=\"xs:int\" dfdl:inputValueCalc=\"{ 2 }\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, the literal 2 is technically an xs:integer so the result type and target type do not match. So if we were strict about it, this simple expression requires the use of ``xs:int(2)``. That's not terrible, but there's a good chance we would probably break a lot of schemas.\r\n\r\nPerhaps a happy medium is to allow coercion between integer-like things? So we would automatically coerece an xs:integer to an xs:int (as long as the value was in range), but would not coerece 2.5 to 2, for example. An odd side effect of this is that one could know do this:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<xs:element name=\"a\" type=\"xs:int\" dfdl:inputValueCalc=\"{ xs:integer(2) }\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd we would happily coerce that, even though it seems like maybe the user intended something else since types are explicitly provided and differ. Perhaps a better solution exists? I think it would be difficult track track when types are explicit and only check in those cases, so maybe this edge case isn't worth solving.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/451214473/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/451219295","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/159#issuecomment-451219295","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/159","id":451219295,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MTIxOTI5NQ==","user":{"login":"mbeckerle","id":1524099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1524099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle","html_url":"https://github.com/mbeckerle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-03T17:38:30Z","updated_at":"2019-01-03T17:38:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"In what way is the expression 2 not an xs:int ?

looks like this change now causes a single test to fail:\r\n```org.apache.daffodil.section23.dfdl_expressions.TestDFDLExpressions.test_int_constructor_04```\r\n\r\nThe test expects the string \"expression evaluation error\". It used to get this error message:\r\n\r\n> Parse Error: Cannot convert 'not an int!' from String type to Long (Cannot convert to type long: For input string: \"not an int!\"). (within Expression Evaluation Error: Cannot convert 'not an int!' from String type to Long (Cannot convert to type long: For input string: \"not an int!\").\r\n\r\nBut it now gets just this:\r\n\r\n> Parse Error: Cannot convert 'not an int!' from String type to Long (Cannot convert to type long: For input string: \"not an int!\").\r\n\r\nSo we're losing the information that the parse error actually occurred in an expression evaluation error. There's definiately a lot of redundancy in that error message, but that fact that it occurred in an expression is useful information that I don't think we want to lose. Perhaps there's a different underlying issue here, like something using ProcessingError incorrectly? The bug mentions it's that maybeFormatString and maybeCause shouldn't both be passed in? Ifsomethign is using this incorrectly, maybe combining the paramters into a single paramter that is an ``Either[String,Throwable]`` would the type system figure out where we're doing something wrong.\r\n\r\nIt would also be helpful if you could add a tdml test that reproduces the bad error so that we can ensure the test is fixed and does not regress in the future.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/474352208/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/474395380","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/201#issuecomment-474395380","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/201","id":474395380,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NDM5NTM4MA==","user":{"login":"bsloane1650","id":1839120,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzkxMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1839120?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsloane1650","html_url":"https://github.com/bsloane1650","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsloane1650/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsloane1650/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsloane1650/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsloane1650/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsloane1650/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsloane1650/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsloane1650/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsloane1650/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsloane1650/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-19T14:28:40Z","updated_at":"2019-03-19T14:35:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@stevedlawrence \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the original error (which caused the poorly behaving Parse error) was in simply broken code so I don't know of any way to trigger it from a TDML. I can probably create a unit test that exersises that particular error path.\r\n\r\nUpdating the type to be an Either type seems like the correct solution. However, as we are in the runtime system, I am wondering if the use of Maybe here was a deliberate choice for performance reasons. (I believe these objects get created routinely as part of backtracking).\r\n\r\nI am also a bit suspicious of the way the original asymetry between the parse and unparse case:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef toParseError = new ParseError(schemaContext, dataContext, Maybe(this), maybeFormatString, args: _*)\r\n\r\ndef toUnparseError = new UnparseError(schemaContext, dataContext, maybeCause, maybeFormatString, args: _*)\r\n``` \r\n\r\nSince you are not allowed to have both maybeCause and maybeFormatString, I didn't see how the parse case could ever be correct, so I just copied the unparse case. (In particular, a caller may never pass maybeFormatString to ProcessingError if it would ever be converted to a ParseError, and I suspect that calling _.toParseError.toParseError will behave silly in that the error will be nested an additional time for each call.)\r\n\r\nLooking at the code, it seems the info being lost by not including \"this\" as the cause is the modeName arguement passed to the outer ProcessingError (\"Expression Evaluation\" in this case). Unfortunately, ParseError makes a point of being a \"Parse\" error which, by definition, overwrites the value of modeName with \"Parse\".\r\n\r\nMaybe it makes sense for modeName to be some sort of list? so the generated error looks more like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nParse Error: Expression Evaluation Error: Cannot convert 'not an int!' from String type to Long (Cannot convert to type long: For input string: \"not an int!\").\r\n```\r\n\r\n(The repetition of \"Error\" is independent, but probably a good idea from the perspective of string matching).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/474395380/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/478606977","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/203#issuecomment-478606977","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/203","id":478606977,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3ODYwNjk3Nw==","user":{"login":"jadams-tresys","id":30659277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjU5Mjc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30659277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadams-tresys","html_url":"https://github.com/jadams-tresys","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadams-tresys/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadams-tresys/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadams-tresys/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadams-tresys/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadams-tresys/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadams-tresys/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadams-tresys/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadams-tresys/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadams-tresys/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-01T14:39:49Z","updated_at":"2019-04-01T14:39:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This

People trying to remove these deprecated functions can turn it back on during development to find the uses of deprecated functions.\r\n3. Just don't deprecate those functions at all and just work to eventually remove them. We can make sure during reviews that new code added doesn't use them.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/500444559/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/502219324","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/228#issuecomment-502219324","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/228","id":502219324,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMjIxOTMyNA==","user":{"login":"mbeckerle","id":1524099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1524099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle","html_url":"https://github.com/mbeckerle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-14T18:37:32Z","updated_at":"2019-06-14T18:37:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"One must turn off both deprecation warnings and Xfatal-warnings to successfully compile.

This particular invariant is that any sequence, even just the one implied when a choice has an array element child, can be asked for its format annotation object, and one is positively returned, even if it's an empty one containing no annotations. \r\n\r\nThe separators of an enclosing sequence do not appear around array element occurrences for a choice branch that is an array element. To achieve that you need an explicit sequence surrounding the array element so you can express the separator. \r\n\r\nThe rationale here is that choices don't get to express separator properties, but that's where they would have to appear if the choice branch (that is an array element) was to have separators. \r\n\r\nI suppose the alternative would be to say choices are transparent to separation by an enclosing sequence. But that's not true if the choice expresses initiator/terminator, which choices are allowed to have.  I lost this battle long ago in the DFDL Workgroup. My position was only sequences should have delimiters of any kind, period, but this did not win the day, as other existing format description systems including some based on XSD, allowed these sorts of properties to be expressed on a variety of constructs.
