That meant none could proceed as they waited for an asynchronous task queued up, but with no threads available. This was surprising to have hit outside of a stress test given the available buffer slack, but it happened to a user.\n\nIt was an easy fix and also improved eviction throughput (2.5M/s => 4M/s). I don't think you'd hit this bug given your usage patterns, though.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/226328106/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/226339906","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/1679#issuecomment-226339906","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1679","id":226339906,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNjMzOTkwNg==","user":{"login":"fjy","id":428325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODMyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy","html_url":"https://github.com/fjy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-15T22:33:33Z","updated_at":"2016-06-15T22:33:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@pjain1

@dclim for writing this up. Looks great. Some thoughts,\n1. A custom runner sounds good, I would probably prefer writing to Kafka rather than Tranquility Server though (that way it can go to wherever ‚Äì¬†Druid or S3 or what have you)\n2. I agree that we probably don't need to look at percentiles\n3. For the baselines, is the idea that we would manually run a job to generate the baseline file? If so, that sounds good. The one thing I would want to make sure of here is that it's difficult to accidentally upload a wonky baseline file. Maybe it'd be enough to generate the new file and let the person running the test decide if it's OK to upload.\n4. For deciding if a test passed or failed, are you thinking of the test being a threshold % (10% difference = fail) or some other thing?\n5. Results that are \"too good\" should fail too, I think. This will help ensure that we remember to update the baseline when we optimize something, and thereby prevent performance from regressing after an optimization.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/226353542/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/226361501","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/2524#issuecomment-226361501","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2524","id":226361501,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNjM2MTUwMQ==","user":{"login":"b-slim","id":7376396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNzYzOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7376396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim","html_url":"https://github.com/b-slim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-16T00:55:34Z","updated_at":"2016-06-16T00:55:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Same opinion as @drcrallen  the feature needs more discussion, plus major changes to be compatible with new lookups impls.

The issue is that disabling a datasource with a running task doesn't actually disable the datasource so issuing a kill task on the interval doesn't work.  Even if it did, after issuing a kill task, it seemed like writing to an interval that had a completed task containing that interval does not work.\n\nAs a workaround for this, I can use the overlord API to shutdown the running task, disable the datasource, and issue a kill task for the data I've written. The issue with this is noted above, I can't write to an interval that is contained in a completed task. The message drops and the log has message that says something like `Turns out we decided not to actually make beams for identifier[druid:overlord/datasource_name] timestamp[2016-06-14T19:00:00.000Z]. Returning None.` I don't really consider this behavior problematic since I doubt there is a good use-case for killing a running task and then trying to write to the same interval; but, maybe the more appropriate solution would be changing this behavior.\n\nBy changing the granularity to seconds, I can shutdown the running task, issue a kill task for the data I've written, and, as long as my next write is in the next second, I can avoid the above issue. The reason I thought I should be able to use a second is because it is defined here: https://github.com/metamx/java-util/blob/master/src/main/java/com/metamx/common/Granularity.java#L43 but I see now this is a common class so it is probably getting used somewhere else where second is anticipated.\n\nI also see that this issue should have really been opened in the Tranquility repo, sorry about that. I've started working on adding second to the list and have tests passing, I am about to build a .jar and see if adding that definition allows me to run tests the way I was planning. Assuming it does, I was planning on opening a PR on the Tranquility repo. I can definitely run my projects tests in an alternate way, I was just trying to match how we run them for other data stores.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/226569294/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/226589432","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/3156#issuecomment-226589432","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3156","id":226589432,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNjU4OTQzMg==","user":{"login":"andremleblanc","id":5190468,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxOTA0Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5190468?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andremleblanc","html_url":"https://github.com/andremleblanc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andremleblanc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andremleblanc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andremleblanc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andremleblanc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andremleblanc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andremleblanc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andremleblanc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andremleblanc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andremleblanc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-16T19:32:29Z","updated_at":"2016-06-16T19:36:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I was able to make the change, build the .jar, and add it to my project.

I feel we should better separate those concepts to make things a bit clearer.\n\nHere's the way I see things:\n- _compression format_ is just a way to compress a block of arbitrary bytes to shrink storage requirements, and allow more data to be memory mapped. Currently we support three of those compression formats: lzf, lz4, and uncompressed. Just to clarify, \"uncompressed\" never meant the data was laid out as a continuous set of floats / longs, it just meant each block of bytes was store as is. I don't think many people should use it in practice, it was just added for completeness as a 'reference' compression format.\n- _data encoding scheme_ on the other hand refers to the byte representation we choose for the column values. This can be delta-encoding, variable-length encoding, or other fancy ways of reducing the number of bytes we store for each value.\n- _column layout_ finally is how we arrange all those values on disk / in memory. If we want to enable compression, we require some form of block layout. How values are represented in each block however, is up to the encoding scheme. If we don't require a block format, we can just store values as is, sequentially. All we need at the end of the day, is a way to translate a column index into, a direct position in the column, or into a block number and position in the block. \n\nIf we separate those concepts, than we could support things such as \"delta-encoding + lz4\" or \"variable-length + lz4\", or choose not to enable compression and store values as is.\n\nIf we believe there is value is doing so, we should consider separating those concepts now, to avoid too much backwards compatibility baggage down the road.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/226609738/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/226625724","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/3147#issuecomment-226625724","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3147","id":226625724,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNjYyNTcyNA==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-16T21:56:51Z","updated_at":"2016-06-16T21:58:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@xvrl so in your terminology, basically \"encoding\" is something like \"as-is\", \"RLE\", \"delta\", \"table\", \"variableLength\" (some are random-access and some are not); and \"compression\" is something like \"lz4\" or \"lzf\"?\n\nI think that split makes sense, with some caveats around minimizing copies,\n1. Encodings should never be forced to materialize decoded values. Some of them support random access (like \"as-is\", \"table\", \"delta\") and should be doable as reads directly out of a buffer. Some don't support random access (RLE/variableLength) but should still be doable as reads directly out of a buffer, ideally seeking to some checkpoint and then reading from there.\n2. The implementation of non-random-access encodings should be able to optimize for in-order access by remembering things like current-buffer-position and RLE state.\n3. It's important that \"none\" / \"uncompressed\" compression does not incur performance overhead; currently it does, since it copies into a decompression buffer anyway.\n\n#3148 achieves (1) and (3) although not in a way that allows composing compressions and encodings. For the \"skipping\" benchmarks in #3148 there are serious performance gains, seemingly mostly from avoiding unnecessary copies.\n\nWould it work if \"compression\" and \"encoding\" are different things, with capabilities like,\n- Decompressors should be passed a decompression buffer and are just responsible for decompressing blocks. The existing CompressedObjectStrategy should work fine for this, except probably \"uncompressed\" needs to be special cased in the serdes (so they don't create a decompression buffer nor use a CompressedObjectStrategy for that)\n- Decodings should be passed an already decompressed buffer (could be the original mmapped column if no compression is used; or a decompression buffer) and a row offset into the buffer that they should be decoding. Fixed length decodings would random access (read from `sizePerEntry * offset`) and variable length decodings would read from the beginning until they found the target row offset. They should be able to optimize for in-order access by remembering things like current-buffer-position and RLE state, and re-using that across multiple \"get\" calls if the buffer is the same.\n\nI could see that being useful for stuff like \"lz4 + delta\" which might end up better than just lz4 by itself for people trying to optimize for storage space.

It compress a block of arbitrary bytes to another block of bytes, which must be used by decompressing the block back into the original block.\n\nBy separating the concepts, the compression procedure should be \n- choose a _column layout_ to decide on how values are arranged\n- choose a _data encoding scheme_ to have a byte representation of each block of values\n- choose a _CompressionStrategy_ to compress the byte representation of each block\n\nThe problem I see with this is that these concepts are not entirely unrelated. Compression strategy such as LZ4 is essentially a data encoding scheme, as it belongs to LZ77 scheme which is kinda like an advanced version of Run Length Encoding. I believe both _data encoding scheme_ and _CompressionStrategy_ have the same objective of writing objects into bytes that can later be decoded, and they should be considered as the same concept. I've done LZ4 compression on variable length encoded longs, and the resulting file size isn't much different from normal LZ4 compression. This is the case since variable length encoding already eliminated large amount of repetition of 0, so LZ4 compression would not be as effective.\n\nBy combining these concepts, the process would then be\n- choose a _column layout_ to decide on how values are arranged\n- write the bytes of each block with a  _data encoding scheme_ or _compressionStrategy_\n\nNow encoding such as table and delta allow random access in the compressed form, which means they don't need to decompress the entire block to read a value. This makes it possible for _column layout_ to compress the entire column together without dividing into blocks. Note compressing the entire column is not possible for non random access compression method such as LZ4 and RLE, since they need to uncompress the entire block. This means only certain combinations are available, and I've named these combinations as _CompressionFormat_ in #3148.\n\nBasically the compression formats are\n- LZ4/LZF/Uncompressed = block layout + LZ4/LZF/Uncompressed\n- Table/Delta = entire layout + Table/Delta\n- Uncompressed_new = entire layout + Uncompressed\n\nWithin these, Uncompressed and LZF formats should be deprecated, as they're worse version of Uncompressed_new and LZ4\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/226632300/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/226633663","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/3147#issuecomment-226633663","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3147","id":226633663,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNjYzMzY2Mw==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-16T22:35:31Z","updated_at":"2016-06-16T22:36:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@acslk Did you see if there is any benefit to combining lz4 + delta (or lz4 + rle or lz4 + some other encoding)?

I agree the distinction between encoding and compression can be fuzzy. I would say this: encoding relies on the type of data being encoded, and defines how we translate a series of values/objects into bytes. Compression is something that's agnostic to the underlying data and operates on opaque bytes. So I think your suggestion to have decompressors and decoders goes in line with what I suggested. We should obviously avoid copying data if there is no need for intermediate de-coding / de-compression buffers.\n\n@acslk If I'm reading your results correctly, based on the numbers in the corresponding PR, it looks like bytesLong delta + lz4 is 50% of the size of bytesLong delta alone, and reqInt delta + lz4 is 10% of the size of reqInt delta? Sounds like there's some significant benefit to combining delta encoding + compression.\n\nWe should also keep in mind that raw speed alone is not the only factor going into choosing a format. With smaller data sizes we can memory map a lot more data, which means that compression can give you much better overall performance for a given hardware configuration than uncompressed data. The additional CPU time required will typically be orders of magnitude smaller than the time it takes to page in additional data from SSDs. Ultimately the user will have to decide what gives them the best performance / price-point trade-off.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/226825123/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/226828023","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/3147#issuecomment-226828023","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3147","id":226828023,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNjgyODAyMw==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-17T17:16:47Z","updated_at":"2016-06-17T17:16:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@xvrl I imagine that people who intend to have all of a particular dataset in-memory and want high performance will prefer to use delta/table by itself and not combine with lz4; for this set of needs, the 10‚Äì50% size increase is totally worth it for the speedups. The skipping benchmarks show multiple order of magnitude speed improvement in filtered queries from avoiding lz4 (mostly due to not needing to decompress an entire block to read just one row). Even unfiltered queries still show a 2.5x speed improvement. So I don't think combining lz4 + delta would be useful for this set of needs.\n\nPeople who intend to page a lot from SSDs will probably prefer smaller data sizes and should still be willing to take the CPU hit of lz4.
