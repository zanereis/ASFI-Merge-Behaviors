So the remoteUrl in ClusterUtils.mergeUrl method is empty. So it doesn't have group and version key.\r\n> \r\n> If we don't use direct invoke, and either group or version of ReferenceConfig and ServiceConfig is different, it will not go into the ClusterUtils.merge method.\r\n> \r\n> Maybe we can split the ClusterUtils.merge method into two methods, one is used by direct invoke. The other is used by the indirect invoke.\r\n\r\nI read the code ZookeeperRegistry.toUrlsWithEmpty, I found \r\n- if the ”group“ or” version“ is mismatching，the url will not be passed to next process.\r\n- so when invoke the RegistryDirectory.toInvokers, the group or version is always equel between ReferenceConfig and ServiceConfig.\r\n- then the method \"ClusterUtils.merge()\" merge the provider's \"gourp\" or \"version\" value and consumer's \"gourp\" or \"version\" value  is redundant.\r\n\r\nSo I think , when provider does not have \"group\" or \"version\" (generally direct invoke) ，then do not remove \"group\" or \"version\" key from local map，it can meet both direct invoke and from registry.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/520163870/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/520173331","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/4779#issuecomment-520173331","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4779","id":520173331,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMDE3MzMzMQ==","user":{"login":"tswstarplanet","id":3047563,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDc1NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3047563?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet","html_url":"https://github.com/tswstarplanet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-10T19:20:18Z","updated_at":"2019-08-10T19:20:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@WhaleCloud-platform
