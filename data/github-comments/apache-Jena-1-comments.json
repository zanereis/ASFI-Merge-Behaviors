So if\nyou, outside Jena, wants to use transitiveReasoner, you need to also\nhave those other Jena packages.\n\nNow, half of these packages might not need to be exported at all - the\nplugin just ignores those that are called .impl -- but I don't know\nenough about the structure to know which other packages in Jena can be\nbarred from exported (e.g. implementation only packages).\n\nWhich imports were not satisfied?

(The main JIRA item blocking Fuseki2 going from \"beta\" designation to 2.0.0 has been fixed.)\n\nSome discussion point for this after using it for a while:\n- I like \"raw response\" and the ability to download is great - would it be possible to have choice of content type? Sometimes, what the developer needs to work with is fixed by other parts of the toolset.\n- As a development admin tool, I wonder if being more explicit about RDF terms in the results table: e.g. `_:` to indicate bNodes, `\"\"` on strings, `<>` for URIs.  This is a style matter; as a debugging aid, bringing out the kind of term might be useful.\n- Is it possible to have a variable width results table?\n- When looking at it in the context of the Fuseki2 UI, there are differnces of style and approach. The iconograph is black whereas the rest of the Fuseki2 UI is coloured with text.  In context, the execute button looks like a \"go right\" arrow.  Is this configurable?\n\nIn an ideal world, both the current display and this improved one woudl be in the code base. It is insurance for the future development of either (as a project, we think in terms of stability over years).  How hard would that be (sorry - Im not a strong javascript/UI developer)? Not as a user choice, but as a relative simple (documented in the code, not the website) way to switch.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/67202280/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/67207120","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/11#issuecomment-67207120","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/11","id":67207120,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3MjA3MTIw","user":{"login":"LaurensRietveld","id":988347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4ODM0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/988347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurensRietveld","html_url":"https://github.com/LaurensRietveld","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurensRietveld/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurensRietveld/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurensRietveld/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurensRietveld/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurensRietveld/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurensRietveld/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurensRietveld/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurensRietveld/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurensRietveld/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-16T18:28:36Z","updated_at":"2014-12-16T18:28:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"- About the content types:\n  To be able to download different raw response content type, we'd need to set the content type of YASQE dynamically. This is pretty easy to do: we can just add a dropdown menu with some content types. Selecting a content type from the dropdown menu (and executing the query again), will show the proper results. \n  An alternative would be to use the new YASGUI version (see http://beta.yasgui.org), a client-side lib as well, which supports modifying request parameters. But: this is pretty beta though, so if you're keen on using that one, I'd postpone this until it is a bit more stable.\n- About explicit RDF terms: This is pretty easy. I'll add that\n- About the variable width: The table plugin (which uses the datatables library) tries to automatically determine the 'best' dimensions. There might be a plugin which allows the user to resize the columns though (http://www.bacubacu.com/colresizable/). I'll check whether that one works nice with the datatables lib.\n- I could easily simply make a backup of the old Not sure about how to approach this, but I understand your point. I'll check it out.\n\nps. The new YASR version (http://yasr.yasgui.org) has some new outputs: a pivot table, and google charts. There are some considerations to keep in mind though:\n- the size of the fuseki UI dependencies will increase as well. Particularly when you want to include the D3js pivot plugin (used for a treemap), or when you'd like to include google charts\n- The google charts is impossible to package. These charts are drawn by fetching some JS files from the internet. I.e., this is an external dependency, which does not work when fuseki is running on localhost and offline.\n\nCould you let me know whether you'd like to include these two new plugins, and if so, whether you'd like to include D3 and/or google charts as well\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/67207120/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/67244415","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/11#issuecomment-67244415","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/11","id":67244415,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3MjQ0NDE1","user":{"login":"LaurensRietveld","id":988347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4ODM0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/988347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurensRietveld","html_url":"https://github.com/LaurensRietveld","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurensRietveld/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurensRietveld/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurensRietveld/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurensRietveld/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurensRietveld/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurensRietveld/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurensRietveld/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurensRietveld/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurensRietveld/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-16T22:26:36Z","updated_at":"2014-12-16T22:28:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I updated the PR (force-update).

Is this not an\nissue also for apache-jena/NOTICE and LICENSE which I believe are also\nmanually made?\n\nAre there any other outstanding issues with apache-jena-osgi now on master?\nI don't see any errors with mvn verify using OpenJDK8 and OpenJDK7 on\nUbuntu 14.10/x64 and Apache Maven 3.2.1.\n\n## [INFO]\n\n[INFO] Reactor Summary:\n[INFO]\n[INFO] Apache Jena - OSGi ................................

for pointing out [CacheLRU](https://github.com/apache/jena/blob/master/jena-arq/src/main/java/org/apache/jena/atlas/lib/cache/CacheLRU.java) which I missed.\n\nI have now looked into this, and moving CacheLRU would mean also moving its interface [Cache](https://github.com/apache/jena/blob/master/jena-arq/src/main/java/org/apache/jena/atlas/lib/Cache.java),  `ActionKeyValue` and `CacheImpl`.\n\nIf these go into a new package, e.g. `org.apache.jena.lib.cache`, then for theit is easy to make `@deprecated` subclasses/subinterfaces for `Cache`, `CacheLRU` and even `CacheImpl`. It is trickier for `ActionKeyValue` which is more wide-spread in use within Atlas - unless I do some kind of proxy.\n\nSo that hints to me that I would have to rather let them stay in the same package, but live in `jena-core`. This would work -- but it would either make a nasty split of that package across two Maven modules -- or the whole of `atlas.lib.*` moves over.\n\nMoving/fixing/etc CacheLRU is sounding more and more like something to reorganize in Jena 3 - Can we have a Fix for Version 3.0 in Jira that we can put something like this against?\n\nNow simply adding the Guava dependency sounds like a much easier path!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/84168113/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/84168717","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/44#issuecomment-84168717","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/44","id":84168717,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0MTY4NzE3","user":{"login":"stain","id":253413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzQxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/253413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stain","html_url":"https://github.com/stain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stain/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-20T22:20:15Z","updated_at":"2015-03-20T22:20:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Pull Request now no longer includes the java-sizeof test dependency - I would suggest go ahead to merge it until we don't get in the guava patch.
