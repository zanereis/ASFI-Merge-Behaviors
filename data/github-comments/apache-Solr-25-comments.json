When I run a [stress](https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine/blob/master/caffeine/src/test/java/com/github/benmanes/caffeine/cache/Stresser.java) and [Lincheck](https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine/blob/master/caffeine/src/test/java/com/github/benmanes/caffeine/lincheck/AbstractLincheckCacheTest.java) tests it is fine, but these can be tricky. The `put` is optimized as a retry look instead of a pessimistic compute (2x faster), but in a microbenchmark so likely not important in an actual workload and correctness is more important.\r\n\r\nIt looks like `asMap().compute` is the correct replacement as `Cache.get` is the same as `Map.computeIfAbsent` and this inserts or replaces an existing value.

I'd rewrite that infinite loop to something more \"CAS\" like.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the challenge with this method is that `ConcurrentHashMap` is pessimistic in its write operations by locking before searching for the entry in the hash bin (or segment in 5-7). Doug had [concerns](https://markmail.org/message/dixewqcvbbs5gzi2) about a full prescreen due to interactions with biased locking, safepoints, and GC pressure. He did eventually add a partial prescreen for the head of the bin, but that cannot be relied upon as the table is designed to prefer a high collision rate (cheap/poor hash offset by red-black tree bins).\r\n\r\nCAS-style would be a [putIfAbsent loop](https://github.com/ben-manes/concurrentlinkedhashmap/blob/cc3e11603e8a91185c1748633be2c703e218219e/src/main/java/com/googlecode/concurrentlinkedhashmap/ConcurrentLinkedHashMap.java#L716-L750), so it would lock even if unsuccessful. In that case then the loop could be removed as locking is the costly work, so a [compute](https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine/blob/c5cc2d4f04a317111705108a06b7babe3ce9dc6f/caffeine/src/main/java/com/github/benmanes/caffeine/cache/BoundedLocalCache.java#L1609-L1701) would be preferable. Some users have assumed that `putIfAbsent` is a cheap read if present (e.g. https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/2797), so the cache tries to read and fallback to locking only when appropriate.\r\n\r\nYou can think of this as a [TTAS loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_and_test-and-set) which has a similar speedup in comparison to the more straightforward TAS approach.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1289828195/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1289855920","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1039#issuecomment-1289855920","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1039","id":1289855920,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5M4aOw","user":{"login":"risdenk","id":3384157,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzODQxNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3384157?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk","html_url":"https://github.com/risdenk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-25T01:26:27Z","updated_at":"2022-10-25T01:26:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"part 3 continues here: https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1116","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1289855920/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1290126484","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1118#issuecomment-1290126484","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1118","id":1290126484,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5M5cSU","user":{"login":"uschindler","id":1005388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDUzODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1005388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uschindler","html_url":"https://github.com/uschindler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uschindler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uschindler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uschindler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uschindler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uschindler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uschindler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uschindler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uschindler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uschindler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-25T07:41:38Z","updated_at":"2022-10-25T07:41:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi Ben,\r\nthanks for the insight. My comment was not directly about the type of loop (CAS, TTAS,...) it was more about the coding style. Hotspot sometimes tries to optimize loops where it thinks it has some common pattern. My proposal would be to mabye form the loop in a way that it follows a common pattern (like mentioned CAS, or use a while with condition up-front,...). This one is a `for(;;)` with very strange exit conditions and I had the feeling it causes some bugs in hotspot and maybe also triggers the infinite loop. In Lucene's bug we had some similar problems where loop invariants were incorrectly guessed.\r\n\r\nOf course if this is a bug in your code leading to the infinite loop, then it is not a hotspot problem.

if the starting point for the stream is a Map<>, the 'merge keys' part where it checks for collisions(a, b) -> IllegalStateException would never be possible\r\n\r\nIn this case, I think that's true - we're not really \"mapping\" the keys in the sense this method allows, we're just taking them unmodified from an existing Map.  I can imagine cases where the merge/collection function would be necessary, but it looks redundant here to me 🤷 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1291967379/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1292023634","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1130#issuecomment-1292023634","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1130","id":1292023634,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5NArdS","user":{"login":"epugh","id":22395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh","html_url":"https://github.com/epugh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-26T13:19:22Z","updated_at":"2022-10-26T13:19:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I like the freshened up text!

The `ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_signingPassword` variable which is used to pass the password for the gradle signing method (from `buildAndPushRelease.py`) only works with the [`useInMemoryPgpKeys` function](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/signing_plugin.html#sec:in-memory-keys) which we don't use. This means that the only way the python script could pass the passphrase to gradle is via a `-P` which isn't great.
