@kimmking @ieu I have tested this SQL on the master branch and got the same exception. The reason for the error is that we do not have a good support for the function expression in the `VALUES` ​​clause of the `INSERT` statement.\r\n\r\nTaking the SQL——`INSERT post(title, extra) VALUES (?, JSON_OBJECT(contact, ?))` as an example, the parameters in the values ​​clause will be parsed into  `ParameterMarkerExpressionSegment` and `ExpressionProjectionSegment`.\r\n\r\nWhen initializing `InsertValueContext`, only the parameters in `ParameterMarkerExpressionSegment` can calculate parameterCount normally, which leads to the loss of parameters in `ExpressionProjectionSegment`.\r\n\r\nMySQLStatementVisitor.java\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Override\r\npublic final ASTNode visitRegularFunction(final RegularFunctionContext ctx) {\r\n    if (null != ctx.completeRegularFunction()) {\r\n        calculateParameterCount(ctx.completeRegularFunction().expr());\r\n    }\r\n    String text = ctx.start.getInputStream().getText(new Interval(ctx.start.getStartIndex(), ctx.stop.getStopIndex()));\r\n    return new ExpressionProjectionSegment(ctx.getStart().getStartIndex(), ctx.getStop().getStopIndex(), text);\r\n}\r\n\r\n// TODO :FIXME, sql case id: insert_with_str_to_date\r\nprivate void calculateParameterCount(final Collection<ExprContext> exprContexts) {\r\n    for (ExprContext each : exprContexts) {\r\n        visit(each);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nInsertValueContext.java\r\n```java\r\nprivate int calculateParameterCount(final Collection<ExpressionSegment> assignments) {\r\n    int result = 0;\r\n    for (ExpressionSegment each : assignments) {\r\n        if (each instanceof ParameterMarkerExpressionSegment) {\r\n            result++;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    return result;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn order to solve this exception, I think that the sub-expression in the function expression should be parsed in the `MySQL Statement SQLVisitor` class, and the changes are as follows:\r\n\r\nFirst, add the `subExpressions` parameter in the `ExpressionProjectionSegment` class.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n/**\r\n * Expression projection segment.\r\n */\r\n@Getter\r\npublic final class ExpressionProjectionSegment implements ProjectionSegment, ComplexExpressionSegment, AliasAvailable {\r\n    \r\n    private final int startIndex;\r\n    \r\n    private final int stopIndex;\r\n    \r\n    private final String text;\r\n    \r\n    private final Collection<ExpressionSegment> subExpressions = new LinkedList<>();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSecond, modify the visitor parsing processing logic:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Override\r\npublic final ASTNode visitRegularFunction(final RegularFunctionContext ctx) {\r\n    String text = ctx.start.getInputStream().getText(new Interval(ctx.start.getStartIndex(), ctx.stop.getStopIndex()));\r\n    ExpressionProjectionSegment result = new ExpressionProjectionSegment(ctx.getStart().getStartIndex(), ctx.getStop().getStopIndex(), text);\r\n    if (null != ctx.completeRegularFunction()) {\r\n        result.getSubExpressions().addAll(calculateParameterCount(ctx.completeRegularFunction().expr()));\r\n    }\r\n    return result;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// TODO :FIXME, sql case id: insert_with_str_to_date\r\nprivate Collection<ExpressionSegment> calculateParameterCount(final Collection<ExprContext> exprContexts) {\r\n    CollectionValue<ExpressionSegment> result = new CollectionValue<>();\r\n    for (ExprContext each : exprContexts) {\r\n        result.getValue().add((ExpressionSegment) visit(each));\r\n    }\r\n    return result.getValue();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, adjust the `parameterCount` calculation logic in `InsertValueContext` class:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nprivate int calculateParameterCount(final Collection<ExpressionSegment> assignments) {\r\n    int result = 0;\r\n    for (ExpressionSegment each : assignments) {\r\n        if (each instanceof ParameterMarkerExpressionSegment) {\r\n            result++;\r\n        }\r\n        if (each instanceof ExpressionProjectionSegment) {\r\n            result += calculateParameterCount(((ExpressionProjectionSegment) each).getSubExpressions());\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    return result;\r\n}\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/721219274/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/721233969","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/8003#issuecomment-721233969","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/8003","id":721233969,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyMTIzMzk2OQ==","user":{"login":"strongduanmu","id":10829171,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODI5MTcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10829171?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/strongduanmu","html_url":"https://github.com/strongduanmu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strongduanmu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strongduanmu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strongduanmu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strongduanmu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strongduanmu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strongduanmu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strongduanmu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strongduanmu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strongduanmu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-03T16:25:15Z","updated_at":"2020-11-03T16:25:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@terrymanu I think the first way is more convenient to use, and there is no need to worry about calls between different statements. In the second way, we may design a reasonable structure at the beginning to facilitate the reuse of code blocks.

However I am unsure whether we need a new `ExpressionProjectionSegment` containing `Collection<ExpressionSegment>` or add `Collection<ExpressionSegment>` to the existing `ExpressionProjectionSegment`.\r\n\r\nFor me I prefer a new expressionSegment since `String text` and `subExpressions` could not have a particular value meanwhile. It also looks like the existing `ExpressionProjectionSegment` has no special follow-up handling and just to store the complex parsing content in `text` member.\r\n\r\nAs @jingshanglu did substantial work on `expression parsing`, let us listen to what he thinks about this one. :)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/721556550/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/721557471","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/7905#issuecomment-721557471","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/7905","id":721557471,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyMTU1NzQ3MQ==","user":{"login":"avalon5666","id":64016692,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MDE2Njky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64016692?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/avalon5666","html_url":"https://github.com/avalon5666","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avalon5666/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avalon5666/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avalon5666/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avalon5666/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avalon5666/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avalon5666/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avalon5666/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avalon5666/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avalon5666/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-04T07:18:36Z","updated_at":"2020-11-04T07:18:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Did you have a custom BeanPostProcessor?

IMO, DONT UPDATE Sharding key SHOULD be a principle in SharidngSphere instead of an implicit configuration to point it.\r\n\r\nAgreed. The uses cases for updating sharding keys are rare and probably should reconsider the sharding strategy if it did happen. However, to be clear, this question is not asking for providing capability of updating sharding keys like #8006 . The title of the issue can be misleading. \r\n\r\nThis issue is about correctly interpreting JPA generated update sqls as sharding key is included in set clause with value unchanged, thus causing misunderstanding from sharding sphere that sharding key is being updated. It's not.\r\n\r\nI just wanted to clarify in case anyone was misled by the title.
