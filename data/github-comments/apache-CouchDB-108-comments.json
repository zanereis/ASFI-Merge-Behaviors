However, his would undo the [work](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/commit/aaa3921cb1cc1c96052630ac8a53ec2471e638d8) to make the JS code compatible with v8, or other JS engines, and would make it SpiderMonkey only code. I think in case of that commit we did actually have Cloudant's ateles engine as an alternative working JS engine. But, still, even for 3.x, I think it would be nice to maintain the compatibility with other engines at least for the future. So, perhaps we can `enableToSource` but also keep the `obj.toString() | err.stack` logic since it's already there?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/1104002432/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/1104330144","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/4001#issuecomment-1104330144","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/4001","id":1104330144,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmUc5B0r2g","user":{"login":"rnewson","id":47223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson","html_url":"https://github.com/rnewson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-20T18:43:20Z","updated_at":"2022-04-20T18:43:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"hi, we're fixing a security issue here so if at all possible please try to get 3.2.2 installed. you need to specify a value for couchdb/cookie.

That would leave data in the socket and mess up the subsequent client request if they are re-using HTTP connections. Perhaps we should try to flush the data (up to some timeout / size) in order to help out with connection logic/reuse.

My python packages broke for some reason and I get some weird `decode` error coming from couchdb python library.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/1115509189/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/1117748528","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/3948#issuecomment-1117748528","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/3948","id":1117748528,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmUc5Cn30w","user":{"login":"nickva","id":211822,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTgyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/211822?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva","html_url":"https://github.com/nickva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-04T19:33:23Z","updated_at":"2022-05-04T19:33:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This was fixed.

if replications are set up, and a particular document is updated, thenthe  replicator will attempt to replicate all the missing revisions from the source to the target. So, for instance, if revision `{\"_id\":\"doc1\", \"_rev\":\"2-def\"} is purged from the target, but not the source, then when \"doc1\" gets updated on the source with {\"_id\":\"doc1\", \"_rev\":\"3-xyz\"}, then both \"2-def\" and \"3-xyz\" will be replicated to the target.\r\n\r\nIt's a bit tricky to purge them, currently. There is no ability to replicate purges and the replicator wants to replicate everything, as that's its main job. You could try purging those via a scheduled task or try to somehow minimize generation of conflicts to start with. Setting a low (25) revs_limit might contribute to it somewhat. I am thinking of cases where a document might receive more than 25 updates in row before it gets a chance to be replicated, so some revisions might be pruned already (the root might look like \"26-jkl\") and it might result in conflicts being generated during replication.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we (CouchDB) would come up with a few more replication options, such as, for example:\r\n  * skip_deleted = true (To skip deleted revision branches, to allow users to filter out tombstones)\r\n  * winning_revs_only = true (To replicated only winning revisions)\r\n \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/1137765688/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/1138135594","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/4034#issuecomment-1138135594","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/4034","id":1138135594,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmUc5D1pIq","user":{"login":"tudordumitriu","id":4671554,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NzE1NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4671554?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tudordumitriu","html_url":"https://github.com/tudordumitriu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tudordumitriu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tudordumitriu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tudordumitriu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tudordumitriu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tudordumitriu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tudordumitriu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tudordumitriu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tudordumitriu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tudordumitriu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-26T04:16:09Z","updated_at":"2022-05-26T04:16:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks @nickva \r\nThese options would be very useful in my opinion and would help a lot, so if you will plan to add them we'll be the first to enable them.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/1138135594/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/1138161534","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/4040#issuecomment-1138161534","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/4040","id":1138161534,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmUc5D1vd-","user":{"login":"nickva","id":211822,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTgyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/211822?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva","html_url":"https://github.com/nickva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-26T05:14:17Z","updated_at":"2022-05-26T05:14:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> I'm curious what generates {shutdown, Err} [here](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/4040/files#diff-a8cd08c496b1621f5f9ddeb3bf001005c1ebaf7db81432fde01f7624a35ea8dcR1137)?\r\n\r\nThere it might be when the mochiweb process crashes, but then we could catch it log the error, then call `exit(shutdown)`.

Also, does this mean that the indexing process would be radically faster than it is now if a JS engine is directly linked into the Erlang VM? \r\n\r\nI am a happy couchdb user, the only worry I have is about the duration of indexing at scale (for a database with billions of documents). I wonder if indexing will be able to catch up if 10s of millions of documents are added on a daily basis. I am also thinking about the scenarios when for some reasons an index must be built from scratch on such a large database. Because of the network overhead with the Query Server (if i understand correctly), I am worried that indexing may never converge. \r\n\r\nBoosting the performance of indexing and enabling the process to saturate bare metal would give users peace of mind when planning such large systems.
