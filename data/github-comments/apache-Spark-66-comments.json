This ends up adding the path of the jar without the \"local:\" prefix, which means the jar is expected to be in the distributed cache (as per the comment in SparkContext: \"In order for this to work in yarn-cluster mode the user must specify the --addjars option\").\n\nIf you add \"-addJars /home/tgraves/test2/tgravescs-spark/examples/target/scala-2.10/spark-examples_2.10-assembly-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar\" to your command line it works (well, it works for me), but it sort of defeats the purpose of using local: URIs. I had a modified SparkPi in my tree that hardcoded a local: URI for the addJar() argument, and that worked fine without needing to add the extra argument (and did not incur in extra copying of the jar around).\n\nI'm not sure there's an easy way to fix this (how can SparkPi know to add the jar with a local: URI without some kind of command line argument telling it to do so?), but it's caused by the client code (in this case, SparkPi), so I'm less concerned.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/39998654/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/40000538","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/370#issuecomment-40000538","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/370","id":40000538,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMDAwNTM4","user":{"login":"AmplabJenkins","id":4031291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzEyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4031291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/AmplabJenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-09T18:37:03Z","updated_at":"2014-04-09T18:37:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Merged build finished.

Encoding categoricals as continuous values invites, maybe unwittingly, invalid operations, like finding the distance between \"apple\" and \"orange\". Or trying to apply linear regression as a classifier. I suppose it also means there must be a translation layer, yes, in all cases.\n\nDecisionTreeModel makes it a little more concrete. I imagine it should have both the RegressionModel and ClassificationModel traits eventually? Both traits want a predict method that returns Double, OK. This gets a little dicier since it's not just a classifier method return Doubles-that-are-labels, but a single method that some other times returns Doubles-that-are-numbers.\n\nThe AUC-related PR raises a second point. How would you return a distribution over labels? That's a fairly sensible thing to do, esp. for things like random forests. A Double can't encode that, and at least has to be a bunch of (Double,Double) pairs or something. That PR proceeds by just making a second set of methods. In any event that kind of change also needs an API change, of a different kind.\n\nFrom the PMML angle -- you could note that the abstraction in PMML thinks of categoricals as a different type from numeric. If those models were to be supported there would have to be some translating layer on top, within MLlib, to emulate the abstraction at the same level. So then maybe that's a reason to just make it the MLlib's abstraction too?\n\nOK enough of all that, it's a big tangent. That's the argument I have for at least deferring setting this in stone.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/40027762/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/40027959","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/374#issuecomment-40027959","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/374","id":40027959,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMDI3OTU5","user":{"login":"AmplabJenkins","id":4031291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzEyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4031291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/AmplabJenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-09T23:17:23Z","updated_at":"2014-04-09T23:17:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":" Merged build triggered. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/40027959/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/40027967","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/374#issuecomment-40027967","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/374","id":40027967,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMDI3OTY3","user":{"login":"AmplabJenkins","id":4031291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzEyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4031291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/AmplabJenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-09T23:17:31Z","updated_at":"2014-04-09T23:17:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Merged build started. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/40027967/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/40028182","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/373#issuecomment-40028182","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/373","id":40028182,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMDI4MTgy","user":{"login":"AmplabJenkins","id":4031291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzEyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4031291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/AmplabJenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-09T23:21:17Z","updated_at":"2014-04-09T23:21:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Merged build finished.

for getting rid of the 100ms wait.\n\nI think this patch addresses SPARK-1407. Without this patch, even if sc.stop() is called, it will only close the logger and flush whatever is already in its write buffer. If, at this point, some events are yet to be drained from event queue, when listenerThread tries to post them to logger later on, the same Filesystem is closed exception will be encountered. Consequently event log file will be incomplete (same as in SPARK-1407). \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/40031940/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/40031981","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/369#issuecomment-40031981","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/369","id":40031981,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMDMxOTgx","user":{"login":"ash211","id":357170,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzE3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/357170?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ash211","html_url":"https://github.com/ash211","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ash211/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ash211/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ash211/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ash211/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ash211/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ash211/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ash211/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ash211/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ash211/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-10T00:30:45Z","updated_at":"2014-04-10T00:30:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"That gets me closer, but it looks like you then have to pass all the implicit parameters or none of them.
