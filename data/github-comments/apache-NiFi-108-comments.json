The good thing about the current code is that you have already created classes that encode requests and responses, e.g. IndexOperationRequest, IndexOperationResponse, which will make the change much easier.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, these could be the first step to using the REST client, and then the PutElasticsearchHTTP processor can eventually be phased out to use the low-level client, providing a more flexible processor.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-rest/current/java-rest-high-compatibility.html\r\nhttps://www.elastic.co/blog/state-of-the-official-elasticsearch-java-clients","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/468371024/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/468376692","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3335#issuecomment-468376692","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3335","id":468376692,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2ODM3NjY5Mg==","user":{"login":"moranr","id":14202495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjAyNDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14202495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/moranr","html_url":"https://github.com/moranr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moranr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moranr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moranr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moranr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moranr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moranr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moranr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moranr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moranr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-28T18:09:22Z","updated_at":"2019-02-28T18:09:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mcgilman thinking about that some more, snap-to-grid might be nice as the default behavior.

E.g. there is logic in nifi-cli around import which ensures the new PG is never overlapping existing ones and has some whitespace around it upon placement.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately there's no other way to make the snap alignment consistent between components of varying sizes.  I tested numerous values and settled on 8px increments, and then adjusted the width/height of components such that they divided evenly by 8px.  Values less than 8px weren't noticeable enough, and larger values would've required drastic changes to component width/height.   My goal was to implement this feature without overhauling the entire canvas, and I think that this was the best compromise.  \r\n\r\nThe entire point of the snap-to-grid functionality is to be able to align components quickly without disrupting the developer's workflow.  I'm aware of the 1.2.0 alignment functionality, but the UX is cumbersome.  Click+Drag to select all components -> right click -> choose alignment (horizontal/vertical).  Having to repeat this step every time you add a new component is often more cumbersome than it's worth.  \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/468847780/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/468894165","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3335#issuecomment-468894165","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3335","id":468894165,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2ODg5NDE2NQ==","user":{"login":"R-Bower","id":11933208,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTMzMjA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11933208?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/R-Bower","html_url":"https://github.com/R-Bower","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/R-Bower/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/R-Bower/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/R-Bower/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/R-Bower/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/R-Bower/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/R-Bower/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/R-Bower/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/R-Bower/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/R-Bower/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-02T07:07:26Z","updated_at":"2019-03-02T07:08:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Just pushed.  \r\n## Updates\r\n- The shift key now disables snap alignment when held during a drag event.  \r\n- Adjusted the `nf-remote-process-group` `text.remote-process-group-last-refresh` to account for the increased height of the component.\r\n- `nf-label` now resizes based on the snap alignment value.  \r\n- Reduced initial width/height of `nf-label` from 150 to 148.\r\n- Increased MIN_HEIGHT of `nf-label` from 20 to 24\r\n- Added snap alignment to the drag event for `nf-connection`.  \r\n- Increased width of `nf-connection` from 216 to 224.

You can easily align components as you drag/drop or move them on the canvas, creating straight connection lines w/o having to go through the context menu. It also lets you align along a single horizontal or vertical edge (e.g., align left, align top) which currently is not possible.

I reviewed and tested the PR, and wanted to discuss about the change a bit.\r\n\r\nAs a summary, here are the key points:\r\n1. The reported issue at StackOverflow has been addressed by other changes since NiFI 1.9.0.\r\n2. But the same flow doesn't work well with schema inference, conversion result has `null` elements.\r\n3. To fix no.2 (I assume), this PR modifies DataTypeUtils.isCompatibleDataType. However, I suggest fixing DataTypeUtils.toRecord method instead. DataTypeUtils.toRecord converts Java Map to MapRecord before isCompatibleDataType is called, but it doesn't do so recursively. https://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/master/nifi-commons/nifi-record/src/main/java/org/apache/nifi/serialization/record/util/DataTypeUtils.java#L302\r\n\r\nI may be wrong about above analysis.. How do you think?\r\n\r\nPlease refer followings for details.\r\n\r\n---\r\nDetails:\r\n\r\nI've tested the Stackoverflow questions flow with NiFi 1.8.0 and I got the reported exception:\r\n```\r\n2019-03-07 16:51:40,061 ERROR [Timer-Driven Process Thread-6] o.a.n.p.jolt.record.JoltTransformRecord JoltTransformRecord[id=72a28625-3c23-3bc6-73cd-c06d247bf8dc] Unable to write transformed records StandardFlowFileRecord[uuid=c8b59dad-ff78-4c49-898b-9ac6923eb94c,claim=StandardContentClaim [resourceClaim=StandardResourceClaim[id=1551945098069-1, container=default, section=1], offset=0, length=873],offset=0,name=c8b59dad-ff78-4c49-898b-9ac6923eb94c,size=873] due to org.apache.nifi.serialization.record.util.IllegalTypeConversionException: Cannot convert value of class [Ljava.lang.Object; because the type is not supported: org.apache.nifi.serialization.record.util.IllegalTypeConversionException: Cannot convert value of class [Ljava.lang.Object; because the type is not supported\r\norg.apache.nifi.serialization.record.util.IllegalTypeConversionException: Cannot convert value of class [Ljava.lang.Object; because the type is not supported\r\n        at org.apache.nifi.serialization.record.util.DataTypeUtils.convertRecordFieldtoObject(DataTypeUtils.java:460)\r\n        at org.apache.nifi.serialization.record.util.DataTypeUtils.convertRecordMapToJavaMap(DataTypeUtils.java:472)\r\n        at org.apache.nifi.serialization.record.util.DataTypeUtils.convertRecordFieldtoObject(DataTypeUtils.java:444)\r\n        at org.apache.nifi.processors.jolt.record.JoltTransformRecord.onTrigger(JoltTransformRecord.java:318)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, the flow works fine with NiFi 1.9.0 which has been released recently.\r\nSo, the reported issue at Stackoverflow has been fixed by different commit.\r\n\r\nFurther testing, I found that with NiFi 1.10.0 snapshot master branch, if I used schema inference, result becomes null like this:\r\nBefore applying this fix, conversion result was:\r\n```\r\n[{\"DataItems\":[null,null,null,null]}]\r\n```\r\nThis happened because the output data type was not found for the inferred Choice[Record, Record] was not compatible with the Java Map type. I assume that's why you fixed isCompatibleDataType method.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/master/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-standard-services/nifi-record-serialization-services-bundle/nifi-record-serialization-services/src/main/java/org/apache/nifi/json/WriteJsonResult.java#L284\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough I got the expected result with this fix even with schema inference, I think it's more appropriate to fix DataTypeUtils.toRecord method, instead of isCompatibleDataType.\r\nSpecifically, following linked line should convert java Map type to MapRecord recursively. Then isCompatibleDataType didn't have to be modified.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/master/nifi-commons/nifi-record/src/main/java/org/apache/nifi/serialization/record/util/DataTypeUtils.java#L302","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/470434702/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/470580975","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3353#issuecomment-470580975","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3353","id":470580975,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MDU4MDk3NQ==","user":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-07T15:53:18Z","updated_at":"2019-03-07T15:53:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Makes sense to me, I'll take a look at the toRecord() method, you are right that I fixed isCompatibleDataType because that's where I got to in the debugging where the record choice returned not compatible when given a Map.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/470580975/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/470631162","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3339#issuecomment-470631162","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3339","id":470631162,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MDYzMTE2Mg==","user":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-07T18:01:36Z","updated_at":"2019-03-07T18:01:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 LGTM, tried various combinations of property values, verified documentation and processor validity checks all look good.

Casual internet searches for the unique names in the source code don't reveal a commonly-used toolset that NiFi would need compatibility with. Indeed, I am curious as to if this code can even be contributed as Apache License 2.0. \r\n\r\nFrom my understanding, this is basically encryption with AES/CTR/NoPadding and then optional application of a CRC32 or SHA-256 checksum. Both of these tasks (encryption & SHA-256 hashing) can be accomplished using native processors in NiFi currently. This seems like a situation that would be better handled as:\r\n\r\n* From core NiFi -- call the external tool on the command-line using `ExecuteStreamCommand` or write a Groovy/Java script to call the APIs directly using `ExecuteScript`\r\n* Supporting these processors -- it is perfectly acceptable to independently host these processors in a NAR bundle which individual users can download and use, but I don't think the community is prepared to support and maintain this code at this time.

Casual internet searches for the unique names in the source code don't reveal a commonly-used toolset that NiFi would need compatibility with. Indeed, I am curious as to if this code can even be contributed as Apache License 2.0.\r\n> \r\n> From my understanding, this is basically encryption with AES/CTR/NoPadding and then optional application of a CRC32 or SHA-256 checksum. Both of these tasks (encryption & SHA-256 hashing) can be accomplished using native processors in NiFi currently. This seems like a situation that would be better handled as:\r\n> \r\n> * From core NiFi -- call the external tool on the command-line using `ExecuteStreamCommand` or write a Groovy/Java script to call the APIs directly using `ExecuteScript`\r\n> * Supporting these processors -- it is perfectly acceptable to independently host these processors in a NAR bundle which individual users can download and use, but I don't think the community is prepared to support and maintain this code at this time. Many other contributors have gone this route when the use cases they had were extremely specialized\r\n> \r\n> We do obviously appreciate the work that went into this contribution, but I am recommending this PR be closed.\r\n\r\nAndy\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your comments and observations. If I can answer them individually:\r\n1) I will certainly take on board your comments on the code and tests and make sure they are incorporated.\r\n2) This type of wrapping is something we use extensively and thought there may be a wider use case, especially between untrusted and trusted networks. \r\n3) I agree I had overlooked the specification publication (re your comment in the lira ticket). I  need to speak with my Technical Director as to how and where we would publish the specification for the wrapping algorithms.\r\n4)The algorithms also encapsulate the data with reversible functions such as XOR.\r\n5) Is there a proposal to have a 'store' for extension points that would open source, but are not provided as part of the core offering.\r\n6) If you could provide more information (or a template) of how you could do this wrapping with standard processors I would be very interested in seeing this.\r\n\r\nDave","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/470875559/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/470950152","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3358#issuecomment-470950152","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3358","id":470950152,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MDk1MDE1Mg==","user":{"login":"bbende","id":605416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTQxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende","html_url":"https://github.com/bbende","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-08T14:38:56Z","updated_at":"2019-03-08T14:38:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Reviewing...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/470950152/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/470968648","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3358#issuecomment-470968648","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3358","id":470968648,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MDk2ODY0OA==","user":{"login":"bbende","id":605416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTQxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende","html_url":"https://github.com/bbende","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-08T15:31:49Z","updated_at":"2019-03-08T15:31:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks

I tried to do some weird things to see if I could cause any errors, but you seem to have caught all of the corner cases that I could think of :)\r\nI left a handful of comments in the PR, mostly just minor things that need to be addressed, or naming conventions that I felt could be made more clear. Nothing big.\r\n\r\nI did notice a couple of things during testing that I wanted to call out though:\r\n- If I configure a Root Group Port, I have the checkbox for \"Allow Remote Access.\" But if I uncheck it and hit Apply, I get an error. Since we don't allow the user to disable Remote Access, we should not allow them to change that in the UI.\r\n\r\n- If we're going to have the ability to drag a Port on and then configure to set \"Allow Remote Access,\" I feel like the dialog that asks for a name should also include that checkbox so that it can be set when creating the Port.\r\n\r\n- I was a little surprised by the implementation, that a single Local Port can be configured to allow for Remote Access or not, but in either case it still functions as a Local Port. This feels a little odd to me, because a single component on the graph is serving two very different purposes. I feel like it should be either a Local Port or a Remote Port, not both. Thoughts on this?\r\n\r\n- While sending data to a port on a secure instance, I revoked my node's permissions to send data to the port. This worked as expected but produced a confusing error message:\r\n> 2019-03-07 13:44:51,046 ERROR [Timer-Driven Process Thread-1] o.a.n.r.p.socket.SocketClientProtocol SocketClientProtocol[CommsID=43359ff0-85be-42d3-9487-ed2c675c75b2] received unexpected response User Not Authorized: org.apache.nifi.remote.StandardPublicPort@2c831d3f authorization failed for user CN=localhost, OU=NIFI because Unable to modify data transfers to Input Port with ID 5970d42e-0169-1000-ffff-ffffbe062e3b. from Peer[url=nifi://localhost:9001] when negotiating Codec\r\n\r\nA quick search through the PR for the phrase \"modify data transfers\" did not yield any results, so it's possible that this error message has always been like this. If that's the case, then I don't want to hold up this PR for it, but we can probably create a JIRA to make that more clear.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/471046513/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/471051528","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3335#issuecomment-471051528","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3335","id":471051528,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MTA1MTUyOA==","user":{"login":"mcgilman","id":123395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzM5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman","html_url":"https://github.com/mcgilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-08T19:41:28Z","updated_at":"2019-03-08T19:41:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sorry for the delay getting back here. \r\n\r\n@moranr It looks like the dimensions of the Remote Process Group changed to match the height of the Process Group.

DFDL/Daffodil aren't really designed or intended to parse XML data like PUBS. It's theoretically possible, but it's a pain. Generally we reccomend if your data is already in XML then it's beset tod just use one of they XML parsers out there. Where Daffodil really shines is when the data isn't in XML or some readily accessable format. In that case, Daffodil can be used to convert the data to XML so that is is more readily accessable.\r\n\r\nNote that often times the XML you get out of of Daffodil doesn't match what you soemtimes want, due to restrcitions on how DFDL schemas are written and how infoset are represented in XML. For example, MTFXML is a standard that tries to describe USMTF data but in a XML format. Daffodil is not able to convert USMTF data directly to MTFXML. If that was the goal, one would describe USMTF data with a DFDL schema, parse it to an XML representation using Daffodil. and then transform that XML to MTFXML via something like XSLT.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/471072755/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/471072800","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3335#issuecomment-471072800","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3335","id":471072800,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MTA3MjgwMA==","user":{"login":"mcgilman","id":123395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzM5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman","html_url":"https://github.com/mcgilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-08T20:53:29Z","updated_at":"2019-03-08T20:53:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@R-Bower Ok, sounds like we're good with the component dimensions.

Now I think the 'Allow Remote Access' property should be immutable once the LocalPort is created.\r\n\r\nBTW, port type names are confusing. It may be useful if we document it somewhere.. Currently, terminologies are like these with this branch:\r\n- RemotePort: Resides in a RemoteProcessGroup, representing a port at the remote Site-to-Site target NiFi instance.\r\n- RootGroupPort: Resides in the root ProcessGroup of a local flow. Always accessible remotely.\r\n- LocalPort:\r\n    - public LocalPort: Enabled 'Allow Remote Access'. Only accepts incoming connections via S2S.\r\n    - private LocalPort: Only accepts incoming connections via local connections.\r\n\r\n\r\nI will refactor this PR as follows, to make 'Allow Remote Access' immutable:\r\n- Show 'Allow Remote Access' as checkbox at the initial port creation dialog\r\n- After creation, show it as a label in the Port configuration dialog instead of checkbox\r\n- Hide 'Concurrent Tasks' for Local private port.\r\n- Revert some UI Javascripts those were needed to support dynamic port type change\r\n- Modify server side validations those were needed to support dynamic port type change\r\n\r\nFor authorization error message improvement, I created https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-6114","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/471825382/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/471839670","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3366#issuecomment-471839670","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3366","id":471839670,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MTgzOTY3MA==","user":{"login":"alopresto","id":798465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODQ2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/798465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto","html_url":"https://github.com/alopresto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-12T03:23:11Z","updated_at":"2019-03-12T03:23:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Wow, this looks like a very helpful feature for people setting up their NiFi instances.

Though I think rather than a checkbox in the UI indicating whether or not we allow Remote Access... I would lean more toward a drop-down that allows user to choose the type of port: 'Local Port' vs 'Site to Site Port'.\r\n\r\nI also agree that the port terminology is getting a big confusing. I wonder if we should rename `RemotePort` to `RemoteGroupPort`. And then we can probably get rid of `RootGroupPort` all together and instead just have `LocalPort` and `SiteToSitePort` (or whatever we want to call it). The RootGroupPort really was meant to differentiate between a local port and one that is capable of performance site-to-site functions.
