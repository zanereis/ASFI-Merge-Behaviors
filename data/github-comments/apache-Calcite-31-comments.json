I am still unclear that how this should be represented as RelNode. (discussed in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-3787)\r\n\r\n Is it OK for you?\r\n\r\nEDIT: Some other reasons:\r\n1. We still plan to communicate with Presto using SQL.\r\n2. RelNode -> SqlNode is not quite mature I believe, but I may be wrong there.\r\n3. The optimization enabled by RelNode is helpful. But not a high-pri since Presto will also optimize the internal execution plan.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/597447584/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/597447935","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/1849#issuecomment-597447935","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/1849","id":597447935,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NzQ0NzkzNQ==","user":{"login":"HanumathRao","id":5264087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNjQwODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5264087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao","html_url":"https://github.com/HanumathRao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-11T05:13:43Z","updated_at":"2020-03-11T05:13:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Please change the commit message to the correct format, namely [CALCITE-xxxx] ....\r\n\r\nI changed the commit message.

I could do that for something like unnest(employees) as t(e), but I am not sure what's a valid plan for unnest(employees, admins) as t(e, a). Can I just add one test case for something like unnest(employees) as t(e)? Thanks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/598992058/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/599064145","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/1750#issuecomment-599064145","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/1750","id":599064145,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5OTA2NDE0NQ==","user":{"login":"ritesh-kapoor","id":13438145,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDM4MTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13438145?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ritesh-kapoor","html_url":"https://github.com/ritesh-kapoor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ritesh-kapoor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ritesh-kapoor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ritesh-kapoor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ritesh-kapoor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ritesh-kapoor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ritesh-kapoor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ritesh-kapoor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ritesh-kapoor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ritesh-kapoor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-14T13:53:41Z","updated_at":"2020-03-14T13:53:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks
