Although I added the test of this, removed here, the underlying caching pre-dated me (hiding in MultiFields) in Lucene and I don't recall when it was added.  I [asked in Lucene](https://github.com/apache/lucene/pull/11998#issuecomment-1454862916) about the change which brought about the new assertion which prompted reverting this caching.  I don't like the idea of adding more thread-locals as a work-around.  Instead, maybe Solr can avoid some uses of SlowCompositeReaderWrapper where terms is used and retain reasonable performance?  I'm thinking of JoinUtils which could change its algorithm to loop over the leaves instead of assuming one leaf.  For another issue; it's too complicated / exploratory to be in this PR.  There are uses elsewhere too like in Collapsing when top_fc is used.  BTW SlowCompositeReaderWrapper is named this on purpose so that people don't use it ;-)\r\n\r\nIdeally we'd have some benchmark somewhere that uses join queries.  I know @gerlowskija and @joel-bernstein have worked on such as I've code-reviewed related things from them.  They are probably proprietary / not readily available but doesn't hurt to ping them :-).  After this change merges, we could broadcast to the users list that there is a change that maybe has a perf regression, inviting users to test it for themselves soon.  https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/solr-nightly/tags","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1454873263/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1454886054","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1360#issuecomment-1454886054","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1360","id":1454886054,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5Wt8ym","user":{"login":"rmuir","id":504194,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDE5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/504194?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir","html_url":"https://github.com/rmuir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-04T21:16:18Z","updated_at":"2023-03-04T21:16:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Creating this MultiTerms doesn't really do anything.
