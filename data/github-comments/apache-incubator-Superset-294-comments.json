Since the cluster contains multiple application, in order to access superset I need to create baseUrl different from root. \r\nThe inability to change the baseUrl prevents me from accessing through the istio gw with virtual service. So the only option to access the UI is through port-forwarding, something I can not share with product team.\r\nThanks!\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/607424413/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/607424864","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/9439#issuecomment-607424864","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/9439","id":607424864,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwNzQyNDg2NA==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-01T18:42:17Z","updated_at":"2020-04-01T18:42:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9439?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#9439](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9439?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/commit/893c95521b8147cce85eafade9f718867990ff75&el=desc) will **not change** coverage by `%`.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9439/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&height=150&src=pr&token=KsB0fHcx6l)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9439?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@           Coverage Diff           @@\n##           master    #9439   +/-   ##\n=======================================\n  Coverage   59.03%   59.03%           \n=======================================\n  Files         379      379           \n  Lines       12181    12181           \n  Branches     3010     3010           \n=======================================\n  Hits         7191     7191           \n  Misses       4809     4809           \n  Partials      181      181           \n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9439?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [...end/src/SqlLab/components/ExploreResultsButton.jsx](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9439/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-c3VwZXJzZXQtZnJvbnRlbmQvc3JjL1NxbExhYi9jb21wb25lbnRzL0V4cGxvcmVSZXN1bHRzQnV0dG9uLmpzeA==) | `73.75% <ø> (ø)` | |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9439?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9439?src=pr&el=footer).
