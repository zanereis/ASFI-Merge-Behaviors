This is because the check for whether to poll isn't accounting for retriable tuples already being counted in the numUncommittedOffsets count.\r\n\r\nThe current fix is to allow failed tuples to retry always, even if maxUncommittedOffsets is exceeded, because failed tuples don't contribute further to the numUncommittedOffsets count. The problem has been to ensure that we don't also emit a bunch of new tuples when polling for retriable tuples, and end up ignoring maxUncommittedOffsets entirely. This was partially fixed by pausing partitions that have no retriable tuples.\r\n\r\nWith the previous seeking behavior, this was a complete fix, since maxPollRecords put a bound on how far the spout could read from the commit offset in a poll that was ignoring maxUncommittedOffsets. With the new seeking behavior this is broken. If the spout has emitted as many tuples as allowed, and the last (highest offset) tuple fails, the spout may now poll for a full batch of new tuples, starting from the failed tuple. This scenario can repeat arbitrarily many times, so maxUncommittedOffsets is completely ineffective. \r\n\r\nWe don't want to go back to the old seeking behavior (IMO), because it meant that in the case where maxPollRecords is much lower than maxUncommittedOffsets (almost always), the spout might end up choking on failed tuples. For example, if maxPollRecords is 5, and tuple 0-4 are not ready for retry (they might have been retried already, and are now waiting for retry backoff), but tuple 5-9 are, the spout is unable to retry 5-9 (or anything else on that partition) because it keeps seeking back to 0, and polling out the first 5 tuples. Seeking directly to the retriable tuples should in most cases be more efficient as well, because in the old implementation we'd just be seeking to the last committed offset, polling, and discarding tuples until we reach the ones that can be retried.\r\n\r\nWe could probably fix the broken behavior by trying really hard not to emit new tuples when we're ignoring maxUncommittedOffsets, but that seems like it would be error prone and complicated to implement.\r\n\r\nI think we might be able to fix this by ensuring that we don't \"doublecount\" retriable tuples. When the spout is deciding whether to poll, it should deduct retriable tuples from numUncommittedOffsets when comparing to maxUncommittedOffsets.\r\n\r\nChanging the poll check in this way is the same as enforcing the following constraint per partition, it seems to me:\r\n* Poll only if `numNonRetriableEmittedTuples < maxUncommittedOffsets`. If there are more nonretriable tuples than that, the poll won't be allowed because `numUncommittedOffsets = numRetriableTuples + numNonRetriableEmittedTuples`, so `numUncommittedOffsets - numRetriableTuples >= maxUncommittedOffsets`. \r\n\r\nThis should mean that the limit on uncommitted tuples on each partition is going to be `maxUncommittedOffsets + maxPollRecords - 1`, because the latest tuple that can be retried on a partition is the one at offset `maxUncommittedOffsets`, where there are `maxUncommittedOffsets - 1` uncommitted tuples \"to the left\". If the retry poll starts at that offset, it at most emits the retried tuple plus `maxPollRecords - 1` new tuples.\r\n\r\nThere shouldn't be any problems when multiple partitions have retriable tuples, where retriable tuples on one partition might be able to cause a different partition to break the uncommitted offset limit. This is because a partition will at minimum contribute 0 to numUncommittedOffsets (e.g. if all uncommitted tuples on that partition are retriable), because any retriable tuples being subtracted were already counted in numUncommittedOffsets when the tuples were originally emitted.\r\n\r\nIf we can enforce the limit on a per partition basis this way, there's no reason to worry about only emitting retriable tuples when we're exceeding maxUncommittedOffsets. \r\n\r\nI don't think there's a need for pausing partitions anymore either. It was meant to prevent polling for new tuples when there were retriable tuples, but we're no longer trying to prevent that, since the per partition cap is already ensuring we won't emit too many tuples. Pausing in this case would prioritize retriable tuples over new tuples (e.g. in the case where an unpaused consumer might choose to fetch from a nonretriable partition even though there are retriable tuples), but might lead to lower throughput overall (in the case where there are not enough messages on the retriable partitions to fill a batch). I've removed it again.\r\n\r\nI've put up what I hope is the fix both here and on the 1.x branch. Sorry again that this has turned into such a moving target.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/289161328/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612993830","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/6198#issuecomment-2612993830","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/6198","id":2612993830,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI5OTM4MzA=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-24T23:33:22Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T17:01:17Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=roshan_naik\">roshan_naik</a>:</i>\n<p>bump .. <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=ptgoetz\" class=\"user-hover\" rel=\"ptgoetz\">P.

If you have security disabled then this should not be happening, please let me know.  If you have security turned on then it looks like the user you supervisor is running as does not have permission to read that blob.  If you have set <tt>\"nimbus.supervisor.users\"</tt> correctly the blob ACL handler should let the request through.  If that is not working you could also add that user as a nimbus admin user, but that is something you should do with caution, because it gives the supervisor much more power. </p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612701039/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612701045","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/5304#issuecomment-2612701045","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/5304","id":2612701045,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI3MDEwNDU=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-30T14:37:23Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T14:44:40Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=revans2\">revans2</a>:</i>\n<p><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=ipvp\" class=\"user-hover\" rel=\"ipvp\">IPVP</a></p>\n\n<p>Your issue looks different from the other one.
