@congbobo184 thanks for taking up the task for adding the functionality of allowing primitive types to be able to be queried by Pulsar SQL.\r\n> \r\n> I have some concerns/questions:\r\n> \r\n> 1. There are two major items that are covered in this PR: 1) Allowing primitive types to be queryable 2).  Add schema versioning.  Is it possible to have separate these two into independent PRs?  There are a lot of changes in this PR that that can potentially impact performance.  I would recommend having a PR that first enables querying of primitive types and then afterwards have a PR on schema versioning since it seems like adding schema versioning is changing much of how json and avro is deserialized for Pulsar SQL\r\n> 2. For the JSON schema handler you have the core json deserialization library from DslJson to Jackson.  We have benchmarked this before and DslJson is much faster at deserializing JSON than Jackson.  We can do one of two things: 1) keep using DslJson in Pulsar SQL or replace JsonSchema in Pulsar client to use DslJson as well.\r\n\r\nI agree with your suggestion. I will split it into two PR and use DslJson.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/510360071/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/510407244","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/4608#issuecomment-510407244","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/4608","id":510407244,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMDQwNzI0NA==","user":{"login":"yjshen","id":1387718,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODc3MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1387718?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yjshen","html_url":"https://github.com/yjshen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yjshen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yjshen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yjshen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yjshen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yjshen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yjshen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yjshen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yjshen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yjshen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-11T09:24:47Z","updated_at":"2019-07-11T09:24:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@avatart93 , currently with pulsar-spark-connector, you could read multiple topics/partitions of an identical schema as a single DataSet, internally, the consumption of each topic-partition is handled by one task, and inside it, a consumer is used to read data.

And last question, I saw your readme and notice you only do queries, but I can use it for standard basic consumption too right, like just receive messages and put them on rdds, no queries required (lets call it, the classic way).\r\n\r\nIf you want to use RDD directly in your program instead of DataSet, you could just call `.rdd` on the DataSet object. \r\n\r\nI highlight queries in the doc since I thought queries are much easier to use as well as extend because it's typed and save efforts for format parsing, at the same time, the queries are likely to be more efficient since Spark SQL engine do a lot of optimizations not only during planning but also with code generation for efficient execution. Just for your information here.\r\n\r\nFeel free to file issues you meet during using the connector, I'm glad to help.
