What we are doing at Airbnb, is that we are trying to fully integrate Airflow partition sensing with Airflow tables. One problem we have encountered when doing this is keeping track of empty partitions added explicitly via the command:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nINSERT OVERWRITE $TBL\r\nPARTITION (parKey=partVal,...)\r\nSELECT *\r\nFROM $EMPTY_SELECTION\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently there is no way for us to know whether such an insert took place for sensing purposes. We have decided to keep track of these by adding custom properties on `Snapshot::summary` via a subclass of `BaseOvewriteFiles` that captures the `overwriteByRowFilter` passed to find out whether we were inserting a single partition.\r\n\r\nWe want to do the same for `DeleteFiles` so that we know when an empty partition \"gets deleted\", if that makes sense. Unfortunately the default implementation of `DeleteFiles` is protected which means we cannot subclass it outside of the iceberg package.\r\n\r\nNote that we are hoping to keep track of empty partitions without having to do any changes to the way we write to Spark tables, so injecting our custom `OverwriteFiles` and `DeleteFiles` via our custom catalog is the most transparent way we have found to keep track of these expressions without having to change user jobs code.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1169999432/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1170010902","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/5121#issuecomment-1170010902","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/5121","id":1170010902,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85FvPMW","user":{"login":"samredai","id":43911210,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTExMjEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43911210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai","html_url":"https://github.com/samredai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-29T13:53:45Z","updated_at":"2022-06-29T13:53:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"With the new theme we no longer need to add these empty markdown files.

These files are read using what we call a default name mapping specified : https://iceberg.apache.org/spec/#column-projection\r\n\r\n> Tables may also define a property schema.name-mapping.default with a JSON name mapping containing a list of field mapping objects. These mappings provide fallback field ids to be used when a data file does not contain field id information. Each object should contain\r\n> \r\n> names: A required list of 0 or more names for a field.\r\n> field-id: An optional Iceberg field ID used when a field’s name is present in names\r\n> fields: An optional list of field mappings for child field of structs, maps, and lists.\r\n\r\nTo walk through this whole scenario.\r\n\r\nImagine I have a table `A, B, C` which iceberg will internally note as Fields (0, 1, 2)\r\n\r\nI import a file (HiveFile) from hive that contains `A, B, C`. This triggers (at least in some of our actions like Migrate or Snapshot) the creation of a Name Mapping. \r\n```\r\n{ \r\n  A -> 0,\r\n  B -> 1, \r\n  C -> 2\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen reading HiveFile I see that I only have column names, no field IDs are present in the File metadata. So I use the mapping specified above to say which columns actually belong to which fields.\r\n\r\nA file written by any Iceberg writer (IcebergFile) would contain embedded in it the mapping of this particular file. \r\n\r\n```\r\nFooter {\r\n{  iceberg.schema {\r\nA -> 0, B -> 1, C -> 2\r\n}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow when we drop C and ADD C our new Table still has names\r\n`A, B, C` but fields `A -> 0, B->  1, C->3` \r\n\r\nSo for IcebergFile we don't have a problem. Because we look at that file and see it only has field \"2\" not \"3\" so it can't possibly have values for our new C (3).\r\n\r\nNow the Table's name mapping should **not** have changed here. The C that we originally mapped \"C -> 2\" was dropped so we should no longer map the column from the Hive table. But I believe our current behavior is to change the name mapping so that the name mapping also contains \"C -> 3\".

That API fixes several problems, like the one here. The table location should be something that the catalog endpoint can override, rather than requiring the client to produce the correct one.\r\n\r\nI am not sure at the moment. I believe REST catalog is a client for some SERVER that implements the endpoints for these REST catalog calls. Nessie already has its own end points which are not same as what REST catalog expects. I think it is too late to change Nessie endpoints as it will break the compatibility. I might be wrong here. Please correct me If I am mistaken.
