Will ask @wuzhuoming to consider the test-case fixes as part of the original PR and close this

this is not required on branch-2.8 correct?\r\n@virajjasani \r\n\r\n\r\nYes, the plan is to have the PR included in the 2.9 release, but version 2.8 of Ambari had some regrettable issues. PMC member \"wuzhiguo,\" who was involved in the 2.8 release, stepped back from community activities due to some problems. Additionally, version 2.8 had some underlying problems that were subsequently addressed and fixed in later PRs. This has made the release of version 2.8 an awkward situation, with existing bugs and no voting from the community.\r\nHowever, the community contributors have been working diligently to fix many of the issues present in version 2.8 and are preparing for the 2.9 release. After the release, there are plans to provide a series of comprehensive tutorials, covering everything from packaging with Bigtop to installation. Furthermore, a self-developed script for one-click installation of the Bigtop stack in a big data cluster will be provided, aiming to make it more convenient for users to use Ambari.\r\n\r\nThe main challenge currently lies in the PMC members' lack of activity, which is leading to no voting and limited feedback.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/issues/comments/1667160894/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/issues/comments/1672404461","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ambari/pull/3737#issuecomment-1672404461","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/issues/3737","id":1672404461,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACVE2c5jrt3t","user":{"login":"wenwj0","id":36262341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MjYyMzQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36262341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenwj0","html_url":"https://github.com/wenwj0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenwj0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenwj0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenwj0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenwj0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenwj0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenwj0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenwj0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenwj0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenwj0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-10T01:30:35Z","updated_at":"2023-08-10T01:30:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"PhantomJS
