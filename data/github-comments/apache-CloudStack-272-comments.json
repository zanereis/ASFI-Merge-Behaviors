now that you saw the other remarks, the cyclomatic complexity is one issue for sure (most people overlook this, and this is one of the causes of our 1000+ lines methods). There are the others issues that we will probably ignore here, which are the excessive catch of generic exceptions (there is even a catch Throwable… this style of working is one of the causes of those nasty bugs that we sometimes spend hours and days debugging), the manual parse of XML (this trait of manually doing things and not adopting consolidated libraries is one of the causes of excessive code in our code base), and so on.\r\n\r\nTo reinforce what I said before, I raise issues to discuss and to try improving the work that is being proposed. I really do not see the benefit to go to a PR, use my time to go over it and not have an opinion (a critique) to make about it. I would feel like wasting my time then.
