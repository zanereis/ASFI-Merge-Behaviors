Yes, you could remove one. But it seems like you have a problem that you won't learn of any new backends; eventually you won't have any backends.\r\n\r\nIn general, I'd suggest to create a `NameResolver` that parses `BACKEND_SERVICE` and returns the list of all backends. Then gRPC will try each in turn. But it seems like you need to resolve the fact that the backends change but the system won't learn about them.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/419487194/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/419624408","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/1647#issuecomment-419624408","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/1647","id":419624408,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxOTYyNDQwOA==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-08T08:46:51Z","updated_at":"2018-09-08T08:46:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"2 requirements\r\n1.
