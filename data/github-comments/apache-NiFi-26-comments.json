And when I attempted to delete and create/update a connection quickly I saw the system eventually display a warning bulletin that the connection was invalid.\n\nI was unable to trigger any of the IllegalArgumentExceptions that were added to verifyCreate in the StandardConnectionDAO, which made me wonder whether or not recent changes prevented that from even occurring?

ran ConsumePop3 against GMail but hadn't seen your comment on all the dynamic properties that need to be set. I started and stopped the processor, but there is a thread continuing to run. Stopped NiFi but the thread kept going, had to be killed after 20 seconds. Maybe there's a timeout that can be set? \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/237551236/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/237560369","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/782#issuecomment-237560369","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/782","id":237560369,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNzU2MDM2OQ==","user":{"login":"YolandaMDavis","id":1371858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzE4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1371858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YolandaMDavis","html_url":"https://github.com/YolandaMDavis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YolandaMDavis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YolandaMDavis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YolandaMDavis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YolandaMDavis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YolandaMDavis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YolandaMDavis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YolandaMDavis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YolandaMDavis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YolandaMDavis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-04T13:56:42Z","updated_at":"2016-08-04T13:56:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@markap14 all looks good executed tests locally with coverage check, no issues. \n\n+1\n\nWill merge shortly\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/237560369/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/237560639","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/706#issuecomment-237560639","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/706","id":237560639,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNzU2MDYzOQ==","user":{"login":"bbende","id":605416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTQxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende","html_url":"https://github.com/bbende","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-04T13:57:33Z","updated_at":"2016-08-04T13:57:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Tested out the trigger serially and appears to be working as expected.

Did see the error logged \"This node was elected Leader for Role 'Cluster Coordinator' but failed to take leadership. Will relinquish leadership role.\" on one node with error thrown due to the node not being part of the cluster.  That was also followed up with the logged warning \"Failed to determine which node is elected active Cluster Coordinator: ZooKeeper reports the address as 127.0.0.1:11001, but there is no node with this address\".  This occurred during initial startup and appeared to resolve once the cluster coodinator (node 2, on port 11001) came online.\n\nI also shutdown node 2 (which was Cluster Coordinator) and noted the repeated \"Failed to send heartbeat due to: org.apache.nifi.cluster.protocol.ProtocolException: Failed to send message to Cluster Coordinator due to: java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused\" warning in node 1's log.  This was expected based on notes in Jira.  Node 1 was primary node at the time.  When node 2 was back online the heartbeat warning no longer appeared in node 1's log however I could not access node 1's UI (it was displaying an error demonstrated in the snapshot below).\n\nI've included just the nifi-app logs from both servers since it seemed to have the most relevant information.

I just tried it out and was able to replicate the issue. However, with your proposed change, the heading text on the Controller Settings dialog is missing. This is accessed through the global menu and selecting 'Controller Settings'.\n\nI think the underlying issue is that the default visibility is not being set on the settings dialog [1]. By adding `class=\"hidden\"` to the settings div, I believe the issue is resolved. Would you mind trying that locally and if you agree update the PR?\n\nThanks again!\n\n[1] https://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/master/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-framework-bundle/nifi-framework/nifi-web/nifi-web-ui/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/partials/canvas/settings-content.jsp#L18 \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/237940652/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/237942552","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/794#issuecomment-237942552","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/794","id":237942552,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNzk0MjU1Mg==","user":{"login":"alopresto","id":798465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODQ2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/798465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto","html_url":"https://github.com/alopresto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-05T19:33:43Z","updated_at":"2016-08-05T19:33:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Squashed, merged, closed. @scottyaslan got the credit in the commit.

When the coordinator is back online the logs indicate successful reconnection and communication.

I am attempting to test but I think there is something wrong with my Datadog account itself because I tried connecting to it with both NiFi and the OSX Agent and it doesn't get past the initial

when I get things working.\n\nIn the mean time, could you squash your commits so that it'll be easier to merge them into master? We like to have one commit per ticket/PR in order make the history easier to understand.\n\nThanks again @Ramizjon for taking the time work to work on
