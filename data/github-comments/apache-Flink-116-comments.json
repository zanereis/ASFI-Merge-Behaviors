However, you also have a point on the possible confusion. IMHO, I think it is redundant to have two connector modules with almost the same code, and it doesn't also seem feasible for code maintainability to keep adding modules for new Kafka versions even if they don't have changes in the API.\n\nI think we'll need to loop in @rmetzger and @aljoscha to decide on how we can proceed with this. The solutions I currently see is to work on the 0.9 connector on the above problems so it can be compatible with the trivial 0.10 API change, and either rename the module to be `flink-connector-kafka-0.10` (doesn't seem good because it'll be breaking user's pom's), or add information to the documentation on how to work with Kafka 0.10. Either way, in the long-run, we'll probably still need to sort out a way to better manage the connector codes in situations of new external system versions like this.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/233222298/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/233278883","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2240#issuecomment-233278883","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2240","id":233278883,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMzI3ODg4Mw==","user":{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-18T09:03:52Z","updated_at":"2016-07-18T09:03:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@iemejia This is now good to merge?\n\nFrom my side it looks good!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/233278883/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/233283158","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2149#issuecomment-233283158","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2149","id":233283158,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMzI4MzE1OA==","user":{"login":"mxm","id":837221,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNzIyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/837221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm","html_url":"https://github.com/mxm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-18T09:26:50Z","updated_at":"2016-07-18T09:26:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@alkagin I've been on vacations.

Looking at the changes, it looks like it could have been broken up into two pull requests and jira issues. 1) Avoiding duplicate RegisterTaskManager messages 2) Changing core behavior of the ResourceManager.\n\nConcerning 2, I would like to understand why it was necessary to change so much code. It seems like it would have sufficed to change one line of code (not clearing the bookkeeping on leader ship change). I'm not saying your changes don't make sense but I don't think they are backed by the original JIRA issue.\n\nI'm not sure about the role change of the RM in this PR. The RM should be the authority for allocating new resources. If those resources are not properly reported back to the RM (e.g. message loss), the resource allocation won't work properly. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/233291678/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/233294920","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2240#issuecomment-233294920","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2240","id":233294920,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMzI5NDkyMA==","user":{"login":"iemejia","id":79476,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79476?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia","html_url":"https://github.com/iemejia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-18T10:29:47Z","updated_at":"2016-07-18T10:29:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Yes, it is done, I am really happy of getting rid of python/supervisord in the image now.\nPlease merge if you consider it ok.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/233294920/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/233295297","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2240#issuecomment-233295297","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2240","id":233295297,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMzI5NTI5Nw==","user":{"login":"iemejia","id":79476,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79476?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia","html_url":"https://github.com/iemejia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-18T10:32:16Z","updated_at":"2016-07-18T10:32:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"One last thing, are you interested on getting the flink image into becoming an official docker image ?

Since it surfaces as a symptom of the registration problem, I thought about fixing it in the same PR. The separation should be clear (TaskManager vs. RM changes).\n\nThe reason why I had to change more code than this single line is that the RM shouldn't interfere with the TaskManager registration to be on the safe side. As far as I've understood, the RM should tell you about a dying TM but it should not forbid the registration of a TM at the JM. I think that this conservative behaviour is more robust wrt the old behaviour and helps us to not overlook other corner cases.\n\nFurthermore, some of the changes were necessary to make the YARN RM component more easily testable.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/233324256/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/233324330","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2240#issuecomment-233324330","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2240","id":233324330,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMzMyNDMzMA==","user":{"login":"iemejia","id":79476,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79476?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia","html_url":"https://github.com/iemejia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-18T13:13:43Z","updated_at":"2016-07-18T13:13:43Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"About

I finally understood how it works... 😃 \n\nSome remarks about the code: in some places there are method names that seem to stem from an initial implementation but don't match the current code anymore. For example, `SessionEventGeneratorDataSource.createTestStream()` returns a \"generator\" so it could be called `createGenerator()`.  Also, there are some unused methods (for example in `EventGeneratorFactory`) and methods with generated Javadoc that don't have any actual content. Could you please have another pass over the code and remove the unused methods and remove or fix the Javadoc. Some of the classes could also use a class-level Javadoc.\n\nIn `SessionEventGeneratorImpl`, the name `generateLateTimestamp()` might be a bit misleading. It just creates timestamps in the range of allowed timestamps. Both `InLatenessGenerator` and `AfterLatenessGenerator` use the method in the same way, just the behavior of `canGenerateEventAtWatermark()` determines whether the generated elements will be late or not. Here, a good comment on `canGenerateEventAtWatermark()` might help on the base interface. Also, it might make sense to make the testing source non-parallel. If we have parallelism 2 and one source regularly advances the watermark but the other source never advances the watermark the elements that are generated as \"late\" by the first source are not considered late at the window operator because the watermark at the window operator cannot advance.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/233653405/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/233653686","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2221#issuecomment-233653686","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2221","id":233653686,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMzY1MzY4Ng==","user":{"login":"twalthr","id":5746567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDY1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5746567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr","html_url":"https://github.com/twalthr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-19T14:39:10Z","updated_at":"2016-07-19T14:39:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Merging...\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/233653686/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/233654945","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2263#issuecomment-233654945","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2263","id":233654945,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMzY1NDk0NQ==","user":{"login":"StefanRRichter","id":2128543,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjg1NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2128543?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter","html_url":"https://github.com/StefanRRichter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-19T14:43:07Z","updated_at":"2016-07-19T14:43:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks a lot for the review.

Instead we're not clearing the `registeredWorkers` map in the `FlinkResourceManager` when the `JobManager` loses leadership. Thus, the `registeredWorkers` field denotes the successfully started task managers (and the containers they are running in).\n\nAdditionally I reintroduced the reconnect resource manager functionality in the job manager. This should make sure that the resource manager is eventually notified about newly registered resources. In the current implementation, however, the resource manager will always accept the register resource messages.
