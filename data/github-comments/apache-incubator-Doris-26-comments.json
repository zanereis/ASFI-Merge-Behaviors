But there always are some long tail task in our online environment, once a task is executed slowly, it will block all the http request on the same thread .

\r\nadd ability for processing wildcard index ?\r\n\r\n由于涉及中文字段的长度加工与计算（char_length, strleft与strright）的使用，近期将Doris升级到最新版本（2020-06-11 Git Clone），但造成了通配符指定index的Table无法查询，提示错误信息如下：\r\n\r\n`\r\nfetch es table [sometable] metadata failure: index[sometable-*] not found for the Elasticsearch Cluster'\r\n`\r\n\r\n旧版本中，这个功能是正常使用的，请问是重构后引入问题吗？有什么办法能支持使用通配么？\r\n\r\n在此感谢Doris各位开发者的无私奉献 :)
