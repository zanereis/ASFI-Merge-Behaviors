Add spotless phoenix pre commit check\r\n\r\nAlso need to break the \"machinery\" part into tasks: task 1 and task 3 as we may want to add to pre-commit only after all issues are fixed with task2. This way we can have ease of backporting as well since task 2 generated code may differ for all branches.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/2422646833/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/2422656830","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/phoenix/pull/1995#issuecomment-2422656830","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/1995","id":2422656830,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAThmSs6QZs8-","user":{"login":"lfrancke","id":122850,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjg1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122850?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfrancke","html_url":"https://github.com/lfrancke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfrancke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfrancke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfrancke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfrancke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfrancke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfrancke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfrancke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfrancke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lfrancke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-18T14:50:11Z","updated_at":"2024-10-18T14:50:11Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Excellent, in that case I just misread.

Moreover, we might cause regression if we try to change the client aggregation interface to manage both \"count(*)\" and \"entire row\" return cases.\r\n- We need server to return full row as result for the atomically deleted row, and let the client parse the result correctly and return to user as new PhoenixStatement API.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we need special code path that changes both client and server for the specific \"single row atomic delete\" case. I don't think there is any other way we can achieve both of above goals without the risk of causing some regression with old and new clients.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/2480446049/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/2480465156","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/phoenix/pull/2027#issuecomment-2480465156","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/2027","id":2480465156,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAThmSs6T2OUE","user":{"login":"stoty","id":304757,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDc1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/304757?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty","html_url":"https://github.com/stoty","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-16T07:36:37Z","updated_at":"2024-11-16T07:36:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"As

I checked in out case and we login every day once only. As it was there before as well and wasn't really a problem and can be improved with next ticket for below\r\n> We would need to dig into whether we correctly support working on Connections with different principals correctly before/after my patch.\r\nMy gut feeling is that that would require checking the current principal in every JDBC entry point, and logging into it if needed when being called, and I don't remember us doing that.\r\nEven if didn't work correctly before, we don't need to fix that in this ticket, only solve the perf regression, but we need to understand the thread/principal flow to decide where we need to perform the kerberos login optimally.\r\nIt would be great if you could dig into this @lokiore. If you do not have the time/inclination, then let me know and I will take this up.\r\n\r\nAnd sure I would like to take this up and will create another ticket for same..\r\n\r\n- And next one will be work on it a little more and update cached configuraiton when we are updating config with principle and keytab :- for this I still think we will need to invalidateCacheConfiguraiton and that would require creating new config and same regression will be there in case of kerberos change so not much gain for this ticket and aligns more with next ticket?\r\n\r\n@stoty let me know your thoughts on this, and please correct me if any of the assumption or pointers are wrong.

This makes sure that when the cell timestamp does not agree with the encoded value on the row key, we use the encoded value. This happens for delete makers. In order to extract the encoded value, we need to know if the index is a partitioned index (multi-tenanted or view index). This required making the corresponding attributes of IndexMaintainer accessible publicly. In addition to that I improved the test code and made sure including PARTITION_ID() and PHOENIX_ROW_TIMESTAMP() expressions in the WHERE clause of the CDC query is properly handled.
