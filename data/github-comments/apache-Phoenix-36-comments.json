Would that cause the region to crash from trying to load an enum value that doesn't exist? If so, what sort of upgrade logic should we include? I can think of three options:\r\n 1. Switch tables to non-transactional \r\n 2. Switch tables to Omid \r\n 3. Keep the Tephra enum and just WARN or ERROR on region load that it doesn't do anything \r\n\r\n1 and 2 are both tricky to coordinate on a rolling restart, because the normal upgrade logic runs when SYSTEM.CATALOG is upgraded, but the crashing would probably come before that, when a region hosting a TEPHRA-enabled table has its region server upgraded. But I worry that some operators would miss the warning in their logs. \r\n \r\n@stoty @jpisaac @kadirozde @virajjasani , curious on your opinions.
