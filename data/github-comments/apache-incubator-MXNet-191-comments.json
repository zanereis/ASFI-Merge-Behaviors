issue was resolved by tweaking the _update_params(..) function in [model.py](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/master/python/mxnet/model.py) with the function below. \r\n\r\nNOTE: this does not support multiple devices, the way the original MxNet code does. It rather changes the dictionary keys (index passed to updater) to the parameter names, so that if the graph is dynamic, the newly created states in updater are attached to the right names. This is essential since for a dynamic graph list indexing is not preserved from one graph to the next. Therefore, the initial implementation does not support it. However, as noted this is just a temporary hack.\r\n\r\nAfter changing the function, the arg_names and param_names should be passed to _update_params() in function update() in file [module.py](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/master/python/mxnet/module/module.py).\r\ni.e.: \r\n```\r\n_update_params(self._exec_group.param_arrays,\r\n                           self._exec_group.grad_arrays,\r\n                           updater=self._updater,\r\n                           num_device=len(self._context),\r\n                           kvstore=self._kvstore,\r\n                           param_names=self._exec_group.param_names,\r\n                           arg_names=self._exec_group.arg_names)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is the tweaked version of _update_params(..) in file  [model.py](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/master/python/mxnet/model.py)\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef _update_params(param_arrays, grad_arrays, updater, num_device,\r\n                   kvstore=None, param_names=None, arg_names=None):\r\n    \"\"\" Perform update of param_arrays from grad_arrays not on kvstore.\"\"\"\r\n    if param_names==None and arg_names==None:\r\n        for index, pair in enumerate(zip(param_arrays, grad_arrays)):\r\n            arg_list, grad_list = pair\r\n            if grad_list[0] is None:\r\n                continue\r\n            if kvstore:\r\n                # push gradient, priority is negative index\r\n                kvstore.push(index, grad_list, priority=-index)\r\n                # pull back the sum gradients, to the same locations.\r\n                kvstore.pull(index, grad_list, priority=-index)\r\n            for k, p in enumerate(zip(arg_list, grad_list)):\r\n                # faked an index here, to make optimizer create diff\r\n                # state for the same index but on diff devs, TODO(mli)\r\n                # use a better solution latter\r\n                w, g = p\r\n                updater(index*num_device+k, g, w)\r\n    elif param_names!=None and arg_names!=None:\r\n        ctr = -1\r\n        for i, index in enumerate(arg_names):\r\n            if index in param_names:\r\n                ctr += 1\r\n                arg_list  = param_arrays[ctr]\r\n                grad_list = grad_arrays[ctr]\r\n\r\n                if grad_list[0] is None:\r\n                    continue\r\n                if kvstore:\r\n                    # push gradient, priority is negative index\r\n                    kvstore.push(ctr, grad_list, priority=-ctr)\r\n                    # pull back the sum gradients, to the same locations.\r\n                    kvstore.pull(ctr, grad_list, priority=-ctr)\r\n\r\n                for k, p in enumerate(zip(arg_list, grad_list)):\r\n                    w, g = p\r\n                    # This deos not support the diff device implemented in the \r\n                    # if statement above.
