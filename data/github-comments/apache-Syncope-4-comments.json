I fixed few checkstyle violations (you'll have to build from root folder via `mvn clean install` to perform all necessary checks that Travis CI mostly skips, due to timing constraints)\r\n1. I removed one-line, single-use methods\r\n1. I verified, by running the whole integration test suite against the different environments via the various IT profiles under `fit/core-reference/pom.xml` - the compatibility of your changes with:\r\n    * PostgreSQL\r\n    * MySQL\r\n    * PostgreSQL JSONB\r\n    * MySQL JSON (which for some reason did not like the new `getAdminRealmsFilter()`, so I had to keep it old-style just for it)\r\n    * Elasticsearch\r\n\r\nAll works fine, thanks @DmitriyBrashevets for your

Need to figure out how to add checks for each panel to prevent from advancing to the next step in the wizard if selections (user, resource, etc) are not met. I have not found a good example on this, and did experiment with callbacks such as `applyState` and `isComplete` in the wizard, but none is ideal. Is there a good reference on how this might be done? or shall I drop this bit for now, with the assumptions that admin user driving the wizard would make the right selections before moving onto the next step.
