Currently trying it out locally.\n\nRegarding the exception catching in the metrics: I can't decide whether we should try to write all metrics in such a way that they can't throw exceptions, or write the reporters in such a way that they can deal with it. (usually by logging the exception). The first option is safer considering custom reporters, but the second will allows us to properly log them.\n\nRegarding a test: While i agree that such a test would be nice i can only come up with icky ways to test it. You have to access the metric _while a job is running_ as they are removed afterwards. So you either have to submit a job that blocks until _something_ happens, or you add a reporter that feeds that information back to the test _somehow_.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/229096552/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/229130136","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1517#issuecomment-229130136","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1517","id":229130136,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyOTEzMDEzNg==","user":{"login":"greghogan","id":569655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2OTY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/569655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan","html_url":"https://github.com/greghogan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-28T17:57:55Z","updated_at":"2016-06-28T17:57:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 with just a few superficial comments.\n\nReading back through the discussion I see that there are many ideas for future performance enhancements.

I just reported my observation while trying this PR out. \n\nYou're right that it would blow up the scope of this PR. I guess the easiest solution would be to properly document the behaviour when a user submits jobs with the same name and to tell him that he should rather use the job id in this case.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/229651459/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/229651889","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2108#issuecomment-229651889","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2108","id":229651889,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyOTY1MTg4OQ==","user":{"login":"rmetzger","id":89049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger","html_url":"https://github.com/rmetzger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-30T13:05:32Z","updated_at":"2016-06-30T13:05:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you for your review @tillrohrmann and @zentol .

I have three questions:\n1. This container is based on the Java JRE (to keep it small), Does Flink in any part do some magic that requires a full JDK (like live recompiles) ? If no, I think this is almost perfect now.\n2. Are you aware of any other flink dependency that uses any native OS library (I ask this because if this is the case it must be added to the container, I did this for snappy because I found the issue while testing a Beam pipeline, but I don't know if there are others).\n3. In the docker image I left supervisor because I didn't find an easy way to start flink in normal mode, the scripts to start both taskmanager and jobmanager go into daemon mode immediately, is there something that can be done to change this (this will reduce the image in 40 more MB), but well I can work on that for a different PR.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/229664500/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/229666407","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2108#issuecomment-229666407","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2108","id":229666407,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyOTY2NjQwNw==","user":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-30T13:58:57Z","updated_at":"2016-06-30T13:58:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Changes look good to me @rmetzger :-) I had only some minor comments. +1 for merging after addressing the comments.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/229666407/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/229668327","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2186#issuecomment-229668327","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2186","id":229668327,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyOTY2ODMyNw==","user":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-30T14:05:02Z","updated_at":"2016-06-30T14:05:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It works also offline but you won't have the anchor functionality available.
