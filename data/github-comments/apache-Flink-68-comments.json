starting, but mesos fails to detect that is actually not properly starting. I also can not see that the TM is registering itself at the JM.\nI suspect that the TaskManagerExecutor is not properly forwarding/catching the exception from Flink.\n\nI still believe that the JobManager is starting on the same JVM as the Scheduler. How can I start Flink in a way that the JobManager is running within a Mesos Task, instead of the client.\n\nPlease note that I'm off for vacation for two weeks, starting from now.

The additional job executes the full program and samples at the end. Imagine a complex program that includes for instance several joins and wants to write out the result in a total order, i.e., range partitions and sorts the result before it writes to the final sink. With the current implementation, this would mean that the expensive job is executed twice.\n\nIt would be better to inject the sampling into the actual job. This can be done for example as follow.\nFor a program such as:\n\n```\nDataSet x = ...\nx.rangePartition(0).reduce(...)\n```\n\ncould be translated into:\n\n```\nDataSet<X> x = ...\nDataSet<Distr> dist = x.mapPartition(\"sample\").reduce(\"collect samples and build distribution\");\nDataSet<Tuple2<Integer,X>> xWithPIDs = x\n  .map(\"assign PartitionIDs).withBroadcastSet(dist, \"distribution\");\n```\n\nThis would inject the sampling into the original program. The sampling is done as before, but the data distribution is broadcasted to a map operator that uses the distribution to assign partition IDs to records and converts the `DataSet<X>` into a `DataSet<Tuple2<Integer, X>>` similar as the `KeySelector`. Once the partition IDs are assigned, a RangePartitionOperator could partition the tuples on the first field (f0) with a simple Int-DataDistribution (0,1,2,3,4,..., n). Finally, the DataSet needs to be unwrapped, i.e, converted from `DataSet<Tuple2<Integer,X>>` to `DataSet<X>`. \n\nI agree it is not super nice, but this implementationx would cache the intermediate result instead of recomputing it. In addition it barely touches the internals.\n\nIt is also possible to integrate the partitioning more tightly into the runtime by providing the data distribution directly to the Partitioner. However, that would mean we need to implement a partitioning operator for the runtime (instead of using the regular operator and a NOOP driver).\n\nBtw. I have some code lying around (for a not-yet-completed features) to extract keys from a record given the key specification. Let me know if that would help for your implementation. \n\nRegarding the implementation of the `Partitioner` and `OutputEmitter`, I am very open for suggestions for how to improve the design. As you said, I would bring this discussion to the dev mailing list or open a JIRA and start a discussion there.\n\nWhat do you think?

Not all methods without paremeters should translate to methods without parenthesis...\n\n@StephanEwen I agree with that, but I cannot understand how the `UnitTypeInfo` might cause a confusion here.\n\nThe `TypeInformation` instances are synthesized by the macro based on the inferred `DataSet` type, which means that the meaning of `()` is resolved before that. Consider the following example:\n\n``` scala\n// in the Scala REPL\n\ncase class Foo(answer: Int)\n// defined class Foo\n\ndef f1(): Foo = Foo(42)\n// f1: ()Foo\n\ndef f2: Foo = Foo(42)\n// f2: Foo\n\nval xs = Seq(f1(), f2) // how a literate person would write it\n// xs: Seq[Foo] = List(Foo(42), Foo(42))\n\nval xs = Seq(f1, f2) // how a dazed & confused person would write it, but still compiles  \n// xs: Seq[Foo] = List(Foo(42), Foo(42))\n\nval xs = Seq(f1, f2()) // even worse, but this breaks with a compiler exception\n// error: Foo does not take parameters\n//       val xs = Seq(f1, f2())\n\nval xs = Seq((), ()) // typing '()' without syntactic context resolves to Unit\n// xs: Seq[Unit] = List((), ())\n```\n\nIn all of the above situations `env.fromCollection(xs)` is (i) either going to typecheck and trigger `TypeInformation` synthesis or (ii) fail with the above.\n\nCan you point to StackOverflow conversation or something similar where the issue you mention is explained with an example?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/148901986/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/148939135","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1259#issuecomment-148939135","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1259","id":148939135,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0ODkzOTEzNQ==","user":{"login":"hsaputra","id":105434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTQzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/105434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra","html_url":"https://github.com/hsaputra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-17T18:20:12Z","updated_at":"2015-10-17T18:20:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@StephanEwen

Since\nthis is hard to spot if you don’t look at the definition of foobar and the\nresulting type we decided to stick to a common pattern to always add\nparentheses to overriden java methods. Of course, there are situations\nwhere this is not needed but then the rule wouldn’t be so simple anymore.\n​\n\nOn Sat, Oct 17, 2015 at 12:18 PM, Alexander Alexandrov <\nnotifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> Not all methods without paremeters should translate to methods without\n> parenthesis...\n> \n> @StephanEwen https://github.com/StephanEwen I agree with that, but I\n> cannot understand how the UnitTypeInfo might cause a confusion here.\n> \n> The typeInformation macros are synthesized by the macro based on the\n> inferred collection type, which means that the meaning of () is resolved\n> before that.
