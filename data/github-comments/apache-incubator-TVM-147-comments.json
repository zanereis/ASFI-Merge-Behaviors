The problem seems to be that \"Array\" is not an \"Expr\". make.Call [expects](https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/blob/master/src/api/api_ir.cc#L102) its argument to be \"Array\\<Expr\\>\", but if we pass a python list, which converts to \"Array\", TVM complains that \"Array\" is not an \"Expr\". The error message is confusing, but the actual error occurs [here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/blob/master/include/tvm/packed_func_ext.h#L70), where TVM tries to type check Array elements type. The element type should be \"Expr\", but if we pass a list as an additional argument, the type checking fails because we passed \"Array\", not \"Expr\". \r\n\r\nThe reason we can pass Tensors is that, before TVM passes python arguments to C++,  TVM replaces Tensors with \"a Call expression that returns Tensor\" [(here)](https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/blob/master/python/tvm/intrin.py#L41-L42). We need something similar for lists, but that doesn't seem to exist now.\r\n\r\nSo we need to give up on our approach. Can you add python functions conv2d_forward and conv3d_forward? Once the CI passes, I'll check the std::vector issue and then merge.

for the proposal. One potential alternative to the fix point is to make use of integer arithmetics instead. The quantization pass in the relay pass should be able to turn floating pt into integer arithmetics, and we only need to support vector integer ariths.\r\n\r\nFor a given fixed point configuration, there is a one to one mapping from fixed point arithmetic and \r\nthe corresponding integer arithmetics(via mul and shift).
