Although keeping efficiency in mind is always great, I see two problems:\r\n1. There is a bug in detecting whether the result of slice is contiguous or not, as evident in my example. There is no difference between indexing [0:1] and indexing [0:1, :]. The code assumes if you pass in the second dimension it won't be contiguous.\r\n2. Even with proper documentation and correct contiguous buffer detection, I feel the behavior is too ambiguous. As a user you don't know what you'll get! Is it a copy or should I create a copy to make sure I'm not modifying the original array? This can make the overall  code even less efficient. Most people may be surprised with the copy implementation as the name and API both imply Numpy behavior. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/352682508/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/352692329","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/9135#issuecomment-352692329","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9135","id":352692329,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MjY5MjMyOQ==","user":{"login":"rahul003","id":3457240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTcyNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3457240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003","html_url":"https://github.com/rahul003","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-19T09:47:23Z","updated_at":"2017-12-19T09:47:23Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks @pracheer for your comments.

These examples are not directly related to distributed training. I merged them with this PR, because I made a modification to the example I refer to in the tutorial (example/gluon/image_classification.py) required for distributed training. This change necessitated modifying rest of the examples. The old form of these examples requires the directory structure of mxnet and lot of files other than the example script itself. Moving that code to test_utils ensures that if the user just has the example script, it will still run.

 \r\n\r\nI tried the code you've sent me (exact copy/paste), I again obtain the same error - can this be a version related error? In addition, from the documentation of [ndarray.UpSampling](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/python/ndarray/ndarray.html#mxnet.ndarray.UpSampling) the ```num_filter``` variable is not related (at least to my understanding) to the number of channels of the input, e.g. for input ```shape = [2,16,256,256]``` the variable ```num_filter``` is not related to the number ```shape[1]==16```, it is somehow related to the bilinear interpolation. By the way, the argument ```num_args``` doesn't appear in the official documentation either.  \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n## Code:\r\n\r\n```Python\r\nimport mxnet as mx\r\nimport mxnet.ndarray as

Otherwise,\r\n* Users need to understand gpu state is not thread-safe, and pick a curand state in `Op::Map`, then loop the array carefully.\r\n* The implementation of `Launch` implies two adjacent array entries are accessed by two adjacent threads in one block. But in my understanding, we should generate successive numbers from one state, i.e., one thread, as much as we can. With `Launch`, this will make users suffering calculating the array element index, which can easily make mistake and the codes will be weird.\r\n* The curand states are allocated in global memory. For efficiency, we copy it to local memory when launching a kernel (and copy back to global at the end, as suggested in NV's doc).

In fact, I found that the error seems to trigger in the _getdata method of NDArrayIter, where self.data seems to be broken (after some iterations, even a simple `print self.data` triggers the exception).\r\n\r\nI'm going to do some more tests, though.\r\n\r\nBtw, you mean range `[0, input_dim-1]`, right?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/353454088/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/353462435","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/8874#issuecomment-353462435","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/8874","id":353462435,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MzQ2MjQzNQ==","user":{"login":"larroy","id":928489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyODQ4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/928489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy","html_url":"https://github.com/larroy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-21T21:30:17Z","updated_at":"2017-12-21T21:30:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Mxnet should be portable.
