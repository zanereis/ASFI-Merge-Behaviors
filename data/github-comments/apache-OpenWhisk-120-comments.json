I'll see what I can do to break it up as it leaves WIP; some of the changes can be added now and still test clean.  (And yes, I did include one other change as I was working that deserves to be its own separate PR.  Too many branches going right now...)\r\n\r\nThe reason for deleting the actionRuntime directories at the same time as changing the manifest behavior was to ensure during testing that the new manifest behavior didn't have some leftover dependency on the 'whisk/*' images and their being pulled in './gradlew distDocker'.  If we're nervous, we can put them back, but as other pieces move, they become unneeded and confusing.  I'd definitely advise following up with a second PR not too soon after.\r\n\r\nThanks for pointing out the artifacts from those directories that are worth saving.  They can be moved into 'tools' and 'docs' with a little work.  We'll leave this PR and notes as WIP to guide the staged implementation as well as an opportunity to run Travis over the whole enchilada.  I'd suggest three PR's:\r\n\r\n1.  Additional configuration variables and ansible changes that can work with the existing codebase.\r\n2.  The invoker changes to use the 'openwhisk/' prefix for runtimes and accept directly-pulled images, including any additional ansible changes needed in support.\r\n3.  Move identified useful artifacts into `tools` and `docs`.  Document appropriately.\r\n4.  Progressively remove standalone 'actionContainer' tests to the repositories creating those containers and remove corresponding runtime directories.  Disable build of those Docker images.\r\n5.  Move the useful artifacts from the 'actionRuntimes' and delete the remaining actionRuntimes directory tree (and Travis changes to remove from the ignores list).\r\n\r\nOnce all that is done, I can move on to my original goal of converting from 'distDocker' to 'gradle-docker-plugin' to make multi-architecture builds more accessible and less of a maintenance headache.\r\n\r\nSound good @rabbah @markusthoemmes ?  (Meanwhile, back to figuring out why Travis is failing, then I'll probably still want a PG to see what I broke in Functions.)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/371171374/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/371173849","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/3382#issuecomment-371173849","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/3382","id":371173849,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MTE3Mzg0OQ==","user":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-07T15:24:31Z","updated_at":"2018-03-07T15:24:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"As a general note: It would be useful in the long run to consolidate this and scripts like it into wskadmin (and rearchitect that accordingly).
