We saw this issue when our streams in EMR cluster had to be bought down and restarted on another EMR cluster & were able to verify this fix using the same approach. \r\nSo, all-in-all - I might be needing a unit test which spans across 2 sparkSessions & try this; the way tests are written is needing a bit of refactor to make it use 2 spark sessions & even after that I am unsure - if this will reproduce this (given the process sharing). Is there any precedence in the codebase for this pattern that you could kindly point me to.\r\n\r\nI have put the fix before even I have that unit test before the public - **for visibility** - so ppl. can port it as needed. This bug is essentially a **time bomb** in the code (which blasts off the moment a stream moves across clusters) whoever is using readStream from iceberg table & have first snapshot expired; which is almost everyone who uses this! \r\n\r\nLet me try that 2 spark sessions creation unittest and get back.\r\n\r\nputting the problem being explained above aside - the code itself has coverage in this unittest - `testResumingStreamReadFromCheckpoint` - using which I was able to debug thru & fix the code - where I need to use `file.createOrOverwrite()` instead of the existing `file.create()`.\r\n\r\ncc: @rajarshisarkar  ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1086892995/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1086902128","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4439#issuecomment-1086902128","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4439","id":1086902128,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85AyM9w","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-03T16:27:11Z","updated_at":"2022-04-03T16:27:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think this should be split into different PRs for specific fixes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1086902128/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1086903715","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4458#issuecomment-1086903715","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4458","id":1086903715,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85AyNWj","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-03T16:36:31Z","updated_at":"2022-04-03T16:36:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@samredai, do we need to port this over to iceberg-docs?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1086903715/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1086915815","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4416#issuecomment-1086915815","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4416","id":1086915815,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85AyQTn","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-03T17:43:29Z","updated_at":"2022-04-03T17:43:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks, @jun-he!
