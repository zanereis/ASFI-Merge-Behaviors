think best approach would be to utilize option 1) in combination with allowing the user to specify a custom size by instantiating ``NodeImage`` class with custom values.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of a driver which does that - https://libcloud.readthedocs.io/en/stable/compute/drivers/cloudsigma.html#create-a-server-using-a-custom-node-size\r\n\r\nFor custom attributes which are not supported by the ``NodeImage`` class you either have a choice of utilizing ``NodeImage`` class directly and putting custom attributes into ``extra`` directory or by subclassing it.\r\n\r\nUtilizing ``NodeImage`` directly is preferred over custom sub-class (especially if other custom attributes are optional - this way it still works out of the box with \"standard\" NodeImage class instances).\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nEDIT: And where it makes sense and it's also applicable to other drivers / providers, we could perhaps also add some new standard attributes to the base / standard ``NodeImage`` class.\r\n\r\nThings such as ``disk_type`` (hdd, ssd, etc.) come to mind.\r\n\r\nOriginal ``NodeImage`` class implementation is quite old now and at that time providers didn't support things such as different disk types so it might make sense to extend it (and for backward compatibility reasons, we can default to
