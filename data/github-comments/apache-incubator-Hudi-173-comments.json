@vinothchandar  Thanks for your attention. \r\nActually S3 java SDK take care of these retry logic through config `fs.s3a.attempts.maximum`\r\n\r\nThe necessary to build a retry layer on hudi is to let hudi can deal with different kinds of filesystem not only S3.\r\nAfter careful thinking maybe it's not urgent for this patch and will close it.\r\nMaybe we can reopen this patch if there's another fs need to let hudi take care of retring.\r\n\r\nAnyway, really appreciate for @nsivabalan and @vinothchandar 's attention.

The main changes are:\r\n> \r\n> 1. Unify bucket index configurations to the HoodieIndexConfig\r\n> 2. On the premise that bucket index key has to be the subset of the record key, get the index key value at the runtime from HoodieKey by a tricky way without destroying the data structure. `BucketIdentifier` is introduced to do it.\r\n> 3. When `tag location`, cache the partial filesystem view in each Spark task. The implementation is different from bloom index which caches hoodie key and file name first and then join with the input data. Bucket Index is proposed to processing more bigger data and join is a heavy operation. Therefore, hoodieRecordRDD to taggedRecordRDD is a mapPartition only operation.\r\n\r\n@vinothchandar, here is the summary after all comments

And you are asking why do we need to do this and why not just drop the column altogether?\r\n\r\nYes that's largely the question. We assumed it would be dropped as the deleted records are not persisted and it's otherwise redundant, and there already seems to be codepaths to drop redundant columns (e.g. `hoodie.datasource.write.drop.partition.columns`)\r\n\r\nWe were also caught out when we used a string value by mistake. This ended up being written to the end datastore, which then broke our schema in a seemingly non-recoverable way (as it was written to the table, and now we had a schema type change from `string`->`boolean` when trying to write the correct value which wasn't obviously compatible). \r\n\r\nI'd suggest:\r\n* Possibly dropping the column (as you say if it has little benefits sure). If not, documenting the behaviour somewhere. Alternatively, always include the column, along with the other Hudi metadata fields which are prepended to written schema already.\r\n* If the column is not a boolean:\r\n\t* Failing hard, as this column is essentially \"reserved\" for Hudi\r\n\t* Taking `IS NOT NULL` as truthy","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/976248107/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/976292947","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/3857#issuecomment-976292947","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3857","id":976292947,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM46MQxT","user":{"login":"hudi-bot","id":79415918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDE1OTE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79415918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/hudi-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-23T08:51:33Z","updated_at":"2021-11-23T08:51:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\nMeta

looks good. But why introduce a new block type and not do it for the HoodieHFileDataBlock itself?\r\n\r\nWhen the HFile format is used, whether for Metadata Table or elsewhere in HUDI, there will always be a key for the HFile and they will be derived from some field of the record. Hence, this HFile key will always be redundant. Therefore this optimization needs to performed for HoodieHFileDataBlock itself.\r\n\r\nHoodieHFileDataBlock already accepts a \"keyField\". We can simply this change by:\r\n1. If keyField is not None: \r\n    - set keyField to \"null\" and do not save it\r\n    - materialize the keyField from HFile key\r\n 2. If keyField is None - no need to do the above\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/977583545/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/977592359","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/4093#issuecomment-977592359","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/4093","id":977592359,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM46ROAn","user":{"login":"hudi-bot","id":79415918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDE1OTE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79415918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/hudi-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-24T07:09:57Z","updated_at":"2021-11-24T07:09:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\nMeta

Probably better option is to avoid modifying the Map in first place. This can be done by grouping based on fileId i.e., replace line 78 -88 with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nMap<String, HoodieBaseFile> baseFilesForCommittedFileIds = committedBaseFiles\r\n        // Remove files replaced by current inflight commit\r\n        .filter(baseFile -> !replacedFileIdsForPartition.contains(baseFile.getFileId()))\r\n        collect(Collectors.toMap(HoodieBaseFile::getFileId, baseFile -> baseFile))\r\n\r\nbaseFilesForCommittedFileIds.putAll(newFilesWrittenForPartition)\r\nreturn baseFilesForCommittedFileIds.values().stream();\r\n```\r\nThis needs some more testing. I can send PR next week.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/978407363/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/978410027","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/4097#issuecomment-978410027","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/4097","id":978410027,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM46UVor","user":{"login":"bhasudha","id":2179254,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzkyNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179254?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhasudha","html_url":"https://github.com/bhasudha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhasudha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhasudha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhasudha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhasudha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhasudha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhasudha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhasudha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhasudha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhasudha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-24T23:01:15Z","updated_at":"2021-11-24T23:01:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"For flattening transformer no special configs are required.
