Thanks for updating the gifs, now it is clear to me except one thing. When the second notebook had `user1` written and the first notebook executed the paragraph with `admin` written, `user1` was not replaced by admin at first. But then it was. **How do I get the remote changes / discard my local changes** because otherwise as soon as I have local changes I cannot get the remote changes, can I?\r\n\r\nI also agree with your google docs reference. However a good first step would be an indicator that someone has the same notebook open. Next level is an indicator on a paragraph level. This solves most of the conflicts as I can usually just ask my colleague what he was planning or we are on a webex. After that it would of course be great to see where the cursor is but that's just the frosting of the cake :)\r\n\r\nThanks for taking care!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/288645276/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/288646148","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2177#issuecomment-288646148","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2177","id":288646148,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4ODY0NjE0OA==","user":{"login":"FRosner","id":3427394,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjczOTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3427394?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner","html_url":"https://github.com/FRosner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-23T08:14:13Z","updated_at":"2017-03-23T08:14:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Gotcha @1ambda,\r\n\r\nThe gifs make it clear now, thanks! Not sure about the exact code changes as I'm not that familiar with the code base you're touching.

If we combine it with save-on-lost-focus the time window is at least lower to get your changes overwritten.\r\n\r\nJust one more related question: I noticed that there is a save timer for notebooks in the code.
