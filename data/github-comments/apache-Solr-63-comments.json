I can imagine scenarios where an advanced user might want to enable this feature, but still be able to exempt certain queries.  (Perhaps they know that certain fields are low-cardinality enough to be \"safe\", etc.)  Is it worth adding a query-param feature flag, that can be used to disable the limit on a query-by-query basis?\r\n2. Some faceting codepaths run prefix queries in the course of processing certain types of facets.  Should we enforce this limit on these codepaths or skip it?\r\n3. Is there any value in expanding the limit to cover field types other than 'string' and 'text'?\r\n\r\nOther TODOs:\r\n  - ~ref-guide docs~\r\n  - ~additional testing~\r\n  - ~tidy/check.~","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2150379839/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2150480373","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2497#issuecomment-2150480373","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2497","id":2150480373,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6ALbn1","user":{"login":"dsmiley","id":377295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzI5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/377295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley","html_url":"https://github.com/dsmiley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-05T16:26:48Z","updated_at":"2024-06-05T16:26:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"References to JavaVersion (a Gradle class) like `>= JavaVersion.VERSION_16` should be reviewed to see if we can make changes to remove conditions that will no longer vary.\r\n\r\nSearching for \"Java 17\" or \"JDK 17\" or similar searches or other versions can reveal stuff where maybe a change is needed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2150480373/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2151143368","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1994#issuecomment-2151143368","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1994","id":2151143368,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6AN9fI","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-06T00:00:34Z","updated_at":"2024-06-06T00:00:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This PR had no visible activity in the past 60 days, labeling it as stale.

The JIRA ticket was open and advertised to all of us on `issues@` 3 months ago, and no one chimed in there.\r\n\r\nI could've created a `dev@` thread to discuss approaches.  And now knowing your preference, maybe I will next time.  But obviously not every JIRA needs a `dev@` thread.  I used my best judgement.  Sometimes the brainstorming and feedback just doesn't appear until there's a 'patch' to stimulate it, so I wrote one 🤷 \r\n\r\nIn any case, I'm happy to discuss/brainstorm the overall approach now.  I think it stands on its own without considering \"inertia\".\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIn short, my thought process was that the more broadly applicable the limit is, the more effective it will be at protecting stability.  It's hard to achieve stability if the safeguards you're relying on are opt-in, \"off\" by default, or only apply to a subset of relevant queries.  So I wanted to make the \"minPrefix\" limit be opt-out, apply broadly, etc.\r\n\r\nSolr already has a query-time limit that fits this \"broadly applicable\" model pretty well, also in service of stability: `maxBooleanClauses`.  mBC has caused its share of issues, but the underlying model is sound and has been a part of Solr for at least a decade.  Users are already familiar with this sort of limit coming in under solrconfig.xml, etc.\r\n\r\nSo that's mostly what I've tried to do in this PR: (1) make it \"broad\" by design, and (2) follow mBC as a model in terms of how to configure, document, and implement.\r\n\r\n@dsmiley - You noted above your preference for something parser-specific.

It's hard to achieve stability if the safeguards you're relying on are opt-in, \"off\" by default, or only apply to a subset of relevant queries. So I wanted to make the \"minPrefix\" limit be opt-out, apply broadly, etc.\r\n\r\nThis runs the real risk of an obscure limit showing itself in production that would hot have been caught in a test setup for a use-case that should absolutely not have such a limit.  Generally \"q\" is provided by a user, uses a more user-facing query parser (namely edismax), and would be a nice place for such a limit.  But otherwise, queries show up in tons of other places for internal use-cases written by systems programmers (i.e. us devs) using the default \"lucene\" query parser where I don't think such a limit at all makes sense (at least not by default).  Random examples -- delete-by-query, facet.query, join query.\r\n\r\nThe same is so for maxBooleanClauses!  I was hoping you wouldn't bring that up but of course you did; it's the precedent for your decision.  That unfortunate precedent caused a huge ugly debate with only one person holding veto power that insisted on maxBooleanClauses as it exists today.  That might have made Yonik leave to do Heliosearch over, if there was a huge straw break that back.  I hope we don't repeat that mistake.  I've only ever increased maxBooleanClauses to something insane, not because there isn't a risk of users doing expensive queries that we want to limit, but instead because the correct (IMO) place to enforce query constraints is at the query parser.  And we do this where I work for various things that in-effect constraint the query complexity.\r\n\r\n@markrmiller you and most others were involved in that ugly debate... what do you think of Jason's approach here?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2155349004/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2155373058","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1895#issuecomment-2155373058","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1895","id":2155373058,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6AeGIC","user":{"login":"magibney","id":6225104,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMjUxMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6225104?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/magibney","html_url":"https://github.com/magibney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magibney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magibney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magibney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magibney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magibney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magibney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magibney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magibney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magibney/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-07T19:08:00Z","updated_at":"2024-06-07T19:08:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"For the record, considering the above question about concurrency constructs:\r\n\r\nI've dug into [SOLR-7113](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-7113), and I'm increasingly convinced that although it's technically correct that `UpdateLog.init(UpdateHandler, SolrCore)` is not thread safe, the issue title (filed with initial report) is misleading in calling attention to \"thread safety\", and the issue fix (in the form of making a portion of the method synchronized on `fsLock` object) is misleading, because afaict `UpdateLog.init(UpdateHandler, SolrCore)` is never called concurrently in application code, nor should it be.\r\n\r\nThe issue with SOLR-7113 was not one of thread safety, so much as one of leaking resources and closing them across different scopes. This issue was effectively fixed by disallowing modification of tlog location across core reloads.\r\n\r\nMy inclination atm is to leave the AtomicBoolean in place -- we need something to shortcircuit repeated init in application code (which does happen, albeit not in a way that needs to be thread safe), and leaving AtomicBoolean is thread-safe against the test that was written for SOLR-7113;

I'm not sure I agree.  System-devs are more likely than the average user to know about Solr's performance pitfalls, but is that safe to assume across the board?  I think our many years with the project put us in danger of overestimating the knowledge and context other users might have, and underestimating the value of safeguards.\r\n\r\nThat's the key issue for me IMO - if I was more comfortable with those generalizations I'd be happy with an edismax fix.

For one, it's terribly calibrated, or at least terribly out of date.  (Is 1024 clauses even a lot on today's hardware?  It seems like nothing!). I'm not here to defend it.  And I can't speak to the old debate without reading up on it.  (Do you have a pointer handy @dsmiley ?)\r\n\r\nBut conceptually I think `maxBooleanClauses` takes the right response to a \"DANGER\" stimulus.  If something has the potential to take down a cluster a global block is the safest thing to do.  It's not ideal, but in the absence of other data to block in a more targeted manner, stability is worth prioritizing.  Solr should be stable by default, even if that means admins have a little extra work to do to \"unlock\" certain query patterns.

I wish everyone (myself included) was so thorough in listing out other potential approaches.  This is awesome!\r\n\r\nUltimately I think the approach you took here is the best one available for now.\r\n\r\nAs you pointed out, it does have the downside that it requires all response classes to live in the same package.  I agree this is non-ideal, but something we can live with.  In fact, there are actually one or other two places where the template relies on the \"single package\" assumption.  I tried hard to avoid it in the initial implementation, but couldn't crack it entirely at the time.  In hindsight I think we could probably do something based on vendor-extension annotations (like the one used in [SelectApi](https://github.com/apache/solr/blob/a42c605fb916439222a086356f368f02cf80304a/solr/api/src/java/org/apache/solr/client/api/endpoint/SelectApi.java#L69-L74)), but that'd require a larger effort than just fixing this bug.\r\n\r\n> It is possible to add a generics bound in JacksonParsingResponse<T> that limits T to only classes that extend SolrJerseyResponse, but this will limit the possible classes for T\r\n\r\nI think this would probably be OK as a longer-term solution.  Though I wonder about a few APIs that return \"blobs\" of data (e.g. returning a single file out of a configset).  These responses are \"just\" raw data, so they don't quite fit into the `SolrJerseyResponse` model which assumes at least a bare minimum of structure (e.g. `responseHeader`).  That feels like a solve-able problem, but it might take some thought...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2159142519/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2159229315","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2438#issuecomment-2159229315","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2438","id":2159229315,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6AszmD","user":{"login":"patsonluk","id":2895902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTU5MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2895902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/patsonluk","html_url":"https://github.com/patsonluk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patsonluk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patsonluk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patsonluk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patsonluk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patsonluk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patsonluk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patsonluk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patsonluk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patsonluk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-10T20:31:01Z","updated_at":"2024-06-10T21:31:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Can a SyntheticSolrCore be prevented from registering itself with CoreContainer? I would imagine so since this functionality is inserted at the HttpSolrCall level thus the SolrCore could come from wherever. It might be less hacky to prevent weird/unusual SolrCores from presenting themselves in the CoreContainer to other functionality (who knows) that is expecting normal cores. I don't have a strong opinion on this; just sharing.\r\n\r\nI think that's a very good question! AFAIK, we probably really only need `SyntheticSolrCore` be present when `CoordinatorHttpSolrCall` is doing its special logic, which means in theory, it does not have to live within the`CoreContainer`/`SolrCores`. And it will be much cleaner w/o that!\r\n\r\nI will investigate a bit and see if there are any dependencies that prevent us from doing that 😊  \r\n\r\n**_Update_**: Did a bit of refactoring, and it's not as clean as I hope it will be - since we still have to rely on `CoreContainer` for loading the core creation (loading configset etc). So the change be - instead of keeping track of the synthetic core in the map in `SolrCores`, do it in some Coordinator specific classes (for example the `CoordinatorHttpSolrCall$Factory`), this is all good but it lacks lifecycle management (basically closing the cores) like `SolrCores`/`CoreContainer`. Therefore, I will keep it as is for now in this PR 😓 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2159229315/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2159312054","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2477#issuecomment-2159312054","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2477","id":2159312054,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6AtHy2","user":{"login":"dsmiley","id":377295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzI5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/377295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley","html_url":"https://github.com/dsmiley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-10T21:26:21Z","updated_at":"2024-06-10T21:26:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Tagging @cpoerschke for review; I figure you're a better reviewer here.

I say perhaps fairly arbitrary because it's difficult to do any better, given varying hardware and data.\n\nThe cost is that is that things that worked fine in testing may start blowing up randomly in production, perhaps needlessly, until you address the situation.\nThorny. Benifit / reward, what lines are drawn where, it's all pretty subjective. So I don't know.\n\nAs a user, I certainly would want to be able to opt in, though yes, that makes the effort likely of little value, particularly if it's opt-in per limit. A universal opt-in would be better but would likely still end up as little value then. As a user, I'll still be pissed when production starts failing things the first time, and I judge it should not be doing that for my case. And at that point, I would be very unhappy if there was not a universal opt-out. Thorny.\n\nI do see the value, but in most cases, that value would not likely be high enough to convince me as a user that this was a good default system practice. Other than for very particular things, it doesn't seem like a common practice in other systems because of how thorny it is.\n\nI think some limits have a bit more clear value, though. Things that can build up over time and then are very difficult to address. Something along the lines of no limit to the number of fields on a document, where things can work fine for the first 6 months, but over time, you are using more and more fields and eventually the system just kind of seizes under the weight, and you can't do much but start over. Maybe hitting something much earlier that said you are using a strangely large number of fields, this is not a very scable approach, you have to change a configuration to continue down this path, would make a lot more sense.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2159688977/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2159696597","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2499#issuecomment-2159696597","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2499","id":2159696597,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6AulrV","user":{"login":"markrmiller","id":448788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODc4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/448788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markrmiller","html_url":"https://github.com/markrmiller","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markrmiller/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markrmiller/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markrmiller/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markrmiller/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markrmiller/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markrmiller/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markrmiller/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markrmiller/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markrmiller/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-11T03:08:54Z","updated_at":"2024-06-11T03:08:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"One use case where opt-in still has a lot of value is when one team runs Solr as a service or for other teams.

The JDK (with IDE support too) and javac already handle it in its own way. ForbiddenAPI principally exists for non-deprecated things we insist on not using. cc @uschindler\r\n\r\nIn Java 11 it is not yet deprecated. So this allows to forbid it now.\r\n\r\nActually once we are on Java 21, the forbiddenapis signatures will complain, too (as deprecated APIs are reported, too). If you ask why forbiddenapis reports deprecated stuff: It's because normally during compilation, JDK only reports a warning for all deprecations (not only in the JDK also in your own code or dependencies). Forbiddenapis allows to restrict only JDK-forbidden stuff and you can keep other deprecations supressed. This is especially important for API developers, because you deprecate your own stuff but still have tests for it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2164786335/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2165044084","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2501#issuecomment-2165044084","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2501","id":2165044084,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6BC_N0","user":{"login":"dsmiley","id":377295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzI5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/377295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley","html_url":"https://github.com/dsmiley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-13T08:55:08Z","updated_at":"2024-06-13T08:55:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"What I love about our community is that we have so much expertise to call upon; thanks Uwe :-)\r\n\r\n> Forbiddenapis allows to restrict only JDK-forbidden stuff\r\n\r\nThen lets do that and not single out a specific thing (URL).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2165044084/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2165858080","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/313#issuecomment-2165858080","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/313","id":2165858080,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6BGF8g","user":{"login":"atris","id":1724131,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjQxMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1724131?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/atris","html_url":"https://github.com/atris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-13T14:34:16Z","updated_at":"2024-06-13T14:34:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Still working on this - have a PR in process.

If you or others think my proposal here has merit, I can try and work up a PR for it so it can be evaluated further.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2166340661/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2166795214","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1768#issuecomment-2166795214","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1768","id":2166795214,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6BJqvO","user":{"login":"epugh","id":22395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh","html_url":"https://github.com/epugh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-13T21:05:46Z","updated_at":"2024-06-13T21:05:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@HoustonPutman any tips on how to validate that changes on this PR don't impact solr operator?

I recognize that introducing a bounded wild card would normally be a breaking change, but in this particular case, the boundary is consistent with the one that `TopDocsCollector` already has in place (and has had since the stone age). All `TopDocsCollectors` are upper bounded to `ScoreDoc`. \r\n```java\r\npublic abstract class TopDocsCollector<T extends ScoreDoc> implements Collector {\r\n```\r\n\r\nGiven that.... it really isn't a breaking change. All previously `RankQuery` classes that worked in Solr 8.x work again after this PR change (at least from an API perspective; implementation might need tweeking). It's actually the same thing at runtime as what the previous raw type had (because of the bounds in the `TopDocsCollector` class). Making it invariant was the change that was breaking.\r\n\r\nBut yeah... take a look at the other commit I made that introduces the type variable into `RankQuery` and see if that addresses your concerns.\r\n\r\nThanks for taking the time to look into it!

He suggested I take one last crack at making the case for across-the-board limiting, as explicitly as possible.  So here it is:\r\n\r\nUltimately my rationale is pretty simple: aggressive prefix queries have the potential to block _all_ traffic if they trigger an OOM.  That's a worst-case-scenario for an administrator. \r\n\r\nThere's pain for administrators either way.  Realizing that some setting has errantly blocked some \"known safe\" queries definitely brings a serious \"annoyance-factor\".  But to put myself in an administrator's shoes, I'd rather deal with that on 10, 20, even 100 clusters than deal with an \"all traffic\" outage at 3am because of a runaway prefix query.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nSo that's my last pitch for across-the-board limiting.  I'll give this a few days to see if it sways anyone; if no one else is convinced enough to chime in or reverse course though I'll go forward with something like the more limited approach that David championed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2176194711/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2176355611","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/332#issuecomment-2176355611","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/332","id":2176355611,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6BuI0b","user":{"login":"HoustonPutman","id":3376422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzY0MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3376422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman","html_url":"https://github.com/HoustonPutman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-18T15:14:29Z","updated_at":"2024-06-18T15:14:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tom35803 Jan was the one who commented 3 days before.
