Something in your install steps probably does not have the right value.  I know these steps have worked for others, but without knowing the value in these environment variables it is hard for me to tell what could be wrong.  I have created a commit on one of my openwhisk branches that will use ansible to install the alarms feed action and start the alarms provider for you.

So it's possible that if `logging.emit` method called from this class is updated to include these infos, then `PrintStreamLogging` would format a String message to be printed in the console, while  a new `ZipkinLogging` implementation would send a Span.  In this case `createMessageWithMarker` method would move inside `PrintStreamLogging` impl. @rabbah feel free to keep me honest.  The remaining problem is how to generate child spans for invoker, DB ops, docker, etc. \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/300641757/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/300657249","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/2192#issuecomment-300657249","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/2192","id":300657249,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMDY1NzI0OQ==","user":{"login":"style95","id":3447251,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDcyNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3447251?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95","html_url":"https://github.com/style95","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-11T01:30:09Z","updated_at":"2017-05-11T01:30:30Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@rabbah JFYI, many tracing systems provide rich UI with additional information such as JVM heap size, PermGen, cpu usage and so on.\r\n\r\nSince these all information including tracing the transaction could be seen altogether, it would be easy to find the problem and what happens in the system at that time and so on.\r\n\r\nAs @adriancole shared, with logs also we can populate tracing information.\r\n(That`s cool slide, I got clear view in terms of logs, metrics and tracing❤️  )\r\n\r\nGenerally there might be not a big difference, if we manually deploy the system which collects all the logs, a few required metrics, and create a combined view with them altogether.\r\n(Though we have to cross many huddles such as timing issue among distributed servers, etc)\r\n\r\n\r\nJFYI, following screen shots are what pinpoint provides.\r\n\r\n1.

@markusthoemmes @csantanapr \r\nI updated the logic.\r\nNow there is no retry logic on 503 service unavailable.\r\n\r\nLet me explain previous problem first.\r\n\r\nIt was a kind of timing issue. When test codes send `syncPost(ip, 8080, \"/init\", value)`, there is a possibility that target action container is not ready yet. In this case, proxy server will get connection failed(`No route to host`), and accordingly proxy returns `503 service unavailable`.\r\n\r\nI found the [way to configure squid](http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/connect_retries/) to retry when connection attempts fails with \"No route to host\".\r\nIt will retry for some time(it is configurable) in case of connection failure until the action container is ready.\r\n\r\nNow every tests worked as expected except only once test case.\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\nactionContainers.DockerExampleContainerTests > bad containers should timeout bad proxy with exception FAILED\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nDifference on this test is as follow:\r\n\r\nThis test run `badproxy` container and try to send `/init` request to it.\r\nSince `badproxy` does not expose any port, squid proxy server get `Connection refused` instead of `No route to host`. And in this case, squid proxy returns with `503 service unavailable` immediately.\r\n\r\nI think, squid proxy is supposed to retry on both the cases.\r\nI opened an issue at the squid repo: https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/issues/23\r\n\r\nAnyway, if this is resolved, I think it will finally make it.\r\nIn the meantime, please review the code again.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/302031999/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/302033344","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/2248#issuecomment-302033344","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/2248","id":302033344,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMjAzMzM0NA==","user":{"login":"style95","id":3447251,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDcyNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3447251?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95","html_url":"https://github.com/style95","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-17T09:15:08Z","updated_at":"2017-05-17T09:15:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Travis tests have passed","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/302033344/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/302039257","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/1998#issuecomment-302039257","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/1998","id":302039257,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMjAzOTI1Nw==","user":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-17T09:38:25Z","updated_at":"2017-05-17T09:39:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"looks good. \r\n\r\nThanks @markusthoemmes for the pg.
