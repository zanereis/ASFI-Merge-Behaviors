@bhaisaab In about two weeks (Dec 7) we freeze for 4.7.0. That would be a nice time to look back and see if the systemvm template needs to be bumped or not. Right now, there is no PR merged yet that requires a new version, so I don't want to bump it now. It's just too damn annoying upgrading all systemvms if there is no reason. Once there is, we will bump it of course. \n\nLet me add it to the release procedure, to check at freeze time whether the systemvm version needs to be bumped. We will most likely have releases coming where we don't need to bump the version.\n\nAlso @pdion891 could you please squash the commits.
