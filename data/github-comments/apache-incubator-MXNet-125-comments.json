here is the case.  The shape infer comes with an order of forward then backward\n- In the testcase I showed, in the forward case of `wt = w + wshift`, we know wshift is `(1,)`.\n  - The legacy rule will directly assign w.shape to (1, ) , since it is forward pass and the shape of output is not yet known.\n  - This prevents future inference to correct the fact that w should not be (1,)\n\nThat is why for broadcast binary op such shape inference rule is over optimistic. The current change relax the rule, to not set the shape unless it is known to be correct for 100%.\n\nThis prevent shape inference for your case, when shape of b is not given, but can be amended by either use ewise_plus instead, or add an identity_with_attr_like constraint.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/258488640/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/258490254","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/3719#issuecomment-258490254","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/3719","id":258490254,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1ODQ5MDI1NA==","user":{"login":"piiswrong","id":568948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODk0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong","html_url":"https://github.com/piiswrong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-04T17:06:46Z","updated_at":"2016-11-04T17:06:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"try\n`python tests/python/gpu/test_operator_gpu.py`\n\nnosetests wasn't working correctly.
