No, the rest of the code does not handle a CannotProvideCoderException.\r\n\r\nI had thought based on my notes/discussion at the time when I created the JIRA issue that this was basically a documentation issue and that from a logical perspective it'd be okay to let coder inference happen later, but adding \"throws CannotProviderCoderException\" to source's getDefaultOutputCoder shows a couple holes. I'm guessing this is one of those changes where the changes will ripple out a bit (eg https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/java/core/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/Read.java#L108 and https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/runners/core-construction-java/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/runners/core/construction/UnboundedReadFromBoundedSource.java#L179 - that second one makes it seem like we're just moving the \"I need a coder registry\" problem to a different location.)\r\n\r\nI can definitely do the investigation/wiring/testing work if people think this is useful, relevant now and there aren't any known traps out there for me to find. It seems like for adapter sources like the HIFIO, being able to say that you don't know the coder beforehand and instead rely on coder inference would be very handy. The work to make https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/java/io/hadoop/input-format/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/hadoop/inputformat/HadoopInputFormatIO.java#L350 work  involved passing in a coder registry to the source from the outer transform, which felt dirty. It'd be nice to just check to see if there is a known coder, and throw CannotProvideCoderException if that's not the case. \r\n\r\nIf we don't want to do this work, it may be nice to instead do the work to provide the coder registry to sources in a straightforward way.\r\n\r\ncc @kennknowles since I know he cares about this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/294634428/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/294634810","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/2546#issuecomment-294634810","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/2546","id":294634810,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NDYzNDgxMA==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-18T00:26:02Z","updated_at":"2017-04-18T00:26:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\n[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/builds/11118730/badge)](https://coveralls.io/builds/11118730)\n\nCoverage increased (+0.2%) to 70.658% when pulling **f245672d187122c5bba212dbc09c25e5de319fdf on ssisk:enforcer-j7** into **fdbadfc9cceecf645f2325777ab32f1cb3041953 on apache:master**.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/294634810/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/294637902","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/2546#issuecomment-294637902","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/2546","id":294637902,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NDYzNzkwMg==","user":{"login":"dhalperi","id":526415,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNjQxNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/526415?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi","html_url":"https://github.com/dhalperi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-18T00:41:25Z","updated_at":"2017-04-18T00:41:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM, merged.\r\n\r\nThanks!
