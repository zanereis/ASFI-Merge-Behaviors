To not mess with the classpath, you can simply generate an empty class using ASM and write it to a jar (shouldn't be too complicate to use `ClassWriter` to do so, probably about 20 lines of code).

Here it is, cleaned up for what I actually did:\r\n\r\n* Each runnable can have a configured number of max retries.  If not set, then retries are unlimited as before.  Retries are scaled according to the number of instances for each Runnable.\r\n* add withMaxTries(runnableName, int) to TwillPreparer\r\n* add withMaxTries(runnableName, int) to YarnTwillPreparer.  This stores a map from runnableName to maxRetries.\r\n* this map becomes part of the twillRuntimeSpecification and RuntimeSpecification interface and is added to TwillRuntimeSpecificationCodec\r\n* ApplicationMasterService.initRunningContainers is updated to pass a map of runnables to maxretries.\r\n* updated RunningContainers so that it keeps count of the number of retries per runnable and uses this in handleCompleted() to determine if it should retry. Since every instance is the same as any other, if I'm starting 10 instances of a Runnable, and wanted a max retry count of 3, then that would scale the total number of retries to 30. Each instance gets (on average) 3 tries. Since the instances are interchangeable, there is no concept of a discrete instance being retried.\r\n* updated logging to not have anything special if max wasn't set and to log the number of retries left and when they have been exhausted.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/twill/issues/comments/273824662/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/twill/issues/comments/273949052","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/twill/pull/25#issuecomment-273949052","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/twill/issues/25","id":273949052,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3Mzk0OTA1Mg==","user":{"login":"chtyim","id":885032,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NTAzMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/885032?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chtyim","html_url":"https://github.com/chtyim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chtyim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chtyim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chtyim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chtyim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chtyim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chtyim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chtyim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chtyim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chtyim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-20T01:13:21Z","updated_at":"2017-01-20T01:13:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"LGTM","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/twill/issues/comments/273949052/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/twill/issues/comments/274969323","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/twill/pull/23#issuecomment-274969323","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/twill/issues/23","id":274969323,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NDk2OTMyMw==","user":{"login":"serranom","id":4674101,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NzQxMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4674101?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/serranom","html_url":"https://github.com/serranom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serranom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serranom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serranom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serranom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serranom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serranom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serranom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serranom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serranom/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-24T23:10:15Z","updated_at":"2017-01-24T23:16:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"A couple of questions, since it has been a week since this pull request was submitted.
