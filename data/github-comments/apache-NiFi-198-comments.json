However, given the number of times that this method will be called, it would be better to define a local static list of supported properties and return that reference in `getSupportedPropertyDescriptors()`. That does require manual maintenance of the list for the YAML Reader, but that is probably better in this case as it should force a review of whether any new property would apply to both the JSON and YAML implementations.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1764530205/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1764574517","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/7665#issuecomment-1764574517","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/7665","id":1764574517,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5pLUU1","user":{"login":"dan-s1","id":8440116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NDAxMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8440116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1","html_url":"https://github.com/dan-s1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-16T14:13:39Z","updated_at":"2023-10-16T14:13:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@exceptionfactory The problem with static is I need many of the properties which are defined in instance methods in `SchemaRegistryService`.

But looking at what's happening here, the processor does not split Parquet at all. Instead, it clones the input and adds 'count' and 'offset' types of attributes. So the naming is problematic. If I sent in a 10 GB Parquet file to SplitParquet and I get out 10 FlowFiles, I expect each to be 1 GB. Here, each one will be 10 GB because it's a clone of the original. This would lead to a lot confusion.\r\nPerhaps a name like 'CalculateParquetOffsets' is appropriate?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1768506240/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1768510078","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/7591#issuecomment-1768510078","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/7591","id":1768510078,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5paVJ-","user":{"login":"markobean","id":16822728,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODIyNzI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16822728?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean","html_url":"https://github.com/markobean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-18T13:52:31Z","updated_at":"2023-10-18T13:52:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mtien-apache, @exceptionfactory, @mcgilman \r\n\r\nPing.

You could also give it a try with 'Zero Content Output\" setup.\r\n* To determine how many records are in the Parquet file,  CalculateParquetOffsets needs to read some parts of the file, for which it uses the same library as ParquetReader does. I'm not sure how this library determines the record count, but maybe it scans the whole file and counts them. But, if your input FlowFile has a 'record.count' attribute, then this step is skipped. Give it a try, I'd expect the whole process faster.\r\n* ParquetReader uses RecordFilter to 'jump' to the wanted record. But as this is a general concept in the library we use, this means that the whole file is scanned through, and RecordFilter is evaluated to each of the records. Unfortunately, there is no concept like 'Jump to a record index'. Although I have an optimization idea of stop reading the records after we have read the desired number of records. RecordFilter then would be used only to find the first record to be read. I'll add a new commit soon with this improvement.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1772142723/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1772304134","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/7893#issuecomment-1772304134","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/7893","id":1772304134,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5pozcG","user":{"login":"pvillard31","id":11541012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTQxMDEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11541012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31","html_url":"https://github.com/pvillard31","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-20T08:28:20Z","updated_at":"2023-10-20T08:28:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The CalculateParquetOffsets step is taking less than 1 millisecond to complete: the 50 clones are not copying the data, they get the same reference to actual claim (where the data is stored in the content repo).\r\n\r\nSo I think it's really around the ParquetReader and how we can \"jump\" to the right location as you said.

But my question is why is there duplicate code between the two processors? This MR and NIFI-11959 (#7678) are consequences of duplicate code (i.e. the need to make the same fix in both places). Is there something we can do here to refactor and extract the duplicate code to be shared with these two classes?\r\n\r\n@dan-s1 absolutely, I was thinking similar when I made the comment about the `*Record` processor in this PR, although I didn't think it was worth extending this PR to cover such a refactor. Could you raise a separate Jira ticket to refactor these processors to merge the logic where possible, e.g. the `PropertyDescriptor`s and such, at the very least, could be merged together.\r\n\r\nIt would be good to explore whether things such as the custom UI available in the `JoltTransformJSON` could be merged together with `JoltTransformRecord` in the future, plus the handling of JOLT logic where possible. I'm not overly familiar with these processor, but without spending much time looking at the code, I'd hope that the only real difference *should* be whether the processor is applying the transform to the entire FlowFile content (i.e. in the `*JSON` processor) or every Record within (e.g. JSON Object within an Array, or every line of an ndjson/jsonl/json-ld file) - once the appropriate content has been read into memory, presumably the same JOLT transformation logic should be executed, then the result serialised either directly as the FlowFile's content (i.e. for `*JSON`) or via the configured `Record Set Writer` (i.e. for `*Record`).\r\n\r\nI've tried to do a similar thing for the `PutElastisearch*` processors previously (i.e. `*JSON` and `*Record`), which both extend an `AbstractPutElasticsearch` base in an attempt to minimise repetition and avoid maintenance problems/inconsistent behaviour between the processors.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1775663229/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1775879122","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6918#issuecomment-1775879122","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/6918","id":1775879122,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5p2cPS","user":{"login":"sebastianrothbucher","id":7339874,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMzk4NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7339874?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianrothbucher","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastianrothbucher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianrothbucher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianrothbucher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianrothbucher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianrothbucher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianrothbucher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianrothbucher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianrothbucher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianrothbucher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastianrothbucher/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-23T19:23:55Z","updated_at":"2023-10-23T19:23:55Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks!

But that said, I suspect that building and running the Docker Images with `colima` (or any tool other than `docker`) is probably relatively rare / not something we're looking to directly support here\r\n\r\nSo I think it probably comes down to whether we think there is sufficient benefit in (more regularly) running the extended tests in the (assumed) more common development environment","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1775897351/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1775930468","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/7920#issuecomment-1775930468","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/7920","id":1775930468,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5p2oxk","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-23T20:01:06Z","updated_at":"2023-10-23T20:01:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the thoughtful reply @ChrisSamo632. Those are definitely points worth considering as far as Colima versus standard Docker.\r\n\r\nI have been in touch with Apache Infrastructure support about testing their new hosted GitHub Runners, which will hopefully provide some performance improvements. However, I'm not sure about the operating systems supported, so that may be limiting.\r\n\r\nWith that background, and considering the resources used, I think it would be better to keep the Docker and Integration Test workflows limited to one OS (Linux). Although it might not cover every possible situation, it is much better than no coverage.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about re-scoping this pull request to removing the matrix configuration and just targeting the one OS?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1775930468/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1775941691","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/7665#issuecomment-1775941691","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/7665","id":1775941691,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5p2rg7","user":{"login":"dan-s1","id":8440116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NDAxMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8440116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1","html_url":"https://github.com/dan-s1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-23T20:09:03Z","updated_at":"2023-10-23T20:09:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@exceptionfactory Thank you!

Using FlowFile attributes can be helpful where there are well known status properties, such as HTTP response codes.\r\n\r\nSFTP has some error codes, but even communication failures are different than other issues, like file not found or permission denied.
