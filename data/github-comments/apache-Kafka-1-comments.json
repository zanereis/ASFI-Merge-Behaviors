The original patch fixed these by removing two calls in `KafkaServer.registerStats`. That change would mean that the metrics would not be registered during start-up anymore. They would, instead, be registered on first access to `ControllerStats`. Is this acceptable? Since I wasn't sure, I removed that change from this PR. I think changing that code should probably be done as part of a separate issue as it may involve some refactoring (the way metrics registration happens as a side-effect of triggering object initialisation is not great, in my opinion).\n\nThe other warnings are related to deprecations and should also be tackled separately.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/96790510/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/96819306","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/46#issuecomment-96819306","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/46","id":96819306,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk2ODE5MzA2","user":{"login":"rekhajoshm","id":5987836,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5ODc4MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5987836?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rekhajoshm","html_url":"https://github.com/rekhajoshm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rekhajoshm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rekhajoshm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rekhajoshm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rekhajoshm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rekhajoshm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rekhajoshm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rekhajoshm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rekhajoshm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rekhajoshm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-27T21:03:45Z","updated_at":"2015-04-27T21:03:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @nehanarkhede Applied your review comments at #58 Closing this.Thanks\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/96819306/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/96897514","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/57#issuecomment-96897514","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/57","id":96897514,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk2ODk3NTE0","user":{"login":"nehanarkhede","id":209573,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTU3Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/209573?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nehanarkhede","html_url":"https://github.com/nehanarkhede","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nehanarkhede/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nehanarkhede/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nehanarkhede/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nehanarkhede/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nehanarkhede/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nehanarkhede/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nehanarkhede/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nehanarkhede/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nehanarkhede/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-28T03:33:48Z","updated_at":"2015-04-28T03:33:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"bq.

(https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Roadmap+-+port+existing+system+tests) It also has updates to Vagrant necessary for running the tests on a Vagrant cluster.\n\nKafka codebase:\n- New tool called VerifiableProducer which writes metadata about produce requests to stdout\n- corresponding update to build.gradle\n- Other small refactorings\n\nVagrant:\n- Updates to Vagrantfile and some examples of Vagrantfile.local which are necessary for running the tests with ducktape\n\ntests/ directory:\n- This contains the python code which makes up the actual sample system tests as well as a few core Service classes (e.g. Zookeeper, Kafka, ConsoleConsumer
