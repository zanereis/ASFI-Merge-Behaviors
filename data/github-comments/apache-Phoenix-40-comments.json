Clients can use salting to reduce the hotpostitng but then it is upto clients that how they want to manage all aspects of it. HBase doesn't care about salting in case of split or merge.\r\n\r\nIn phoenix we have this limitation that every row in a single region should have same salt. If we mix(merge) two regions of different salts phoenix scans starting behaving weird.
