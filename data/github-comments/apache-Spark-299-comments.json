Thank you for working on it.\n\nI have three general comments.\n1. Hive has a lots of confs that are used to influence how semantic analyzer works. `HiveConf.ConfVars.DYNAMICPARTITIONING (hive.exec.dynamic.partition)` and `HiveConf.ConfVars.DYNAMICPARTITIONINGMODE (hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode)` are two examples. As long as we generate the correct results and we can make sure the execution is robust, I think it is not necessarily to follow those confs.\n2. For `hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode`, I think the purpose of it is to avoid having too many concurrent file writers in a task. Actually, even if `hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode=strict`, we can still have many distinct values on those dynamic partitioning columns and thus, have too many file writers in a task. For those columnar file formats, like RCFile, ORC, and Parquet, every file writer internally maintain a memory buffer. Many file writers can significantly increase the memory footprint of a task and can introduce OOMs. Instead of relying on Hive's confs, it is better to provide a way to group data based on those dynamic partitioning columns. So, we will not have many concurrent file writers. Just two primitive ideas. We can shuffle the data before inserting. Or, we can do local grouping and write data in a group-by-group fashion. Anyway, I feel we may need to introduce changes to the planner. \n3. The last comment is not quite related to this PR. I think it is better to have a general design on how table is partitioned and (hopefully,) Hive's directory layout in HDFS will be just a special case. I am not sure that creating a single file for every combination of values of partitioning columns is a good way. It introduces potential stability issues to the insert operation (too many file writers), and performance issues to both insert and table scan operations. With this approach, we can easily create a lots of small files in HDFS, which introduces memory pressure to the HDFS namenode.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/52509183/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/52509222","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1269#issuecomment-52509222","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1269","id":52509222,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNTA5MjIy","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-18T15:34:32Z","updated_at":"2014-08-18T15:34:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"  [QA tests have finished](https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/SparkPullRequestBuilder/18751/consoleFull) for   PR 1269 at commit [`d480c6e`](https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/d480c6e896488cfb733d5bcb706e8b5f8278f35b).\n- This patch **passes** unit tests.\n- This patch merges cleanly.\n- This patch adds the following public classes _(experimental)_:\n  -
