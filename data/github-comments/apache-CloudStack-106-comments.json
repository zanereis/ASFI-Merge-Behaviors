Construct the condition per hypervisor documentation and simply fail it with information/documentation references, if required. \n\nAlso leaving it to hypervisor may be costlier, this being, storage migration task, is an async job which increase async job count to be tracked/managed by management server and also may involve multiple hypervisor API calls, even for failure cases. It's good to reduce the jobs and API calls if the outcome is known definitively in advance. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/212845624/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/212852849","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1489#issuecomment-212852849","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1489","id":212852849,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMjg1Mjg0OQ==","user":{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-21T10:49:06Z","updated_at":"2016-04-21T10:49:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@jburwell I've fixed outstanding issues, including a framework level API arg validation (and removed such validations across cmd implementations)\n@koushik-das let me know if you've more questions\n\nThanks all for the review, I believe all of the outstanding issues have been solved and fixed. /cc @swill \n\nI've executed another test round locally and it looks good to me \n==== Marvin Init Started ====\n\n=== Marvin Parse Config Successful ===\n\n=== Marvin Setting TestData Successful===\n\n==== Log Folder Path: /tmp//MarvinLogs//Apr_21_2016_16_16_18_FM3SK5.

Lets just reference this PR in the new PR so we remember to count his vote.  :)\n\nBasically how this works is as follows:\n- The current release is 4.8.  \n- We support fixes in one release prior the the current release, and those fixes are put against the main branch, so in this case 4.7.  I am not sure of the release cycle on this branch, but at some point a newer minor release may be cut from this branch (something like 4.7.2 for example).\n- Whenever a fix is made in a previous release, the fix is then forward merged into the later releases.  This is so the commit hash is consistent between all branches making it easier to understand if a specific fix is in a specific branch.  So if a commit is added to the 4.7 branch, it will be forward merged to the 4.8 branch, and then forward merged again to master.\n- We treat master as the next release and add new features there and make sure everything is stable for the next release (in this case 4.9).\n\nDoes that all make sense?  Don't be shy if you have questions.  I will do my best to support you.

W=\ne ran across this issue in our environment as well (CentOS 7 with KVM) with=\n CS 4.7.0.  The problem appeared to use as a behavior of libvirt because we=\n could reproduce the error independent of CS by manually creating a VM and =\nmigrating it outside of CS but on the CS host.  This led us to believe it w=\nas a libvirt issue.  However, based on the code change in the Git repositor=\ny I was unaware there were hooks into libvirt.\n\nWe worked around the issue by just changing the name of the bridge from brv=\nx-1234 to vxbr-1234 and that resolved the issue for us.
