Is there any problem with consul's health check?\r\n> \r\n> It is TCP check provided by consul, see more from https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/checks.html\r\n> \r\n> It looks like consul uses short TCP connection to check node's liveness, which in fact is reasonable. I think we should bear with the disconnection logging messages since we allow user to adjust check interval like this:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n>     <dubbo:registry address=\"consul://localhost:8500\">\r\n>         <dubbo:parameter key=\"consul-check-interval\" value=\"60s\"/>\r\n>         <dubbo:parameter key=\"consul-check-timeout\" value=\"20s\"/>\r\n>     </dubbo:registry>\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> What do you think?\r\n\r\nAgree. How about increase the default check interval, say 60s, current interval is to some extent too frequent.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/470865076/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/470865786","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/3621#issuecomment-470865786","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3621","id":470865786,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MDg2NTc4Ng==","user":{"login":"ralf0131","id":4397305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTczMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4397305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131","html_url":"https://github.com/ralf0131","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-08T09:36:33Z","updated_at":"2019-03-08T09:36:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It

all Config into builders.\r\n\r\nIMO, fluent api is just for users, we can make code like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nAbstractReferenceConfig {\r\n\t\r\n    protected Boolean check = true;\r\n\r\n    public

In your scenario, duplicate code is placed in the builder. For example, the `setCheck` code appears in the builder and origin config. In my scenario, `setCheck` is still repeated in builder. Since neither can solve the problem of duplicate code, we can try to reduce the number of classes. \r\n:)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/471419492/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/471420274","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/pull/3549#issuecomment-471420274","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3549","id":471420274,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MTQyMDI3NA==","user":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-11T06:34:14Z","updated_at":"2019-03-11T06:34:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Do you all think this PR has been ready to be released in 2.7.1?

谢谢你的建议.\r\n\r\n大家在看这个 PR 前建议先看下 PR #2956 , 那里分析了出现issue #619 的原因.\r\n\r\nPR #2956 那样改在社区版里看上去是没有问题的, 但是在某些情况下会有问题:\r\n\r\n比如我们公司在FailoverClusterInvoker.doInvoke()里加了全链路监控埋点的代码, 如下所示:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11908486/54118472-0daaea00-442e-11e9-9533-3517670d4814.png)\r\n\r\n在finally块里, 我们会取详细的exception异常栈(如果有的话), 然后记录在链路日志中, 用的如下这段:\r\n`info.setExceptionStr(ExceptionUtils.getStackTrace(result.getException()));`\r\n\r\n在执行这段代码之前, result.getException()里的stackTrace是null, 这没有问题, 因为服务端本来就抛出了没有异常栈的NullPointerException, (如果这里不懂的话, 建议先看一下 #2956 , 那里有详细的分析).\r\n\r\n但是执行完这段代码后, 见如下截图:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11908486/54118802-da1c8f80-442e-11e9-9d7c-6221d681b0e1.png)\r\n\r\nstackTrace 就变成了错误的异常栈, 也就是 issue #619 中出现那个误导用户的异常栈, 之所以在PR #2956 后还是有这个问题, 是因为是先执行的上面那块代码, 然后再执行RpcResult.recreate(), 而PR #2956 是在recreate里做的修改, 其实应该是在DecodeableRpcResult 类的handleException()方法里做异常栈的判断和修改:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11908486/54119315-fd940a00-442f-11e9-9d55-a8786d91f279.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11908486/54119342-0d135300-4430-11e9-9fdc-220d784f88a3.png)\r\n\r\n本 PR 的目的是优化 PR #2956 , 在decode时就实现异常栈的检测和修改, 而不是等到InvokerInvocationHandler.invoke()后, recreate()时再做检测, 否则如果用户做二次开发时, 在诸如FailoverClusterInvoker.doInvoke()里用类似ExceptionUtils.getStackTrace()方法就破坏了异常栈, 所以要在源头就做好检测和修改, 这样更好一点.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/471496535/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/471626357","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/3620#issuecomment-471626357","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3620","id":471626357,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MTYyNjM1Nw==","user":{"login":"tswstarplanet","id":3047563,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDc1NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3047563?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet","html_url":"https://github.com/tswstarplanet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-11T16:55:34Z","updated_at":"2019-03-11T16:55:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Can

do have some ideas after reviewing the source code of `ServiceConfig`.\r\n\r\nFirst, the existing implementation by using two variables for controlling `ServiceConfig` exporting state is not only awkward to code, but also can theoretically lead invalid state transitions (`exported` and `export` both simultaneously true or false).\r\n\r\nSecondly, the `exported` is set in `doExport()` method which could be called asynchronously, this makes it hard to refactor to prevent duplication exporting. \r\n\r\nOkay, there's not \"last but not least\".\r\n\r\nI'll suggest to introduce the following changes:\r\n\r\n1. refactor the two variables aforementioned into one `AtomicInteger` variable.\r\n2. `compare and set` exporting state in `export()` and `unexport()` methods **before doing anything**.\r\n3. it's obviously to see that we can now safely remove the `synchronized` from the two methods.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/471823806/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/471826607","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/3163#issuecomment-471826607","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3163","id":471826607,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MTgyNjYwNw==","user":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-12T02:32:16Z","updated_at":"2019-03-12T02:32:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":">
