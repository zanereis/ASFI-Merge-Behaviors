@zhangyue19921010 : you are bringing up a good point. if I am not wrong, you are talking about a scenario, where someone triggered delete_partition for partition X and later added new data to the same

partition is not yet synced to metadata table. t15: add new data to partition X which gets synced to Metadata table right away. t20: async cleaner completes and deletes partition X. which gets synced to metadata table and deletes partition X.\r\n> \r\n> Or were you talking about some other scenario ?\r\n\r\nYes, it is.

I also tired if we can pass the `schema` to `#preCombine` method, just similar with `#combineAndGetUpdateValue`. But we only can get the schema info from flink configuration, the `FlinkWriteHelper` doesn't(and should not) support flink configuration to support retrieve schema from configuration, so I have to inject schema via constructor.

localhost(127.0.0.1)`.\r\n\r\nThis PR is just to upgrade the Protocbuf from 3.1 to 3.11.\r\n\r\nIs there any simple unitest  case for it instead of this complicated demo for the new comer ? \r\nOr could you guys as the Hudi veteran help to verify it on x86 first for the release 0.11? Thanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1034692908/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1034695391","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/4753#issuecomment-1034695391","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/4753","id":1034695391,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM49rDLf","user":{"login":"zhangyue19921010","id":69956021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5OTU2MDIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69956021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010","html_url":"https://github.com/zhangyue19921010","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-10T09:35:29Z","updated_at":"2022-02-10T09:35:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @xiarixiaoyao and @alexeykudinkin  All comments are addressed and CI job passed.
