MySQL 5.6, `COMPACT` is the default row format. After MySQL 5.7 (include 8.0), `DYNAMIC` is the default row format. The two are the most popular row formats.  \r\n\r\nFor `COMPRESSED`, it is not supported yet. Users who cares about storage size rather than CPU load might choose this format. But IMHO, most MySQL users do not specify row format when creating table.\r\n\r\nFor `FIXED` row format, it is rarely used. Refer to https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/create-table.html\r\n```\r\nROW_FORMAT=FIXED is not supported. If ROW_FORMAT=FIXED is specified while innodb_strict_mode is disabled, InnoDB issues a warning and assumes ROW_FORMAT=DYNAMIC. If ROW_FORMAT=FIXED is specified while innodb_strict_mode is enabled, which is the default, InnoDB returns an error.\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor `REDUNDANT` row format, it is an very old format before MySQL 5.1. \r\n\r\nFor `extra`, there is no such row format. Valid row formats are {DEFAULT | DYNAMIC | FIXED | COMPRESSED | REDUNDANT | COMPACT}\r\n\r\nTo conclude, the adapter supports `COMPACT` and `DYNAMIC` format which are most commonly used nowadays. I can add explanations in `Limitation` section.

Query by offloading mysql-server process, even without mysql-server running. Backup MySQL without disturbing mysql-server process, this is a good alternative to dump data besides mysql-dump and `mysql -e` command.\r\n2. InnoDB data file can be distributed to other storage. Based on this adapter, users can transform as what ever they wanted, for example, transforming data to columnar format (ORC, Parquet) for OLAP engines; dumping data to heterogeneous NewSQL systems, so that Data Lake analytics can leverage this. Although real-time is hard to achieve because we only get a snapshot of the table, it is still useful in Lambda architecture.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/652330139/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/652379106","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/1944#issuecomment-652379106","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/1944","id":652379106,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1MjM3OTEwNg==","user":{"login":"zinking","id":118241,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODI0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/118241?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zinking","html_url":"https://github.com/zinking","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zinking/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zinking/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zinking/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zinking/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zinking/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zinking/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zinking/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zinking/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zinking/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-01T12:06:37Z","updated_at":"2020-07-01T12:06:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> > I don't see interface definition needs to be changed, the change should be made in the IMPlementation file.\r\n> \r\n> @zinking Thanks for your good suggestion.

more thoughts and discussions, we have changed the design in another way:\r\n\r\n1. The `RelOptCost` interface is left unchanged. \r\n2. Add an abstract class that implements the `RelOptCost` interface. Concrete cost classes are supposed to extend this class. \r\n3. The new method with concentrated comparison logic (`compareCost`) is declared in the abstract class as an abstract method.\r\n4. The concrete comparison methods `isLt`, `isLe` and `equals` methods are implemented in the abstract class as final methods. \r\n\r\nBenefits of this implementation:\r\n1.

Thanks a lot for your feedback. Below are some explanations:\r\n\r\n1. We extract a common method for ImmutableBitSet, which is repeated multiple times in the code base. We also find it useful in our code base. This makes the code simpler and easier to maintain. \r\n2. In Aggregate#getRollup, we replace the LinkedHashSet with an ArrayList, because we can make sure that the newly added element must be distinct (according to the definition of a rollup). This makes adding data faster (LinkedHashSet takes O(logn) time, whereas ArrayList takes O(1)).\r\n3. When checking if a group set is a roll up, we replace the except operation with cardinality minus, which is much faster. We can make this optimization, because when a set contains another, the cardinality of the difference is the difference of the cardiality.\r\n4. In Util#firstDuplicate method, we replace the HashMap with a HashSet, because the value in the HashMap is not really used. This makes the logic clearer. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/653371215/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/653739736","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/2056#issuecomment-653739736","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/2056","id":653739736,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1MzczOTczNg==","user":{"login":"Aaaaaaron","id":15643702,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjQzNzAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15643702?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aaaaaaron","html_url":"https://github.com/Aaaaaaron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aaaaaaron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aaaaaaron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aaaaaaron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aaaaaaron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aaaaaaron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aaaaaaron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aaaaaaron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aaaaaaron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aaaaaaron/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-04T08:41:32Z","updated_at":"2020-07-07T03:26:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hard to add UT.\r\n\"testInOperation/testNotInOperation\" is end to end test. \r\n\r\nWhen you debug, you can find `inOperationCoercion` return false, but the tests can still pass cuz `ComparableOperandTypeChecker#checkOperandTypes` passes, and the casted expr has been updated.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15643702/86508808-86993680-be15-11ea-8721-4fd8c43b0b9f.png)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/653739736/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/654137045","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/2037#issuecomment-654137045","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/2037","id":654137045,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1NDEzNzA0NQ==","user":{"login":"rubenada","id":19411329,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDExMzI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19411329?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenada","html_url":"https://github.com/rubenada","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenada/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenada/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenada/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenada/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenada/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenada/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenada/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenada/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenada/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-06T09:58:02Z","updated_at":"2020-07-06T09:58:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@hsyuan gentle reminder.
