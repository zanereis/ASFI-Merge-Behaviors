Would the plan be to add querying methods to the `db_engine_spec`? This way we could have more control over the details later.\r\n\r\nWith regards to the details on Oracle/Snowflake case logic, I think this hack works fine for now, at least much better than if left untouched. Reading the docs both Oracle and Snowflake return case insensitive column names as uppercase (I'm assuming the docs refer to cursor.description), but if an uppercase column name is sent to SQLAlchemy, it treats that as case sensitive, and encloses the column name in quotes, resulting in the problem that we've observed. I can't come up with a scenario where this fix/hack would break anything, as any query that was previously working was already case insensitive, hence would be unaffected by lowercasing the column names (at least that's my interpretation).\r\n\r\nI've actually raised the `cursor.description` vs `resultproxy.keys()` inconsistency with Snowflake and hope to get some help from them on that front, either guidance on how to use the connector or a change to it's behaviour/room for customisation of engine_params in future versions. The details surrounding the Oracle connector aren't as familiar to me, but can look into that in the coming days. At any rate, the current problem stems from mixing cursor with connection, so this problem should ultimately go away if all db connectivity is streamlined.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/388640951/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/388645586","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/4964#issuecomment-388645586","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/4964","id":388645586,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4ODY0NTU4Ng==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-13T18:15:13Z","updated_at":"2018-05-13T18:15:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"It
