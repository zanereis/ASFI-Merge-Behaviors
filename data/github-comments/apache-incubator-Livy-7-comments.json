I took a very quick look at some of the most top docker images:\r\n\r\n* by environment variable (like mysql),\r\n* by mounting a config file (like nginx and httpd -- which also require mounting content to be useful!),\r\n* by building a new docker image containing your customized config file and/or content (almost all of them, but not the flexibility we're looking for),\r\n* by providing the config on the command line when you run the image (redis, memcached have examples).\r\n\r\nThe list isn't exclusive -- the image author can pick and choose one or more.  I'm intrigued by nginx, which optionally provides an \"envsubst\" approach to its config.\r\n\r\nAnother solution would be to permit substitution for environment variables in the Livy config parser directly, something HOCON-ish: https://github.com/lightbend/config/blob/master/HOCON.md#goals--background  For the community, it might be a plus to use an existing config library instead of maintaining it's own!\r\n\r\nTo be honest, by environment variable is by far the simplest for most of our deployments!  We use a variety of techniques with different products in dev and prod: one image per machine, or docker-compose, or (in some but not all cases) k8s.  Our devops discourage us from mounting volumes, although IIRC this is simpler if everything is deployed via k8s.\r\n\r\nI'm not entirely sure about the rationale for the whitelist -- the system administrator or devops that has control over the whitelist is the same person that has control over setting environment variables for the image!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/comments/400949686/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/comments/400950371","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-livy/pull/94#issuecomment-400950371","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/94","id":400950371,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMDk1MDM3MQ==","user":{"login":"RyanSkraba","id":7744819,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3NDQ4MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7744819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanSkraba","html_url":"https://github.com/RyanSkraba","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanSkraba/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanSkraba/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanSkraba/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanSkraba/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanSkraba/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanSkraba/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanSkraba/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanSkraba/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanSkraba/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-28T08:10:05Z","updated_at":"2018-06-28T08:10:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> Another solution would be to permit substitution for environment variables in the Livy config parser directly\r\n\r\nSorry -- on reflection, this is what @aromanenko-dev has done in this PR!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/comments/400950371/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/comments/405428458","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-livy/pull/103#issuecomment-405428458","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/103","id":405428458,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNTQyODQ1OA==","user":{"login":"meisam","id":335463,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNTQ2Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/335463?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/meisam","html_url":"https://github.com/meisam","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meisam/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meisam/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meisam/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meisam/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meisam/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meisam/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meisam/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meisam/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meisam/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-17T01:17:35Z","updated_at":"2018-07-17T01:17:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"```\r\nsudo -E apt-get ...\r\n```\r\nfailed on one of the travis instances.

We need to override private methods, so either we do it using reflection and kind of rewriting some methods using reflection or copying the Hive code and doing some very small changes about visibility and very small changes in order to make the code easier to extend (this is the least important reason);\r\n 2. Avoid metastore access from the server, which is otherwise intrinsic in Hive codebase;\r\n 3. This needs further investigation, but the UGI management which is performed automatically by Hive may need to be removed/adjusted in order not to interfere with the one performed by Livy.\r\n\r\nI think that the 1 issue can be easily addressed by cooperating with the Hive community, but the other 2 points may be more critical to address. I'd consider the current situation as a workaround which will be replaced by using only Hive's artifacts once we can  solve the 3 points above with the help of the Hive community.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/comments/414378463/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/comments/414394997","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-livy/pull/104#issuecomment-414394997","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/104","id":414394997,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNDM5NDk5Nw==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-20T17:19:10Z","updated_at":"2018-09-05T13:17:55Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#
