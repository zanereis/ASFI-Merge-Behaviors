It is not that the response is incorrect; it seems like it's a case of incorrect **usage**.\r\n\r\n@narendly \r\n- Statement: I **don't** think `/zookeeper//tmp/aa/bb` is a case of incorrect usage. I do believe it is a **valid** request. I think we can correctly serve both cases.\r\n\r\n- Reasons:\r\n\r\nTypically, a REST endpoint is like `/resources`. If I would like to query a particular resource, I would do `/resources/{identifier}`. In code implementation, I would do\r\n```\r\nRESOURCES_ENDPOINT = \"/resources\"; // already defined somewhere as an endpoint constant\r\nidentifier = \"123\";\r\nuri = RESOURCES_ENDPOINT + \"/\" + identifier; // Is this a correct usage??\r\nrequest(uri);\r\n```\r\nSo, likewise, can I do the same?\r\n```\r\nZOOKEEPER_ENDPOINT = \"/zookeeper\"; // already defined somewhere as an endpoint constant\r\npath = \"/tmp/aa/bb/cc\";\r\nuri = ZOOKEEPER_ENDPOINT + \"/\" + path; // Is this a correct usage??\r\nrequest(uri);\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut current response gives bad request 400 for the request: `uri = ZOOKEEPER_ENDPOINT + \"/\" + path;`\r\nI would ask, did I do it wrong? Why? I would say this is definitely correct. But why could the service not handle my **correct** request?\r\n\r\nVice versa, let's transform the request back: `/zookeeper/tmp/aa/bb` -> `/zookeeper{path}` -> `/resources{identifier}`. Is `/resources{identifier}` a correct REST design?\r\nThe reason why zookeeperAccessor gets pathparam at `tmp/aa/bb` for request `/zookeeper/tmp/aa/bb` is, REST defines/expects `/resources/{id}` and `/zookeeper//tmp/aa/bb` so REST could parse correct path.\r\n\r\nI definitely understand why we don't want 2 slashes: when `/zookeeper//tmp/aa/bb` is manually requested and seen by people, it looks strange and we do want to make it look normal to users. Looking strange is because people usually see single slash, but it does not mean two slashes especially for this case is incorrect.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, if the request is on code level and people don't see it, would it matter? No. But I would expect my correct code to work successfully.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/591556618/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/591559900","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/helix/pull/729#issuecomment-591559900","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/729","id":591559900,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5MTU1OTkwMA==","user":{"login":"zhangmeng916","id":56051770,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MDUxNzcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56051770?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangmeng916","html_url":"https://github.com/zhangmeng916","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangmeng916/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangmeng916/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangmeng916/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangmeng916/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangmeng916/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangmeng916/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangmeng916/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangmeng916/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangmeng916/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-26T17:59:29Z","updated_at":"2020-02-26T17:59:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This PR is ready to be merged, approved by @alirezazamani \r\nFinal commit message:\r\nImplement Helix APIs in CustomizedStateProvider for customers to operate on their own customized state.

The test didn't create external views at all, which will encounter exceptions with the new logic. \r\nThe logic added wasn't supposed to break the tests because the logic is to perform null checks before an if condition that utilizes maps. However, the tests were passing because in the \"and\" if condition, it failed at `isPartitionMap.containsKey(instanceName)` without accessing the second part of the \"and\" condition. Therefore, even though the second part could cause a null pointer failure, it was never an issue. The fix is to reorder the logic such that the conditions are performed separately with null checks right before each map access.
