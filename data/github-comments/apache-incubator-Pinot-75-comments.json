Broker works fine for me. Even in Server case, remove tag worked and edit config worked.\r\n\r\n@mayankshriv the drop behavior is correct. I verified that the backend is returning the message. Something seems off at the backend side. I remember we used to be able to drop instances after table has been deleted. Will check that out.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/712354389/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/712380883","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/6153#issuecomment-712380883","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/6153","id":712380883,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxMjM4MDg4Mw==","user":{"login":"yupeng9","id":13425258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDI1MjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13425258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yupeng9","html_url":"https://github.com/yupeng9","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yupeng9/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yupeng9/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yupeng9/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yupeng9/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yupeng9/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yupeng9/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yupeng9/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yupeng9/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yupeng9/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-19T19:04:40Z","updated_at":"2020-10-19T19:04:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Jackie-Jiang  I think the current implementation assumes the primary key cannot be the time column.

Can we make the sql queries one-to-one mapping with the pql queries?\r\n\r\nIt's a good idea but the thing is that there are some restrictions in SQL comparisons, e.g. in SQL we skip the comparison of MV columns. So if we make it one to one mapping, the number of queries will be reduced. \r\nPlus, SQL requires the order by column to be appeared in the selection clause, which requires us to modify the original queries.

May be you meant GROUP BY since that requires the query change. Also, I don't think we should skip comparing MV columns for SQL. Why can't we leverage the same comparator (that works for PQL) for SQL queries as well? Doing 1-1 test between PQL and SQL would be perfect apples to apples comparison","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/716887472/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/716892305","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/6192#issuecomment-716892305","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/6192","id":716892305,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxNjg5MjMwNQ==","user":{"login":"mcvsubbu","id":2279037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzkwMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2279037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu","html_url":"https://github.com/mcvsubbu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-27T00:04:20Z","updated_at":"2020-10-27T00:04:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jackjlli  for this iteration, if there is comparison missing you can choose to leave it as is with a TODO and an issue (unless you are able to add a comparator trivially).\r\n\r\nMark it as help wanted","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/716892305/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/716895165","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/6192#issuecomment-716895165","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/6192","id":716895165,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxNjg5NTE2NQ==","user":{"login":"jackjlli","id":35080149,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MDgwMTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35080149?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli","html_url":"https://github.com/jackjlli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-27T00:13:02Z","updated_at":"2020-10-27T00:13:02Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@siddharthteotia I agree on that.
