Here is another long list(https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4569).\r\n\r\n@astahlman , ideally we should, and that is part of original plan / discussion for DAG level access(https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3197).  \r\n\r\nWe(Me, Max, Joy) discussed multiple approaches for scheduler auto updated within that pr:\r\n1.  moved all the FAB models inside Airflow model, which scheduler is aware of the FAB models. And scheduler could directly update the tables in this case.  Not a very ideal approach as it will fail once FAB models get updated which requires Airflow updated the model file as well. But ideally it should work with this approach.\r\n2. RBAC is strictly a web construct(Max B's term) which means scheduler is unaware of roles & users, maybe as the supervisor it periodically calls a REST endpoint to trigger creating new perms from new DAGs.  This approach has latency / performance concern.\r\n\r\nWe(that pr) end up with create a cli for periodically sync_perm.\r\n\r\nNot sure how @ashb's approach would work by adding two columns in DAG table given there are no Airflow models defined what are \"roles\"(only exist in FAB models). The role column I assume should be some FK to the ab_roles table.\r\n\r\nNot sure what I described makes sense to you.

['devel_ci']` and checking that no requirements changed):  (!). (in those 42 seconds pulling .wheel images  takes 12 s). This will still be  faster when I decrease number of Dockerfiles/images.\r\n\r\nThen the tests start immediately using prepared image, no further installation/setup etc. happens inside the running airflow-testing container.\r\n\r\nYou can see the timings here:\r\n<img width=\"1121\" alt=\"screenshot 2019-03-06 at 10 03 38\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/595491/53870967-8c052780-3ffb-11e9-9e8b-79010d56a319.png\">\r\n\r\n# Docker Hub builds\r\n\r\nIn case the build  runs from the master branch - DockerHub will run its own build. It will rebuild all the airflow images used for future Travis builds (including cache and official Airflow image). It will continue to catch-up with latest master sources and requirements.\r\n\r\nYou can see such builds here: https://cloud.docker.com/repository/docker/potiuk/airflow/timeline \r\n\r\nThey take around 15 minutes on DockerHub slow machines. And sometimes they are delayed by many hours (last two builds were queued for 8 hours). However this is not a big issue as the whole system will work incrementally using latest available builds as base and it will get eventually consistent:\r\n\r\n\r\n![d0nsd7yx0aaru3t](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/595491/53870720-0e411c00-3ffb-11e9-9908-92d6c3787e33.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/470036483/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/470041163","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4841#issuecomment-470041163","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4841","id":470041163,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MDA0MTE2Mw==","user":{"login":"ffinfo","id":2419555,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MTk1NTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2419555?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffinfo","html_url":"https://github.com/ffinfo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffinfo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffinfo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffinfo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffinfo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffinfo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffinfo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffinfo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffinfo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffinfo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-06T09:48:35Z","updated_at":"2019-03-06T09:48:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ashb That's already to late, for each endpoint there is already an ticket ;)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/470041163/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/470058146","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4784#issuecomment-470058146","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4784","id":470058146,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MDA1ODE0Ng==","user":{"login":"mik-laj","id":12058428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj","html_url":"https://github.com/mik-laj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-06T10:38:54Z","updated_at":"2019-03-06T10:38:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Yes.

@mik-laj ! Thanks for your quick feedback, I created and linked the Jira issue, and I'll get the fixes pushed up in a bit (doing more testing first). However, I'd like to quickly answer your questions!\r\n\r\n> What is the difference between Docker, Docker Swarm, Kubernetes and Signularity? \r\n\r\nDocker and Singularity are both container technologies - the unit of operation for something like Docker Swarm, or Kubernetes. Singularity recently became OCI compliant with version 3.1.0, so we will (soon) see an ability to plug Singularity containers into a cluster akin to Docker (but more development is needed first). From an abstraction, From a \"what are they made of\" perspective, Docker and Singularity are hugely similar, the main difference being that Docker containers are assembled from .tar.gz layers, while Singularity containers are single, read only filesystems.  From a software / security perspective, they are very different. Singularity came along to solve the problem of Docker having a root daemon (and thus not being installable on a shared HPC resource) and as a result, Singularity is the container of choice for Scientific compute. So logically, if we want to use containers with AIrflow in this environment, we need Singularity.  This is why I want to explore this operator - I would like to test and use AIrflow in this context. If Singularity containers work well with Airflow, I'd next look into adding (what I think are considered executors?) akin to Kubernetes, we could use a SLURM or SGE job manager.\r\n\r\nBut for now - Singularity on the level of operator is the right thing - because it's just like Docker. From a high level, you can think of a Singularity container as a binary with (some other software) inside. It has all the weird (not user friendly) options like adding volumes (binds) and other runtime customizations that makes it ideal to provide to the user as an Operator. Does that answer your questions?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/470208501/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/470235058","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4829#issuecomment-470235058","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4829","id":470235058,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MDIzNTA1OA==","user":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-06T19:07:30Z","updated_at":"2019-03-06T19:07:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@feluelle the k8s tests are a bit flaky.

It looks like the issue it's fixed is not for the issue I've raised.\r\n\r\nIf I pass a Jinja template to a templated field, the type of the content would be string.

Also the order of statements is changes a bit because dags_query was build up on multiple statements but in-between the error query was there. this is now grouped.\r\n\r\nAbout the switch from provide_session to create_session. Me and @Fokko did a little research and using create_session keeps less time a session locked to a scope. `@provide_session` on nested sessions can keep the session open for a long time while not really needed.
