So seems merge-base is not necessary. \r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/757078648/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/757089909","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7232#issuecomment-757089909","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7232","id":757089909,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1NzA4OTkwOQ==","user":{"login":"comaniac","id":8262694,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNjI2OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8262694?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac","html_url":"https://github.com/comaniac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-09T03:49:23Z","updated_at":"2021-01-09T03:49:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @mbrookhart @yzhliu ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/757089909/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/757379032","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/7186#issuecomment-757379032","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7186","id":757379032,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1NzM3OTAzMg==","user":{"login":"sxjscience","id":5178350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzgzNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5178350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience","html_url":"https://github.com/sxjscience","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-09T22:47:49Z","updated_at":"2021-01-09T22:47:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Also, there is another issue that I observed in GluonNLP: https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/1425 .

A [batch, num_classes, num_anchors, 5] format would give us a nicely defined slice of memory where the same-class anchors are located.\r\n\r\n> TF takes a 1D tensor of scores and concats it to the boxes before performing get_valid_counts and nms. I'm not sure if the rest of the TF graph is handling the loop over batch size and classes.\r\n\r\nThat's correct, TF's NMS is only for single class and single batch, so the TF graph loops over batches and classes. To do that, they use [tf.map_fn](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/map_fn) so the execution of each NMS can actually still run in parallel. However, this turns into a mess of control flow operators and TensorArrays, so Relay isn't able to do the same parallelization.

Current API is over complicated due to the need to support both styles. If we can assume that `return_indices` is always True, we can clean up our API a lot.

We don't need `coord_start`, `score_index`, and `id_index` arguments, if inputs are only unpacked.\r\n\r\nSupporting `max_output_boxes_per_class` needs change in the implementation as well.
