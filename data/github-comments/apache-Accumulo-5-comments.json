The crux of things is that the method `createFrameBuffer` exists on `SelectAcceptThread` _not_ `THsHaServer` (or in its lineage). The easiest hack I saw was to inject our own custom `SelectAcceptThread`, akin to what we were doing with the `FrameBuffer`. Eric messed up the changes and used the `AsyncFrameBuffer` interface instead of the `FrameBuffer` class in his original commit too (we don't use the Async Processors -- our rpc system is blocking).\n\nI think that's the best synopsis of what's going on here. I would also be OK with throwing in the thrift warning.

This can cause some very unexpected and undesirable behavior in some plugins, especially packaging/assembly plugins, which might create \"dirty\" artifacts containing these configuration files.\n\nThey might also not get properly ignored by a wide variety of plugins. I say this not to object, but only to document that we need to pay attention to these files, if they make it into the source tree, and we need to be extra careful to check that they do not exist in any of our released artifacts. (which is an easy enough check to do).\n\nIt would be nice if Netbeans allowed putting these files outside the source tree, or if it wrote them as dotfiles. Perhaps that's an option?

Your right, its not as bad as I thought.  Although there is still problem.  With the per thread mutation writers, mutations bound for the same tserver may never be merged in some cases.  This situations are less likely to occur though.  I am thinking of something like the following.\n- Thread 1 bins 1000 mutations for 20 tservers\n- 3 tserver queues are processed by send threads\n- Thread 2 bins 1000 mutations for 20 tserver (at this point 17 tservers from the 1st binning are not processed by send threads, those mutations are not merged together).\n\nThis makes me wonder, why have a mutation writer per thread?  Why not just add to the mutation writer outside of the sync?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/189385925/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/189420402","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/75#issuecomment-189420402","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/75","id":189420402,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4OTQyMDQwMg==","user":{"login":"dlmarion","id":567911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NzkxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/567911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion","html_url":"https://github.com/dlmarion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-26T18:48:39Z","updated_at":"2016-02-26T18:48:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Talked with Keith offline and he suggested a simpler route.
