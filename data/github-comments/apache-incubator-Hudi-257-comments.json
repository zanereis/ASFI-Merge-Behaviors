we discussed, there is a risk of landing this if there are any changes on the bundles at this point.  Before landing the PR:\r\n(1) we should try to avoid any dependency change for production code and bundling.  Adjusting dependency for tests is ok and should be limited to tests only.  We shouldn't change the compile pom for merely fixing tests.\r\n(2) for any disabled tests in Azure CI, try to find a way to run them in Github CI to maintain the coverage.\r\n(3) make sure root pom changes for switching profiles do not change any behavior for building all bundles.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1193065573/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1193066164","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/6159#issuecomment-1193066164","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/6159","id":1193066164,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5HHL60","user":{"login":"yihua","id":2497195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTcxOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2497195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua","html_url":"https://github.com/yihua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-23T05:47:33Z","updated_at":"2022-07-23T05:47:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"IT failure is due to Flink which is unrelated.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1193066164/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1193067420","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/6020#issuecomment-1193067420","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/6020","id":1193067420,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5HHMOc","user":{"login":"xushiyan","id":2701446,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDE0NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2701446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan","html_url":"https://github.com/xushiyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-23T05:58:51Z","updated_at":"2022-07-23T05:58:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@KnightChess can you rebase master pls?

found there is a commit for fixing an issue in `AppendWriteFunction`\r\n\r\nIssue: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-4332\r\nPR: https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/5988\r\n\r\nAs I understand, this patch changed when `currentInstant` changing in `AppendWriteFunction`. Before fix, this `currentInstant` was changed in the method `initWriterHelper()` when handle a new record. In the patch, `currentInstant` was changed in method `flushData(boolean endInput)` when trigger a new checkpoint.\r\n\r\nMay I know how this patch fix this issue? Since there is barely information in the ticket, could you share more detail?

The original row writer impl originated in overhead from doing `df.queryExecution.toRdd` [here](https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/622d27a099f5dec96f992fd423b666083da4b24a/hudi-client/hudi-spark-client/src/main/scala/org/apache/hudi/HoodieSparkUtils.scala#L160), done before Avro record conversion. We traced this into a code in Spark, that makes an additional pass (almost) to materialize the Rows with a schema to be used by the iterator.\r\n\r\n2. I see that in 0.11.1 we were just [processing](https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/622d27a099f5dec96f992fd423b666083da4b24a/hudi-spark-datasource/hudi-spark-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/HoodieDatasetBulkInsertHelper.java#L74) the dataframe as `DataSet<Row>` and ergo the use of UDFs for the other functionality. This is what's been fixed in 0.12 now. \r\n\r\n\r\nI want to understand how we are avoiding the RDD conversion costs, in the current approach? This cost becomes obvious when you do records with large number of columns (due to overhead per record) \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1194344129/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
