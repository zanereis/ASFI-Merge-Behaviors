Its check is usually done before GC throw out weak references (`ThreadLocalMap.Entry` is a `WeakReference`), so Tomcat logs something like:\n\n```\n06-Oct-2014 19:37:41.009 SEVERE [RMI TCP Connection(14)-127.0.0.1] org.apache.catalina.loader.WebappClassLoader.checkThreadLocalMapForLeaks The web application [] created a ThreadLocal with \n  key of type [org.apache.tika.parser.image.ImageMetadataExtractor$ExifHandler$1] (value [org.apache.tika.parser.image.ImageMetadataExtractor$ExifHandler$1@3a97b29a]) \n  and a value of type [java.text.SimpleDateFormat] (value [java.text.SimpleDateFormat@6b2ed43a]) \n  but failed to remove it when the web application was stopped. \n  Threads are going to be renewed over time to try and avoid a probable memory leak.\n```\n\nIf I force several GCs after application undeploy this thread local is usually collected. I think you can remove PR #17 and let this PR merge into tika.\n\nTo test that it's collected I created simple servlet:\n\n``` java\n@WebServlet(name = \"t\", urlPatterns = {\"/t\"})\npublic class AppServlet extends HttpServlet {\n  @Override\n  protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp) throws ServletException, IOException {\n    Metadata metadata = new Metadata();\n    try {\n      new ImageMetadataExtractor(metadata).parseJpeg(new File(\"/home/gross/repo/tl-test/test.jpeg\"));\n    } catch (SAXException | TikaException e) {\n      throw new ServletException(e);\n    }\n    resp.getWriter()\n        .append(metadata.get(TIFF.ORIGINAL_DATE));\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWhich is deployed to tomcat 8 with VM running with `-XX:+PrintGCDetails -XX:+TraceClassUnloading` to see class unloading and GC executions. To force GC I used `jcmd <pid> GC.run` or _Perform GC_ in `jvisualvm`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/comments/58043302/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/comments/58085193","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tika/pull/17#issuecomment-58085193","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/17","id":58085193,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MDg1MTkz","user":{"login":"grossws","id":171284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MTI4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/171284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/grossws","html_url":"https://github.com/grossws","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grossws/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grossws/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grossws/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grossws/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grossws/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grossws/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grossws/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grossws/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grossws/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-10-06T19:58:38Z","updated_at":"2014-10-06T19:58:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"See PR #15\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/comments/58085193/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/comments/58085438","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tika/pull/15#issuecomment-58085438","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/15","id":58085438,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MDg1NDM4","user":{"login":"grossws","id":171284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MTI4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/171284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/grossws","html_url":"https://github.com/grossws","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grossws/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grossws/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grossws/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grossws/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grossws/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grossws/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grossws/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grossws/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grossws/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-10-06T19:59:49Z","updated_at":"2014-10-06T19:59:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Also, about different webapp (or things that use non-trivial classloader configuration) memory leaks: http://wiki.apache.org/tomcat/MemoryLeakProtection\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/comments/58085438/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/comments/58088330","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tika/pull/17#issuecomment-58088330","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/17","id":58088330,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MDg4MzMw","user":{"login":"vilmospapp","id":861105,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MTEwNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/861105?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vilmospapp","html_url":"https://github.com/vilmospapp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vilmospapp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vilmospapp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vilmospapp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vilmospapp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vilmospapp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vilmospapp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vilmospapp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vilmospapp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vilmospapp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-10-06T20:14:05Z","updated_at":"2014-10-06T20:14:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @grossws \n\nI modified it, so the destroy will run only once.

Also, it can be in any app with non-trivial classloading (like OSGi apps).\n\nSo, it's ok to merge this PR. But tomcat 6+ will log errors after unloading webapp used this class since it's quite paranoidal. Maybe, some info should be added to documentation about this behavior to avoid issues creation in jira.\n\nPR #17 was closed by @vilmospapp.\n\nFYI, Joshua Bloch wrote:\n\n> There are many compelling uses for thread locals.  Here are a few off the top of my head:\n> (1) Genuine per-thread context, such as user id or transaction id.  Works great.  Easy to clean up when the thread exits the scope. No leaks.\n> (2) Per-thread instances for performance.  Aaron's SimpleDateFormat example (above) is one example of this pattern.\n> (3) \"Sleazing\" values through callbacks that you don't control: sometimes you must call a library method that calls back into your package.  At this point, you need some context that you were unable to pass to yourself, due to deficiencies in the library.  In this rare situation, thread locals can be a lifesaver.\n> \n> In all of these cases, thread locals are the right thing to use. Can you cause unintended object retention with thread locals? Sure you can. But you can do this with arrays too. That doesn't mean that thread locals (or arrays) are bad things. Merely that you have to use them with some care. The use of thread pools demands extreme care. Sloppy use of thread pools in combination with sloppy use of thread locals can cause unintended object retention, as has been noted in many places. But placing the blame on thread locals is unwarranted.  Virtually all threading systems of which I'm aware provide support for thread local variables.

After trashing maven's cache on both system it now works on my notebook, but fails on my desktop machine. Sounds like a race condition or something. I think [this issue](https://github.com/rometools/rome/issues/135) might be the cause (OSGi class loading issue). Looking at the _rome_ 1.5.0 jar file, I noticed the manifest dropped those Import-Package/Export-Package clauses that are likely really imported for OSGi. Definately not the \"this'll be a quick patch to submit\" I initially and naively thought ... and OSGi is nothing I have experience with. So, close this issue (upgrading to rome 1.5) and try again with rome 2.0 or so?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/comments/59001558/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/comments/59047885","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tika/pull/19#issuecomment-59047885","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/19","id":59047885,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5MDQ3ODg1","user":{"login":"chrismattmann","id":395887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NTg4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/395887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrismattmann","html_url":"https://github.com/chrismattmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrismattmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrismattmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrismattmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrismattmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrismattmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrismattmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrismattmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrismattmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrismattmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-10-14T13:55:40Z","updated_at":"2014-10-14T13:55:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"No worries @jotomo it would be great to take this to the dev@tika.apache.org - there are OSGI experts there and we may get someone to review your patch that knows what to do.
