That's the reason why we accept the base snapshot id in the constructor. We collect all added files since that snapshot. So, we will probably need to do the same for `OverwriteFiles`.\r\n\r\nSecond, we cannot mark deleted files using `overwriteByRowFilter` as that would require all rows to match the predicate and it would also require proper column stats when we have predicates on non-partition columns. So, it seems we will need some sort of `overwriteFiles(deletedFiles, addedFiles)` or `deleteFile(file)`.\r\n\r\nThird, we cannot use the expression passed to `overwriteByRowFilter` for conflict resolution because of the aforementioned differences. Also, in certain cases, we cannot convert all filters in query engines into equivalent Iceberg filters. Internally, we prohibit concurrent appends in such cases and pass a set of files to delete. It seems we need a separate expression for validating concurrent appends. So, `allowConflictingAppends` or `validateNoConflictingAppends` will probably need to accept a row filter as well. By default, we can set that expression to either true or false depending on what behaviour we want.\r\n\r\nFourth, we already have `validateAddedFiles` that ensures that all files added by `OverwriteFiles` match the predicate passed in `overwriteByRowFilter`. Calling `validateAddedFiles` will only make sense if we use `overwriteByRowFilter`, so we need to document that properly to avoid misuse of the API. Then `validateAddedFiles` will operate on files passed to `OverwriteFiles` and `allowConflictingAppends` or `validateNoConflictingAppends` will operate on all files added since the base snapshot.\r\n\r\n@rdblue, how do you see the merged API?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/519054168/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/519064936","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/179#issuecomment-519064936","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/179","id":519064936,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxOTA2NDkzNg==","user":{"login":"timmylicheng","id":5977937,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Nzc5Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5977937?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timmylicheng","html_url":"https://github.com/timmylicheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timmylicheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timmylicheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timmylicheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timmylicheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timmylicheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timmylicheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timmylicheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timmylicheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timmylicheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-07T11:57:55Z","updated_at":"2019-08-07T11:57:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"No work done yet.

I think it should be possible to start an overwrite, then scan the same table state, where both operations use the current snapshot ID. If we want to be explicit about the snapshot that is read, we could alternatively add a method to set it.\r\n\r\n> we will need some sort of overwriteFiles(deletedFiles, addedFiles) or deleteFile(file)\r\n\r\nI think it makes sense to add `deleteFile`. This is already supported in the implementation, `MergingSnapshotProducer` that is used for almost all operations.\r\n\r\n> in certain cases, we cannot convert all filters in query engines into equivalent Iceberg filters\r\n\r\nIn these cases, the validation must be that the current snapshot ID has not changed, right? In that case, we just need to specify that's the requirement with something like `validateNoConflictingAppends()` -- if there is no filter then it means any write in the entire table would conflict.\r\n\r\nAn alternative is to use a more generic filter. We can safely drop `and` predicates if they can't be converted. For example, if the filter is `date(ts) = '2019-06-01' AND hour(ts) = 10`, the second predicate can't be converted (there is no hour-of-day transform). But, we can make sure that none of the data for the entire day has changed instead of just hour 10.\r\n\r\n> we cannot use the expression passed to overwriteByRowFilter for conflict resolution . . . validateNoConflictingAppends will probably need to accept a row filter as well.\r\n\r\nAgreed.

Maybe it should be `validateAddedFilesMatchRowFilter`. In addition, I think we might want to add preconditions that check to make sure this method isn't used with other configuration methods that may conflict.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/519167629/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/519192573","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/355#issuecomment-519192573","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/355","id":519192573,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxOTE5MjU3Mw==","user":{"login":"TGooch44","id":1591711,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTE3MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1591711?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TGooch44","html_url":"https://github.com/TGooch44","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TGooch44/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TGooch44/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TGooch44/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TGooch44/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TGooch44/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TGooch44/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TGooch44/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TGooch44/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TGooch44/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-07T17:24:14Z","updated_at":"2019-08-07T17:24:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Should be fine we talked about it over slack.

I think it should be possible to start an overwrite, then scan the same table state, where both operations use the current snapshot ID. \r\n\r\nCould you elaborate a bit? I am not sure I got the use case. In general, knowing the snapshot that was read is essential to guarantee serializable isolation in case of updates/deletes. It also has to stay the same during retries as we have to analyze every operation that happened after we read the data. The main motivation to accept it in the constructor is to avoid asking the user to set one more parameter right. Without the correct base snapshot, `validateNoConflictingAppends` is useless. I have a test for such a use case [here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-iceberg/pull/351/files#diff-96ff93512d7be21e69f35e2bc96f03e9R525). For existing use cases with `overwriteByRowFilter`, it should not have any impact and is also not visible to the user.\r\n\r\n> In these cases, the validation must be that the current snapshot ID has not changed, right?\r\n\r\nNot necessarily, I guess. If there is a delete that removed other files (i.e. not the ones that we are rewriting), it should be OK to commit the update. So, I would probably rely on a more generic row filter being set (we do this internally now).\r\n\r\nBased on the discussion, the API can look like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nOverwriteFiles overwriteByRowFilter(Expression expr);\r\nOverwriteFiles addFile(DataFile file);\r\nOverwriteFiles deleteFile(DataFile file);\r\nOverwriteFiles validateAddedFilesMatchRowFilter();\r\nOverwriteFiles validateNoConflictingAppends(Expression expr);\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy default, the expr for `validateNoConflictingAppends` can be set to `false` to match the current behaviour. As of now, if we are rewriting via `overwriteByRowFilter`, `OverwriteFiles` will successfully retry and delete matching files added in a concurrent transaction.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we can consider an API with `allowConflictingAppends(expr)` but that will change the current behaviour.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/519237696/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/519238245","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/170#issuecomment-519238245","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/170","id":519238245,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxOTIzODI0NQ==","user":{"login":"guilload","id":3011588,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMTE1ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3011588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilload","html_url":"https://github.com/guilload","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilload/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilload/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilload/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilload/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilload/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilload/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilload/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilload/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilload/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-07T19:32:00Z","updated_at":"2019-08-07T19:32:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hey,\r\n\r\nI started working on an MR InputFormat for Iceberg since there’s some overlap with the InputFormat I’m working on for Hive.

For instance, `parquet-mr` relies on the `ReadSupport` interface to solve a similar problem and ships with a default `GroupReadSupport` implementation.\r\n\r\nHere's my WIP branch:\r\nhttps://github.com/guilload/incubator-iceberg/pull/1\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/519342060/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/519406362","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/314#issuecomment-519406362","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/314","id":519406362,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxOTQwNjM2Mg==","user":{"login":"manishmalhotrawork","id":22434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDM0MDEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manishmalhotrawork","html_url":"https://github.com/manishmalhotrawork","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manishmalhotrawork/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manishmalhotrawork/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manishmalhotrawork/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manishmalhotrawork/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manishmalhotrawork/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manishmalhotrawork/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manishmalhotrawork/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manishmalhotrawork/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manishmalhotrawork/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-08T07:41:01Z","updated_at":"2019-08-08T07:41:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"closing this one, as `TestParquetMetrics` is refactored.\r\nopened [PR-365](https://github.com/apache/incubator-iceberg/pull/365)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/519406362/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/519485711","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/279#issuecomment-519485711","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/279","id":519485711,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxOTQ4NTcxMQ==","user":{"login":"waterlx","id":13976495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTc2NDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13976495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/waterlx","html_url":"https://github.com/waterlx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waterlx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waterlx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waterlx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waterlx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waterlx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waterlx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waterlx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waterlx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waterlx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-08T11:50:15Z","updated_at":"2019-08-08T11:50:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @rdblue please correct me if I am wrong:\r\nI am not sure if Transforms.day() is the function to transfer timestamps to date, it is to produce Dates.DAY or Timestamp.DAY (either is Transform) from Types.DateType or Types.TimestampType.

This is an area where we haven't invested more time because we are currently only supporting a small set of in-memory representations. What I would like is to eventually make a way to plug in representations for struct, map, and list and have a generic way to support those across data formats.\r\n\r\nConsider struct, for example. Iceberg uses an interface, `StructLike`, to work with struct objects. So if we write a `ValueReader` for Parquet and a `ValueReader` for Avro that supports a `StructLike`, we could then add an interface like this for plugging in a custom type:\r\n\r\n```\r\ninterface DataModel<S extends StructLike, M extends Map, L extends List> {\r\n  S newStruct();\r\n  M newMap();\r\n  L newList();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSome of the value readers are already generic and can also convert from an intermediate representation to a final representation. If we supported intermediate and final representations, then your final type wouldn't even need to implement `StructLike`. You could use a wrapper to translate from `StructLike` to your record's API and then return your

Anything specific I need to test/validate if this change impacts the metadata tables?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/522798222/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/522800271","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/279#issuecomment-522800271","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/279","id":522800271,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMjgwMDI3MQ==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-20T00:08:18Z","updated_at":"2019-08-20T00:08:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> can you point me to any other test-case or code path, where [getResultType] is being used can be verified.\r\n\r\nThere might not be one.
