@VMahipalReddy,\r\n\r\nFor thick client you can try this: [Running Client Nodes Behind NAT](https://ignite.apache.org/docs/latest/clustering/running-client-nodes-behind-nat).\r\n\r\nFor thin client, there are some notable points:\r\n1. Some requests, such as explicit transactions does not support partition awareness.\r\n1. All operations, which does not support partition awareness are performed through the node which thin client is connected to. Since 2.12 thin client connects to the first address from specified addresses list, so if you run many clients with the same addresses list, all of them will be connected to a single node.  As a workaround you can perform manual shuffling of addresses in your code. In 2.15 connection balancing will be introduced: [IGNITE-18637](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IGNITE-18637)\r\n\r\n> Data is not getting distributed\r\n\r\nWhich metric is displayed on the attached picture?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/comments/1514365894/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/comments/1514398067","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ignite/issues/10627#issuecomment-1514398067","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/10627","id":1514398067,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdkdzs5aQ-Fz","user":{"login":"shishkovilja","id":17990810,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTkwODEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17990810?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shishkovilja","html_url":"https://github.com/shishkovilja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shishkovilja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shishkovilja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shishkovilja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shishkovilja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shishkovilja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shishkovilja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shishkovilja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shishkovilja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shishkovilja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-19T09:13:06Z","updated_at":"2023-04-19T15:37:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @nwpuqyj ,\r\nAccording to documentation, in 2.x it is still in beta state, but as I know it is stable enough at least for testing, so you can check it in your test environment.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/comments/1514398067/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
