Usually, the tables used in real-time applications are partitioned and most of the query filters are on the partition column.  Hence I thought partition-level stats are more useful than table-level stats. But yeah, need more time for engines to adopt it I guess. Currently, Dremio uses partition stats.

Thank you for your review. Let's discuss the problem you raised separately.\r\n\r\n- As you said, small iceberg table can be easily loaded into the memory by using cache, and the query performance is also very fast. Therefore, from this point on, cache may always be enabled. However, there are some circumstances to consider. First, in our solution, _lookup-join-cache-size_ and _lookup-join-cache-ttl_ are provided to control the cache size and expiration time respectively, so that the cache size can be set according to actual conditions and the queried data can be guaranteed to be the latest. Secondly, this scheme improves query efficiency by storing data with the same primary key in the cache. If the cache does not contain data with the same primary key, the latest data will be loaded from the table. In addition, if a taskmanager has 8 slots,lookup function needs to cache a copy of the data set. lookup function is just a basic function capability that can be used in the future to optimize enhanced performance, such as secondary indexes and so on. At present iceberg does not support this basic function, which can satisfy the requirements of many scenarios.\r\n- FLILP-204 [2] just raises the cache hit ratio, user could use a hint to enable partitioned lookup join which enforces input of lookup join to hash shuffle by look up  keys.  This can indeed relieve the pressure of cache, but the iceberg table for larger data does not support it well. But based on the basic lookup function, we can apply this in the future.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1379970862/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1380107713","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/6370#issuecomment-1380107713","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/6370","id":1380107713,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85SQsXB","user":{"login":"pvary","id":19705742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzA1NzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19705742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary","html_url":"https://github.com/pvary","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-12T10:19:14Z","updated_at":"2023-01-12T10:19:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Created #6570 for removing the locks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1380107713/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1380222405","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/6074#issuecomment-1380222405","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/6074","id":1380222405,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85SRIXF","user":{"login":"gaborkaszab","id":29145491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTQ1NDkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29145491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab","html_url":"https://github.com/gaborkaszab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-12T11:59:30Z","updated_at":"2023-01-12T11:59:30Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Hey @rdblue ,\r\nMay I ask for another round of review?
