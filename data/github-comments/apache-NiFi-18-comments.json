Verified that the template can be run in the second NiFi\n\nEverything worked great up to step 2d, running the imported template in the second NiFi.  After CTRL-A selecting everything and clicking Run, I got this nastygram: `LocalPort[name=stuff to log,id=9c17cb62-4df3-4122-ab36-44f290dc2bce] is not a member of this Process Group`\n\nWhich is a reference to an input port in a Process Group nested in a Process Group.  Manually navigating around the flow and starting all of the components worked fine without errors.  I get a similar error stopping the flow.  \n\nThe id \"9c17...\" is not in the template XML file.  From poking around at the API it does exist, it is the \"stuff to log\" input port as expected in my template.  The parent-child relationships between Process Groups and Input Ports looked OK to the untrained eye.  What make this weirder is that I get a comparable error on the original NiFi I exported the template from.  So I'm not sure this is a problem specific to this fix.  \n\n[TestNiFi1941FixTemplate.xml.txt](https://github.com/apache/nifi/files/319518/TestNiFi1941FixTemplate.xml.txt)\nMatt, are you aware of this issue, and do you experience this importing and running the attached template?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/226643591/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/226646636","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/532#issuecomment-226646636","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/532","id":226646636,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNjY0NjYzNg==","user":{"login":"mcgilman","id":123395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzM5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman","html_url":"https://github.com/mcgilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-16T23:54:59Z","updated_at":"2016-06-16T23:54:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jvwing Thanks for jumping in to review! I am not aware of this specific issue though I know we have a number of outside JIRAs surrounding templates and the 1.0.0 release.

This allows us to drop the same template on the canvas as many times as we want to.\n\nThe issue you mentioned may even lay in some REST API changes for starting components.

In order to run integration tests, we need to run apache ignite 1.6 locally (or create the proper xml configuration file - just like under the src/test/resources directory).  \n2. There are two integration tests (and a suite of unit tests) with the module.  The integration tests validate the data the contents of the flow with the data in the ignite cache.\n3. If the config file is not provided the processor creates a ignite client which tries to discover the ignite cluster on the localhost.  This could be used in case a single Nifi node is collocated with Ignite Cache node. But if you think making the configuration file required is a better safer choice, let me know.  Also, when I run the processor using Nifi application, I can see the entry count corresponding the flow files in ignite cache by using the ignitevisorcmd.sh application.  If you see any problems with it, please let me know and I will to reproduce the scenario locally.  \n4. Regarding provenance, Ignite tries to shield the clients from the servers by using a discovery spi.  While we can find out all the remote or local nodes in the cluster using this spi, we do not know which nodes will host the entry.  Getting all the nodes in the cluster will also impact the performance if we do it for the provenance of each flow file.  So, I've changed provenance to provide cache name which is how the client should access the entries.  Let me know your thoughts on it.\n5. The logs for Ignite can be handled by changing the log levels and I will look into it.\n6. I've been able to start/stop the cache and don't see the exceptions you've mentioned. If you have specific steps to reproduce them, please let me know.\n\n@apiri - My thought was that this processor is an egress component for streaming large volume/velocity data to the ignite cache.  If you have any thought/recommendation for me, please let me know.\n\nThanks for all your advice.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/226683680/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/226685947","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/239#issuecomment-226685947","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/239","id":226685947,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNjY4NTk0Nw==","user":{"login":"jvwing","id":3151078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTEwNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3151078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing","html_url":"https://github.com/jvwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-17T05:49:35Z","updated_at":"2016-06-17T05:49:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for noticing that, I didn't realize it would cross-link.

A header and footer could be added later or even just a header could be added and the demarcator could be considered the footer.  Something like that.\n\nHowever, what I do think needs to be considered now is adding a way for the character set of the demarcator to be expressed explicitly.  Right now it calls demarcator.getBytes() and that will result in different behavior on different platforms and such string to byte cases always cause issues when not explicit.  Easy change for sure.  Could also allow the user to supply a file containing bytes as an another option as well.  Anyway - would do the simplest approach now which gets this processor in circulation then let usage dictate next steps.\n\nThanks\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/226916432/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/226918206","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/272#issuecomment-226918206","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/272","id":226918206,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNjkxODIwNg==","user":{"login":"taftster","id":7379639,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNzk2Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7379639?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/taftster","html_url":"https://github.com/taftster","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taftster/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taftster/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taftster/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taftster/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taftster/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taftster/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taftster/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taftster/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taftster/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-18T03:02:22Z","updated_at":"2016-06-18T03:02:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I'm happy with this PR.

I'm doing some review, and considering the following topics:\n- **NiFi's AWS SDK Version** - Since you submitted this PR, Amazon appears to have made signature version 4 the default for S3 in their Java SDK v1.11.0, May 13, 2016.  NiFi's current SDK version is 1.10.32 from Nov 3, 2015.  Upgrading the SDK would apply much broader than this feature, but maybe not out of line for the v1.0 release.  If we chose not to upgrade now, we might consider that in a future upgrade the signature version defaults will change.\n- **Controlling Signature Versions** - Regardless of the SDK default, you are absolutely right to make it optional.  I'm a bit baffled by why Amazon uses a System property to control this setting rather than a client or request property, and a bit concerned about multiple processors fighting over the signature version.  I agree that `System.setProperty(...)` is the [documented method of setting the signature version](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingAWSSDK.html).  But I don't like it, I would prefer to set this more concisely than a global setting.  Are you familiar with [`ClientConfiguration::setSignerOverride()`](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/ClientConfiguration.html#setSignerOverride%28java.lang.String%29)?  It appears to allow this, if not so well documented.\n- **SSE KMS for FetchS3Object** - We might also want to apply this feature to the FetchS3Object processor, or at least to allow for that to happen in the future.  Have you considered moving some of the KMS logic to the AbstractS3Processor class? \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/227176388/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/227178221","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/525#issuecomment-227178221","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/525","id":227178221,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNzE3ODIyMQ==","user":{"login":"brosander","id":596137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NjEzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/596137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brosander","html_url":"https://github.com/brosander","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brosander/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brosander/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brosander/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brosander/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brosander/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brosander/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brosander/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brosander/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brosander/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-20T15:33:14Z","updated_at":"2016-06-20T15:33:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@JPercivall I believe I have incorporated all of the suggested changes (except for the XPath validator because it didn't like some of the provided examples in the api doc).
