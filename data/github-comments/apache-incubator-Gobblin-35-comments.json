TaskState is written using an FsStateStore.  Changes are to store both of these state types using StateStores that can be backed by a non-filesystem storage.\r\n\r\nStateStores store data with a key of (root, storeName, tableName). The root may be a path prefix in file system and ZK state stores.  For DB state store it is a DB table. storeName is the next level of the hierarchy. tableName is the last level and what is traditionally the file name, such as work_unit_name.wu is used for this field.\r\n\r\nWorkUnits are stored at appWorkdir/_workunits/<job_id>/<work_unit_id>.wu.\r\nMultiWorkUnits are stored at  appWorkdir/_workunits/<job_id>/<work_unit_id>.mwu\r\nTaskStates are stored at  appWorkdir/_taskstates/<job_id>/<task_id>.tst\r\n\r\nThe path used in the test GobblinHelixTaskTest was changed to conform to the format above.\r\n\r\nThree StateStores are instantiated through GobblinClusterUtils.StateStores for storing and accessing these states.  The StateStore type comes from the configuration key 'state.store.type'.\r\nThe configuration of 'state.store.root.dir' and 'state.store.db.table' are set before creating each StateStore to configure the proper root directory and root table.\r\n\r\nThe ParallelRunner is used to serialize and deserialize in parallel. A method that accepts a Callable was added to allow submitting the StateStore serialization and deserialization tasks. This generic interface was required due to avoid a build dependency issue.\r\n\r\nStateStore changes:\r\nChanged the ZK state put calls to create with data atomically when the znode does not exist.\r\nAdded a getStateNames() method for listing. This is required by the TaskStateCollectorService to find data to read.\r\nAdded factory method to StateStore and refactored some code shared between the DatasetStateStore factory and StateStore factory.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/270969005/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/270976894","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/1505#issuecomment-270976894","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/1505","id":270976894,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MDk3Njg5NA==","user":{"login":"htran1","id":23297947,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjk3OTQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23297947?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1","html_url":"https://github.com/htran1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-06T18:57:02Z","updated_at":"2017-01-06T18:57:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ibuenros
