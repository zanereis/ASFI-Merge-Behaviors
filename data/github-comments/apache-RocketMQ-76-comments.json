I think the jedgment '**writePos - lastCommittedPosition > commitLeastPages**' in the method 'commit0' of class 'MappedFile' is meaningless in the version 4.8.0.\r\n>

'writePos - lastCommittedPosition' represents the amount of data that has not been committed, it's in byte. but commitLeastPages represents the least pages(OS_PAGE) should be committed. 'commitLeastPages ' has been determined in method ‘isAbleToCommit’ whether it meets the condition. so '**writePos - lastCommittedPosition > commitLeastPages**' is meaningless, although this expression does not cause errors.\r\n> I think this expression should be 'writePos - lastCommittedPosition > 0', it used to determine whether there is uncommitted data.
