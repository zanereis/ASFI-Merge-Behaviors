As for the shared states,\r\n    1. Can multiple `FMutateInputs` be used? Or should I just return multiple variables for one `FMutateInputs`? Can you provide an example?\r\n    2. How can the registered `FMutateInputs` be used? Currently I haven't found the position in batch normalization implementation files where the [`std::vector<uint32_t>{3, 4}`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/8302/files?diff=split#diff-c7e5df696274a535051595cc84f35353R445) is used.\r\n    3. What if the size of the variable storing intermediate results can only be determined during the computation on the fly? In such cases, I will need to compute the size of the variable and allocate the space dynamically (`Blob::Reshape()` in Caffe). And I will need to switch between CPU and GPU storage during the computation (`Blob::cpu_data()` and `Blob::gpu_data()` in Caffe), since the values stored at GPU can not be directly used in host code.\r\n    4. BTW, why the [`inputs()`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/8302/files#diff-6e6adac74a85b946a9a8ac6e5875e20aR232) in the `BatchNormGradCompute()` have the length of 11 and the [`in_data_start`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/8302/files#diff-6e6adac74a85b946a9a8ac6e5875e20aR235) equals 3?\r\n2. As for operator with learnable parameters,\r\n    1. I have checked out the convolution implementation files. The only thing I find is that the `weight` and `bias` are treated similarly to the `data` as one of the operator inputs. But what exactly is it that distinguishes between input data and operator parameters (so that the program knows the parameters need to be stored and updated)?\r\n    2. In the convolution implementation, `FResourceRequest` is used to claim one extra resource needed. If I need multiple resources, what should I do? Should I just return a longer resource request vector and define more values in the `ConvolutionOpResource` enum as below?\r\n```\r\nenum ConvolutionOpResource { kTempSpace1, kTempSpace2, kTempSpace2 };\r\n...\r\n.set_attr<FResourceRequest>(\"FResourceRequest\", [](const NodeAttrs& n) {\r\n  return std::vector<ResourceRequest>{ ResourceRequest::kTempSpace, ResourceRequest::kTempSpace, ResourceRequest::kTempSpace };\r\n})\r\n```\r\n3. As for the macros, I can checkout their definitions on my own. But I hope there are some clear explanations and examples telling me when I should use them. This allows users to start to develop their own code more quickly. In Caffe, I know I only need to use one `CUDA_KERNEL_LOOP` macro in most cases. But in MXNet, I feel totally blank, not knowing whether I should look for and use macros. It would be low efficient if each developer needs to examine all the macro definitions on their own.\r\n    - The [beginner guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/docs/how_to/add_op_in_backend.md) shows usages of `MSHADOW_TYPE_SWITCH`, `MXNET_ASSIGN_REQ_SWITCH` and `KERNEL_ASSIGN`. The former two can be easily understood, while the last one seems to only suit simple computations. In more complex computations, one will have pre-processings (e.g. computing sizes of intermediate variables and allocate memory dynamically), multiple callings of different CUDA kernel functions, post-processings, etc.\r\n4. Can my own code be put in completely separate locations? For example, the MXNet codebase lies at `<root>/<sub_root_1>/mxnet`, and I want to put my own code at `<root>/<sub_root_2>/<my_own_code_dir>`.\r\n5.

I've seen libgfortran.so.3 offered as a compat package on some distribution (iirc Amazon Linux) and I was hoping I could suggest that as a fix.  However the only compat version on Fedora 27 seems to be compat-libgfortran-41 which gets you libgfortran.so.1 and libgfortran.so.4 (neither of which work for mxnet).  Looks like the ABI changed, so I can't think of any way to link to both in the same package off the top of my head.
