thats correct. they are lexicographically sorted if you notice. \r\n\r\nThis is a trick we used at Uber even before Hudi. It helps layout data initially sorted, so range pruning is faster, and also when dealing with partitions with unequal size, the sort based on partitionpath ensures we are writing the smallest number of files in total. otherwise, if you hash partition 1000 times across 1000 partition paths, you ll end up with 1M files. In this approach, you will end up with atmost 2000 files. huge benefit. and from there on, when doing upserts/inserts, Hudi will maintain the file sizes.
