guess the root problem here is we aren't able to use a higher-level language construct to describe the memory layout since we are serializing/deserializing. because of that, we're casting and can't

using -Werror with apps/bundle_deploy in master right now, we should probably turn that on and clean up all the warnings in a future

LGTM! Could you also share the compilation time impact of hummingbird by tuning this option? Thanks!\r\n\r\nIt's hard to say. I've only tested on my laptop, but without this change (unbounded fuse depth) I cannot compile for even a tiny dataset of size (20, 10) in 1 hour. Compiling for a real world dataset is infeasible.\r\n\r\nWith configurable depth, the time it takes to run `relay.build` on the dataset of size (20, 10) is roughly:\r\n* max fuse depth = 15: 1 sec\r\n* max fuse depth = 50: 10 sec\r\n\r\nNote that with this change, fusion is no longer a problem for compiling hummingbird models, no matter what the dataset size is. I can now compile for the dataset of size (500, 10), but (1000, 10) gives a segfault for a different reason not related to fusion.

Some highlights include:\n>\n> - A successful developer conference that we are continuing to host this year\n> - Great community growth, as of now, the community contains 16 PPMC members, 31 committers, from a diverse list of organizations. We are actively growing the list monthly.\n> - Active contributions: ~ 150 PRs merged each month.\n>\n> The community has produced two formal apache releases. While we could also wait until more releases. We feel that the community is mature enough that we can push for graduation as it is, and continue to push for high quality releases concurrently.\n>\n> For reference, we also put together a maturity evaluation doc[2] under the Apache maturity model.\n>\n> Some additional note about the resolution below: the current PPMC will be transitioned to the PMC.

I'm so excited for this! I'll do a deep dive today\r\n\r\nThere are a number tests in tests/python/relay/dyn that skip running on GPU while waiting for this feature, i.e. https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/blob/942c90ba7a7b9bccf6d9bce43808aba2bd6c9787/tests/python/relay/dyn/test_dynamic_op_level3.py#L30-L31\r\n\r\nDo you want to enable those as part of this test? Or I can do it as a second PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/680957809/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/680959658","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6335#issuecomment-680959658","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6335","id":680959658,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4MDk1OTY1OA==","user":{"login":"mbaret","id":55580676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTgwNjc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55580676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret","html_url":"https://github.com/mbaret","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-26T15:41:20Z","updated_at":"2020-08-26T15:41:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"cc @masahi @comaniac @zhiics @Leo-arm ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/680959658/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/680967384","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6316#issuecomment-680967384","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6316","id":680967384,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4MDk2NzM4NA==","user":{"login":"mbrookhart","id":4065489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNjU0ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4065489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart","html_url":"https://github.com/mbrookhart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-26T15:54:36Z","updated_at":"2020-08-26T15:54:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@yongwww @electriclilies Can you take another look?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/680967384/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
