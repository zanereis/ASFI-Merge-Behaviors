And I've noticed that it looks like happening with heavy projetcs (containing lots of files, including bunch of assets).\r\n\r\nSo I closed heavy projects, restarted IDE with 2 light projetcs. It opened projects, scanned background and checked for external changes: and then, when there is none progress bars pending, it seems it's working normally.\r\n\r\nNice to have this clue, thanks to you, but now how I can deal with heavy projects ? Should I limit the scan to certain extensions ? (Im not using github inside netbeans, so i don't need to check for changes on images, and assets). Or is this scan already limited to scripts and then what do you suggest (i use sometimes \"ignored folders\", not enough maybe) ? I must insist on the fact that these heavy projects never \"crashed\" earlier versions of netbeans i've used (and i use it since 15 years).

You have to check licenses and notices anyway, so changing our integration only slightly lightens the burden. The files are also not all equal:\r\n\r\n- `*-licenses.txt`, `*-notice.txt`: They need to be check on _every_ update\r\n- `binaries-list`: covers downloads, nothing more. These might be bundled libraries, but often enough they are also compile time dependencies that are not bundled\r\n- `project.properties`: References files that are to be copied by the build system. These are not necessarily downloaded, but also could be part of regular sources\r\n- `project.xml`: The project file is independed of the build system, but tied to the ant based project type, so we can't tie it to the binaries list\r\n- `build.xml`: This is highly dependend on the project type. Some project rebundle files or fix issues in downloaded binaries, so little sharing there\r\n- `ignoried-overlaps`: Well, we can discuss whether or not this helps\r\n- `binariesembedded-list`: If I remember correctly this is, so that we don't push our binaries to maven central and instead reference the maven bits.\r\n\r\nSo all in, there is little to gain and the referenced (embedded maven) is very near a worst case scenario. Yes it is not nice, but also less painful, than changing the bits, that make up this net.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hashes in `binaries-list` have to stay as they double as integrity checks.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the need is to create a list of all URLs that would be downloaded, it would IMHO better to create  a task for that in the build system, as that would also be able to consider the cluster that is being build and thus giving \"the right\" list.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1544561716/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1544593274","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/5934#issuecomment-1544593274","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5934","id":1544593274,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5cEJ96","user":{"login":"lkishalmi","id":1381701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODE3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1381701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi","html_url":"https://github.com/lkishalmi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-11T19:56:44Z","updated_at":"2023-05-11T19:57:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Well, when `Compile on Save` is enabled it adds some quirks how the IDE interacts with the project, so you might loose some \"functionality\".

I could try to remove all the single import logic related to PSR12 just to reduce maintenance cost (it still should work good enough if USES were formatted properly by user before an import).
