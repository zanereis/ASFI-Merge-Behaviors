I believe the issue I'm having is due to the fact that my topics have more than one key : value to store, since it's a more complex topic with JSON (and I also tested with Avro) schema.\r\n\r\nI think that sort of invalidates my issue's main point. It might make sense to have an example of more complex storage with the Cassandra sink rather than a single key and column, but that can be moved to a different issue (or, I suppose, a feature request) in the future.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/744702575/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/744710238","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/8952#issuecomment-744710238","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/8952","id":744710238,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0NDcxMDIzOA==","user":{"login":"jianyun8023","id":18240360,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MjQwMzYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18240360?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jianyun8023","html_url":"https://github.com/jianyun8023","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jianyun8023/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jianyun8023/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jianyun8023/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jianyun8023/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jianyun8023/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jianyun8023/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jianyun8023/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jianyun8023/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jianyun8023/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-14T21:05:53Z","updated_at":"2020-12-14T21:05:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"/pulsarbot

some digging on this.  The issue is because the certs array is null, and that's null because Java threw a `SSLPeerUnverifiedException` which the getter caught and ate (and returned null).  I'd argue that's confusing and a log line should be added where that exception is eaten so it's obvious at least _why_ the connection is being refused (or even don't eat that exception at all, and just bubble it back to the caller; it will just NRE on it anyhow currently).\r\n\r\nAfter checking our trust store configurations, everything seemed to be valid, so why Java would not trust our client certificate is another mystery.  One thing we changed which we are currently testing as a workaround is we changed the broker's `tlsRequireTrustedClientCertOnConnect` from false to true.  With it set to true, a test that was persistently failing before now succeeds, but it's non-obvious from the setting or documentation that such a setting should be required for client certs to work at all.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/746874435/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/746974629","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/8967#issuecomment-746974629","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/8967","id":746974629,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0Njk3NDYyOQ==","user":{"login":"hpvd","id":5681880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODE4ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5681880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hpvd","html_url":"https://github.com/hpvd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hpvd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hpvd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hpvd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hpvd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hpvd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hpvd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hpvd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hpvd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hpvd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-16T20:37:02Z","updated_at":"2020-12-16T20:37:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"related
