I think we are good with all changes as suggested. But I had a question though on QueryAzureDataExplorer. Since it mandatorily requires a flow file to query into ADX, can this processor become a starting point of a flow where we query into ADX using input query and write the output to a file or some other output processor?\r\n\r\nYou're welcome, and thanks for the follow-up @tanmaya-panda1.\r\n\r\nRegarding the required input FlowFile, you are right that the updated approach changes the behavior to require some other starting point Processor, such as GenerateFlowFile, as an input to QueryAzureDataExplorer. This behavior could be restored, but I wanted to clarify the intended use case first.\r\n\r\nOther \"source\" Processors, such as the List Processors, use state tracking to provide a query approach that only brings in new information. Without that tracking in this Processor, it would be necessary to write a query with a relative boundary, or using NiFi Expression Language to compute the current time, for example. The same result could be achieved using `GenerateFlowFile` in front of this Processor, but I understand that it introduces an additional step in the data flow. If you can provide some additional details on how you expected to use this Processor as a standalone source, that would be helpful in determining the best path forward.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1600758257/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1600888182","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/7414#issuecomment-1600888182","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/7414","id":1600888182,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5fa512","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-21T13:58:11Z","updated_at":"2023-06-21T13:58:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mr1716 I adjusted the spacing for the two example HTML outputs to match the serialization changes in Saxon 12.2.

In my mind, they are logically connected, especially in this case. Purely from the user's point of view, I think it would be better to put these fields into the FileResourceService, though I understand it is not possible as it resides in a separate module. Tbh, I don't have a good idea to solve it atm, but I wanted to point it out. \r\n\r\nThanks for the feedback and testing @nandorsoma! I pushed an update that removes two utility methods and instead uses the functional `Optional.map().orElse()` approach. This seems more natural under the circumstances.\r\n\r\nThis optional approach to file transfer is somewhat outside the bounds of normal processing, given that the `StandardFileResourceService` allows reading directly from the file system, so I understand how the property organization may not be the most intuitive. The correct configuration does require aligning the Service `File Path` with the expected input values on a given FlowFile, but that seems reasonable given that standard usage patterns will not make use of this feature. There could be room for improvement in subsequent iterations, but at least the current approach avoids introducing new permission restrictions on the existing
