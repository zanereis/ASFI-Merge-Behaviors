[Solarium](https://github.com/solariumphp/solarium) aims at accurately modelling Solr by providing a fluent interface to build queries and parsing the results to PHP objects. The implementation for API requests is currently generic and just gets you the output from Solr as an array.\r\n\r\n> Isn't there a library, which don't feel so unique about keys?\r\n\r\nThere is, and I'm already using it to parse that particular piece of JSON. There are two things at play for me:\r\n* Solarium supports JSON and PHPS output since before I was using it. I'm trying not to break that. (If Solr deprecates PHPS, that's a different story of course.)\r\n* I was curious how parsing it would compare performance wise.\r\n\r\n> Remember `json.nl` parameter options\r\n\r\nThat is for `NamedList`s, the \"offending\" data structure is a `SimpleOrderedMap` and those aren't affected by `json.nl`.\r\n\r\n> the actual API response, in JSON, is outputting invalid JSON.\r\n\r\nTechnically, it isn't. ECMA-404 doesn't say anything about it. [RFC 8259](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8259#section-4) says names SHOULD be unique, not MUST. But you can see how this becomes a nuisance when decoding to a language that has no internal data structure that allows duplicate keys.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1841669328/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1841762567","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2114#issuecomment-1841762567","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2114","id":1841762567,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5txxEH","user":{"login":"dsmiley","id":377295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzI5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/377295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley","html_url":"https://github.com/dsmiley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-05T22:57:24Z","updated_at":"2023-12-05T22:57:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sorry; I wasn't paying enough attention.

With this change, the test passes even if I change `localhost` to `localhost.localdomain` in my `/etc/hosts` file.  (I am trying this as a modest attempt to mimic the environmental conditions when it fails in our CI.)  However, carefully consider the changes I am making to `JWTIssuerConfig.java`.  Here I am assuming the host name check bypass for `localhost` exists merely to help unit tests with self-signed certificates.  Perhaps we are also helping users who try this functionality on their laptops?  I think with my change it will work for either case, but maybe we also want to exempt `InetAddress.getLoopbackAddress().getHostName()` as well (as far as I can tell this will always return `localhost`).\r\n\r\nIt would be much better if we could use the Mock library's self-signed certificate generation, as you suggest.

A value of \"-1\" could be used to differentiate.\r\n\r\nI used this as an indirect indicator that the init part is completed. metrics do not increase open count, they only expose some lazy computations which can trigger the deadlocking flow. as far as I can read this code the 'open count > 1' (strictly bigger) signals the 'open' method has been called, which is post-init phase. I find the 'open count = 1 by default' confusing too but I avoided messing around too much with it because that was not the core issue being addressed.\r\n\r\nthe way I understand it:\r\n - init phase -- open count = 1\r\n - \"open\" / \"close\" calls will increase and decrease open count\r\n - final 'close' will set open count to 0 and actually perform resource cleanup (doClose)\r\n\r\nIf the open count is not to your liking (I am not married to it, it was just a proposal) I think you had some thoughts on alternatives. it's just a matter of getting the timing right for the concurrent calls to the metrics, where simply moving the code below a few lines is not sufficient.\r\n\r\n> There are no validations for, say, \"segments\" (exposed as INDEX.segments), but if you look at the response in a debugger, there is a null value.
