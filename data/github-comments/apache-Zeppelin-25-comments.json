If that repeats - will file the jira issue with label 'flaky-test'.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/161505737/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/161514669","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/497#issuecomment-161514669","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/497","id":161514669,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MTUxNDY2OQ==","user":{"login":"bzz","id":5582506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1ODI1MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5582506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz","html_url":"https://github.com/bzz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-03T04:58:46Z","updated_at":"2015-12-03T04:59:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Have addressed all the reviews, please let me know if something is missing.\n\nIn 5d7ffea  `.close()` lifecycle method was introduced for the `NotebookRero` to cleanup the resources that storage implementation might have occupied.\nAs this is an API change \\cc @khalidhuseynov and @Leemoonsoo who worked on this before, as I recall, to take a quick look.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/161514669/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/161515202","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/489#issuecomment-161515202","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/489","id":161515202,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MTUxNTIwMg==","user":{"login":"astroshim","id":3348133,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDgxMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3348133?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/astroshim","html_url":"https://github.com/astroshim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astroshim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astroshim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astroshim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astroshim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astroshim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astroshim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astroshim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astroshim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astroshim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-03T05:03:28Z","updated_at":"2015-12-03T05:03:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bzz Okay.
