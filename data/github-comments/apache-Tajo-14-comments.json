for all your valuable reviews. I'll commit shortly.\n\n@sirpkt, I also think that the selection should be pushed down to after the first join. This will improve the query performance. \nTo resolve this problem, I think that we need to add another filter pushdown optimization phase after join ordering. Please note that the filter pushdown phase is currently called only before join ordering.\nAfter join ordering, the best position of each predicate will be differernt. So, it seems the problem of our query optimization rather than just a problem of filter pushdown. I'll create another issue.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/86791563/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/86808708","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/423#issuecomment-86808708","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/423","id":86808708,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2ODA4NzA4","user":{"login":"hyunsik","id":225941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/225941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik","html_url":"https://github.com/hyunsik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-27T03:50:11Z","updated_at":"2015-03-27T03:50:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Didn't we agree to put this feature to master branch during SNAPSHOT in order to find aggressively hidden bugs?

You make new EvalNode Type `PYTHON_FUNCTION`. But, it may be not matched to the design of EvalNode, and it will require duplicated codes for EvalNode visitors.\n\nYou seem to do because Python function involcation is different from existing Java function. I think that the best solution is to separate EvalNode and Function Invocation code. In more detail, you should implement some function invocation interface, and separate java function invocation and python function invocation.  Each function invocation implementation can be initialized at the first function call, or you can use EvalNode::Bind(), being addressed in TAJO-1436.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/87281813/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/87399705","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/473#issuecomment-87399705","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/473","id":87399705,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3Mzk5NzA1","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-29T11:32:21Z","updated_at":"2015-03-29T11:32:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@hyunsik, thanks for the nice suggestion. It is definitely a better solution.\nHowever, I have a different opinion on detailed implementation. \nThe first option that initialize each function invocation implementation at the first function call is deprecated, so it is not a good choice.\nAnd the second option using EvalNode::Bind() seems to initialize schema-dependent variables. Even though we still can change the specification of TAJO-1436, the current one looks good. Since relations have different schemas, schema-dependent variables should be initialized for each schema. \n\nHowever, function invocation implementation does not depend on relations' schema. I think that it would be better to initialize when an instance of `FunctionEval` is created.\nWhat do you
