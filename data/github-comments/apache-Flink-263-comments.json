I also agree that updating `KeyFunctions.appendKeyExtractor()` can fix this issue, easily and effectively. However, it seems not to be a graceful, or say, an untimate solution. \r\n\r\nI think the main problem is whether we take the Union operator as a special one without parallelism (your solution) or a common operator whose parallelism is forcibly set to the larger one of its inputs (my solution). IMO, the drawback of the former solution is that we may need to add more Union-specific logic in the future, while the drawback of the later one is that I'm not sure setting the parallelism like that can really solve the problem once for all. Anyway, we should forbid the users to set the parallelism for Union since it does not take effect.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/411458158/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/411464535","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6003#issuecomment-411464535","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6003","id":411464535,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMTQ2NDUzNQ==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-08T16:16:36Z","updated_at":"2018-08-08T16:16:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @xccui, in principle uniform handling of operators is a very good idea!\r\n\r\nHowever, union is a special operator, because there is no Union runtime operator. An operator that consumes from Union will simply multiplex all unioned inputs. Hence, the parallelism of the (non-existing) union is the parallelism of its successor. Since there is already quite a bit of custom code for union operators, I'm a bit afraid that your fix might cause problems in some corner cases.\r\n\r\nAnother benefit of my approach is that the key extractors can be chained to the previous operators. This is not the case if the extractor is applied on the unioned result. \r\n\r\nBest, Fabian","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/411464535/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/411465120","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6494#issuecomment-411465120","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6494","id":411465120,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMTQ2NTEyMA==","user":{"login":"yanghua","id":2283778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODM3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2283778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua","html_url":"https://github.com/yanghua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-08T16:18:24Z","updated_at":"2018-08-08T16:18:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"thanks @hequn8128 , updated this PR~","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/411465120/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/411472064","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6003#issuecomment-411472064","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6003","id":411472064,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMTQ3MjA2NA==","user":{"login":"xccui","id":1452518,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NTI1MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1452518?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xccui","html_url":"https://github.com/xccui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xccui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xccui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xccui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xccui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xccui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xccui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xccui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xccui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xccui/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-08T16:39:35Z","updated_at":"2018-08-08T16:39:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for the explanation @fhueske.

@yanghua, I think your approach goes in the right direction. Extending `ActorSystemImpl` allows us to set a custom uncaught exception handler. It is a bit tricky since we have to put our own `RobustActorSystem` in the same package as `ActorSystemImpl`. But I think this is ok since it only affects a single class. I've taken your work and extended it a bit in #6539 (second commit).

Also in the PR description, I explained that it passed my local test. I originally wanted to write a test case. This PR change is mainly for `GlobalConfiguration`. I have already seen it. Flink didn't test `flink-conf.yaml` before, and it doesn't seem to provide the infrastructure for this kind of test. The configuration-related tests are all about creating a Configuration object yourself and then setting values for it.\r\n\r\nIf Flink's original code already contains tests for this configuration file path, I can write tests. Next I will add some test case for the added methods themselves.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the original purpose of this issue is not to think that the configuration of the history server will disturb other configurations in the flink-conf, but that it can appear as a separate component, so it can be isolated into a separate file.

For this I'd like to use `javadocs_baseurl` instead of adding more instances of the problematic, hardcoded url.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/412457009/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/412457049","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6536#issuecomment-412457049","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6536","id":412457049,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMjQ1NzA0OQ==","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-13T09:16:02Z","updated_at":"2018-08-13T09:16:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"but the scripts aren't adjusted to update the link, so for the next release branch this will be broken again.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/412457049/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/412462655","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6536#issuecomment-412462655","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6536","id":412462655,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMjQ2MjY1NQ==","user":{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-13T09:37:39Z","updated_at":"2018-08-13T09:37:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The scripts never worked because they are not applied on the `release-X` branch, i.e. not on `release-1.6`. `update_release_branch` is applied on master, where it also doesn't work.
