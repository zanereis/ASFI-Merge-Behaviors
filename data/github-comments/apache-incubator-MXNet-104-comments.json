For example, in the rcnn example, the images are all resized to a shorter size of 600px, so basically the sizes are (~600, ~600), but they are **all different sizes**, so this leads to a collapse of the program, since (600, 600), (600,601), (600,602)...(600, xxxx) will all be individually allocated.

norm在lstm上应用的文章， 并且做了一下试验，发现了一个问题：\n例如使用unrolled lstm， 序列长度为m， 对lstm的输入数据做batchnorm， 则对应m个batchnorm， batchnorm在初始化的时候可以指定gamma和beta 两个symbol，因此可以控制这m个batch norm都使用同一组gamma和beta参数，可是对于aux_states， 却仍然有m组， 因为目前在batch norm初始化的时候无法指定aux_states。
