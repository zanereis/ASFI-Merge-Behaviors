is an interesting problem that raises up. This was due to the usage of shared_ptr inside the symbol and the deletion triggered a chain of shared_ptr deletions, where the recursion of delete function call piles up and causes stack overflow. \n\nLike @sxjscience said, remove the delete of symbol might be a good temp solution to go. We will think of better alternatives for a safer destruction.\n\nThanks for finding this interesting case. Also  cc @mavenlin since it is interesting thing we need to address in pressure testing the graph.
