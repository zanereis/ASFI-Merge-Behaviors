When acquiring the lock we do conditional puts to validate that no other entity is holding the lock, or in the case where there is an existing lock found in the eventual consistent read, we validate via the conditional put that it's not a different lease id than expected. Could we elaborate on the case by giving an example timeline where where an eventual consistent read of the lock will lead to a correctness issue in different entities trying to grab the lock.\r\n\r\nThe case that comes to mind is we read an outdated version and then in the conditional put to acquire the lock we fail to acquire it since the versions are different. Perhaps in streaming workloads where the lock is repeatedly getting acquired and released, there's also a chance that the version is out dated due to eventual consistency; but in those cases the strong consistent read may lead to longer times to acquire the lock as opposed to maybe failing faster on the put? I'll need to think more on the tradeoff here I suppose.\r\n\r\n2.) Considering Dynamo locking was originally built due to a lack of optimistic locking support from Glue, I am not sure how many new users would use this locking support and so we may not want to add to it unless there's a correctness issue in the locking (1); if there's a correctness issue, definitely makes sense to fix that.\r\n\r\nSo in short, if there's a correctness issue in terms of acquiring the lock due to the eventual consistent read, makes sense and would be nice to see an example timeline of systems grabbing the lock.\r\n\r\nIf it's more for reducing the chance of failure on the conditional put, would want to make sure it's a change that existing users for DDB Lock manager would benefit from in their workload considering new users could just use GlueCatalog and optimistic locking.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1126509083/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1126564730","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4727#issuecomment-1126564730","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4727","id":1126564730,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85DJgN6","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-13T22:59:43Z","updated_at":"2022-05-13T22:59:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks,

Also in the case we did a GET and found that the record was stale, this includes a sleep of 15 sec ([by default](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/CatalogProperties.java#L67-L68)), before making the PUT which will eventually fail with ConditionalCheckFailedException.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/f85366269a37a960bc05a481c41ea1af5df01d83/aws/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/aws/dynamodb/DynamoDbLockManager.java#L215-L220\r\n\r\n> but in those cases the strong consistent read may lead to longer times to acquire the lock\r\n\r\nI agree, strong consistent can be less performant than eventual consistent read in terms of latency, I didn't find a public doc bench-marking the two API's, can share a data point though we did an internal benchmark a while back in a high write dynamo table the max we were hurt were in p90 by double digit in ms (though I would take this with a pinch of salt, as it's highly dependent on your workload). Also this is something [DDBCatalog](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/master/aws/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/aws/dynamodb/DynamoDbCatalog.java#L164) already uses \r\n\r\n> as opposed to maybe failing faster on the put\r\n\r\nIn case we read a stale entry we don't fail fast via put condition check, we wait for the lease to expire which could be 15 sec by default , this time gap is much much greater than what we could expect our consistent read is gonna add.\r\n\r\n> If it's more for reducing the chance of failure on the conditional put, would want to make sure it's a change that existing users for DDB Lock manager\r\n\r\n[HadoopCatalog](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/hadoop/HadoopCatalog.java#L113) also uses lockManager so a user using (Hadoop + DDB as lock manager) could certainly benefit.\r\n\r\n > considering new users could just use GlueCatalog and optimistic locking\r\n\r\nThere was interesting discussion a while back on deprecating lockManager requirement for Glue, but from @rdblue's [comment](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4166#issuecomment-1112636936) looks like we decided to keep this.\r\n\r\nAll in all I would say, I do see some value in doing this, let me WDYT considering the above.

If parsing gets failed in [BaseMetastoreTableOperations](https://iceberg.apache.org/javadoc/0.13.1/index.html?org/apache/iceberg/BaseMetastoreTableOperations.html) then the file can be in File-System-Tables spec and we can reparse the file using File-System-Tables spec.\r\n\r\n2.)
