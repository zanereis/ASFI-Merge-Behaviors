I'm starting to become e bit skeptic about this proposal. Surely it will add some overhead and since this is a critical code I agree that it should be avoid as much at possible. \r\n\r\nFor this reason I was thinking about a possible alternative. What about instead to make the default toString and equals strategy configurable via service loader (or even a system property). This would have several benefits: \r\n\r\n1) no extra reflective overhead \r\n2) no need for a new annotation in the groovy code\r\n3) user provided strategy could rely on more performant implementation eg (use of marker interface instead of annotation) \r\n4) would be easier to remove in a future groovy release if this feature would be implemented/handled at core level as a language feature. \r\n\r\nWhat do you think about that?

Any thread can access any field at any time and between the moment a field is assigned a variable of some type in a method and the time is is used the line after, another thread may have changed the contents of the field. This is not the case for local variables: we know if they \"escape\" or not, so we can make sure that the type of a variable is constant (or not) over time. Note that even if a field is final, the JVM makes no guarantee about it, so the type checker doesn’t behave differently if a field is final or not.\r\n\r\n/cc @melix @paulk-asert ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/389188098/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/389263857","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/706#issuecomment-389263857","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/706","id":389263857,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4OTI2Mzg1Nw==","user":{"login":"paulk-asert","id":280016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MDAxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/280016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert","html_url":"https://github.com/paulk-asert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-15T18:17:30Z","updated_at":"2018-05-15T18:17:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yes, the pre-existing behavior is by design.

But that's not how it is, so we cannot treat it as such. Let me give examples:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef map = [:]\r\nmap[123] = \"Hello $world\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen pass it to Java code. What should it see in the map ? A `String` ? A `GString` ? If it's a string, then it needs to be coerced as soon as it is put into the map. If it's a GString, then you're exposing it as a public API, and it means that it needs not to be coerced when you get it from the map. If so, why would you coerce the key but not the value? What if I write this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef map = [:]\r\nmap[123] = \"some $thing\"\r\nprintln(map[123].strings) // 1\r\ndef x = map[123] // 2\r\nString x = map[123] // 3\r\nGString x = map[123] // 4\r\n```\r\n1 should always work, because what we have put in the map is a GString, so we shouldn't coerce.\r\n2 should also return a GString\r\n3 uses explicit coercion, so you're asking for the evaluation of the GString\r\n4 is explicitly typed, and nothing happens\r\n\r\nIt's all valid scenarios. So handling coercion for methods is one thing (coerce to a String when you have a method that takes a String), but handling them as a single object everywhere is another. This issue is about handling the coercion of a special \"hidden\" method call (`getAt(String)`) and is as such a bit special, I agree, but it doesn't mean we can do coercion everywhere.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/389764202/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/389779622","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/708#issuecomment-389779622","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/708","id":389779622,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4OTc3OTYyMg==","user":{"login":"daniellansun","id":9151616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxNTE2MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9151616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun","html_url":"https://github.com/daniellansun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-17T07:59:33Z","updated_at":"2018-05-17T07:59:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@melix `\"Hello $world\"` seems to be evaluated eagerly.
