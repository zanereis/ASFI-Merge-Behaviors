For methods that create znodes in ZkUtils, instead of passing an instance of `ZkClient` I pass an instance of `ZkClientContext`, which contains an instance of `ZkClient`, the implementation of `isSecure`, and `DefaultAcls` (I moved the latter two from `ZkUtils`). The calls in `ZkUtils` ended up looking like this:\n\n```\nprivate def createParentPath(client: ZkClientContext, path: String)(acls: List[ACL] = client.DefaultAcls): Unit\n```\n\nNote that I've split the list of parameters into two, so that I could change the default ACL. I don't find the syntax super cute, but it works. To instantiate `ZkClientContext`, I require a parameter for the `java.security.auth.login.config` property so that `isSecure` executes properly. As I was trying to do this, a problem I came across is that in the`kafka.admin` package, we are making calls to ZkUtils due to command line execution. In such cases, it isn't clear how we will enforce that the command sets the login config property so that we declare the calls to `ZkUtils` secure. In general, the main problem I came across as I was making changes was exactly determining what the current configuration is. \n\nBut, let's go by parts. First, I'm interested in knowing if you find the above approach acceptable. Second, even without the approach above, how are you planning on enforcing that the calls via command line are executed securely?\n\nHope it makes sense.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/146883466/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/146886317","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/256#issuecomment-146886317","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/256","id":146886317,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0Njg4NjMxNw==","user":{"login":"rhauch","id":84732,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NzMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84732?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch","html_url":"https://github.com/rhauch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-09T14:25:51Z","updated_at":"2015-10-09T14:25:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@guozhangwang, rebased this PR.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/146886317/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/146934868","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/290#issuecomment-146934868","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/290","id":146934868,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NjkzNDg2OA==","user":{"login":"ewencp","id":47366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp","html_url":"https://github.com/ewencp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-09T17:11:12Z","updated_at":"2015-10-09T17:11:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Could we also add a unit test for `leastLoadedNode`'s behavior?

\nThe default with security on is `CREATOR_ALL` which means that only zk clients with the right credentials will be able to create children in the kafka subtree or modify nodes in that tree. If the client running something from the command line doesn't pass the right credentials, then the default will be `OPEN`, but it doesn't matter because of the acls already in zookeeper. Is that a correct assessment? Will you add `makeSureCorrectAcls`?\n\nAbout the `ZkClientContext` discussion, I'd like to reach an agreement on what to do about the fact that we are reading a configuration parameter from a static object. What I proposed does increase the number of changes and the files it touches. The current PR is much nicer in this sense because all changes are in `ZkUtils`. But, it sounds like we need a better way of controlling the behavior of the calls in `ZkUtils`. I'm not sure we can do it without changes in other classes, but I'm open to suggestions.

Convert the object into a class so that parameters can be passed during instantiation\n2. Use an implicit parameter in the object methods to pass a context object implicitly\n\n@fpj's proposal is a variation of two that moves `ZkClient` into the context object (which makes sense) and doesn't make the parameter implicit (which is up for discussion I think).\n\nIf my arguments have not been convincing enough, then we could keep the singleton and change the `isSecured` val to a var that could be changed from tests only. I personally seriously dislike this approach, but I mention it because @junrao said that it could be OK if the ability to change `isSecured` was only needed for tests.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/147087066/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/147102424","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/93#issuecomment-147102424","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/93","id":147102424,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NzEwMjQyNA==","user":{"login":"junrao","id":132330,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjMzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/132330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-10T16:05:39Z","updated_at":"2015-10-10T16:05:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The current patch seems to work well for a new cluster. If ZK credential is set properly in the brokers, the top level paths will be created to only allow authenticated clients to create child nodes. If some one runs the acl cli w/o ZK credential, the command will fail.\n\nIf there is already an existing cluster, we have to think through the upgrade path. I am not sure adding the support of makeSureCorrectAcls in ZkUtils is ideal. Suppose you do that and do a rolling upgrade. After the first broker is upgraded, the acl for existing ZK paths will be set and the rest of the brokers won't be able to write to ZK any more. This can be problematic since the rest of the brokers may need to write to ZK for doing controller related stuff, for changing ISRs, for creating new topics, etc. \n\nOne alternative is the following. We introduce a broker config set.zookeeper.acl, which defaults to false. ZK acls will only be set if set.zookeeper.acl is true. We also make a separate ZKSecurityMigrationTool that will take the ZK credential and set the acl on all existing ZK paths managed by Kafka. To do the upgrade, we (1) rolling restart all Kafka brokers to pass in the ZK credential (after this step, all brokers can read from ZK if acl is set, but they are not setting the acl yet); (2) do a second rolling restart of all brokers by setting set.zookeeper.acl to true (after this step, new ZK paths will be created with acl); (3) run ZKSecurityMigrationTool to set acl on all existing ZK paths. After this point, ZK is secured. Nobody can change the data in ZK w/o ZK credential. Will that work? If this works, we will probably need to make ZkUtils a class so that we can pass in the config set.zookeeper.acl.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/147102424/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/147113968","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/293#issuecomment-147113968","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/293","id":147113968,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NzExMzk2OA==","user":{"login":"ewencp","id":47366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp","html_url":"https://github.com/ewencp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-10T18:22:30Z","updated_at":"2015-10-10T18:22:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yes, just did a manual check with `ps` and a bit of `grep` and `wc`.

However, given the current structure of `ZkUtils`, I find it more elegant to introduce an extended zk context rather than making them all class methods. But again, I believe we can get the same functionality we need both ways and the amount of changes seems to be roughly the same.\n\nOn the issue of rolling upgrades (good point!), the approach described sounds good, but I think we can avoid the second rolling start by using a `/kafka/issecured` znode or some other name like that. During the rolling restart, we set `set.zookeeper.acl` on all brokers and they set a watch on that znode. Once the znode is created, brokers start using credentials.

Technically we don't need a root key. We could actually handle each connector's tasks independently, e.g. after writing the updated configs, just have a `connector-tasks-commit` type record. So if we had a connector called foo, instead of rewriting the root record, we could just write `connector-tasks-foo` that just contains the # of tasks that should now be used.\n\nI think it's a bit messier to keep track of and you don't have one place you can look to see what the current state of tasks should be, but it's a bit simpler to understand and decouples certain updates (where we need to make sure we have consistent configs for all connector tasks).

I have attached the API level tests. Sorry for the delay. \n\nThere are 3 things that are still pending because of which you will see some TODOs and commented code in the PR:\n\n1) Both producer and consumer side seem to hide server side exception when they fail to get Metadata. Consumer is kind of worst as it tries infinitely. Really no way to test that we actually got authorization exception or not. Shouldn't they stop retrying for nonRetriable exception types?\n\n2) For APIs where we just throw an exception instead of sending a response back, the client does not really get any response. In the original PR I think we made the change under the assumption that when the API layer throws the exception the RequestHandler will somehow translate that into a response but that is not happening. I think it is better to just send a response back to the client.\n\n3) This is unrelated to PR TODOs but I was looking at the https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-11+-+Authorization+Interface#KIP-11-AuthorizationInterface-Operation and as seen in the table operations like LeaderAndIsr, StopReplica and UpdateMetadata were defined as ClusterAction at topic level. In the current code all of these are defined as ClusterAction at Cluster level. I don't know if this was changed as part of KIP discussion, PR comments or its just a complete miss on my end. I wanted to point this out and ensure that we want these operations to be authorized at cluster level with ClusterAction operation and not do what is listed in the KIP.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/147548411/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/147550028","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/165#issuecomment-147550028","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/165","id":147550028,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NzU1MDAyOA==","user":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-12T23:40:58Z","updated_at":"2015-10-12T23:40:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"A general comment:\n\nI feel adding this to the join-group to allow coordinator-side pre-checking would be OK, since although it adds an extra field in the join group request, it is not very hard to understand. But now the protocol field seems less useful to me given the group-id and sub-protocols, since we only use it to check all members use the same group-protocol string. But in practice how possible that members joining the same group name happen to be different types (e.g. one normal consumer and one copycat connector)? Having this field will not be so useful in excluding human-mistakes but even likely increase false-positives that two members that do belong to the same group got kicked out because they happen to specify different protocol names by mistake. \n\nSo I would suggest we remove the protocol string and rename sub-protocols to protocols, doing this we may end up having group ids like \"kafka-consumer-xxx\", \"kafka-stream-yyy\" and \"kafka-copycat-zzz\", which is already sufficient to differentiate different types of members.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/147550028/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/147550296","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/299#issuecomment-147550296","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/299","id":147550296,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NzU1MDI5Ng==","user":{"login":"gwenshap","id":1189030,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODkwMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1189030?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap","html_url":"https://github.com/gwenshap","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-12T23:43:19Z","updated_at":"2015-10-12T23:43:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @SinghAsDev, Thanks for the patch!\n\nI thought the plan was to add support for the new consumer with a flag, as we did for other tools and for the new producer.\nSomething like \"--new-consumer\".\n\nThe idea is that the new code is not fully tested yet and we want to give people the option to revert to old behavior if something goes wrong.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/147550296/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/147553915","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/274#issuecomment-147553915","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/274","id":147553915,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NzU1MzkxNQ==","user":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-13T00:13:48Z","updated_at":"2015-10-13T00:13:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Just realize now console_consumer.properties would become a dummy file again :)\n\nMy take is that the value of having a template file is to specify some universal config values that will be used across all test runs with probably different combinations of other config values; or universally use some pre-defined values from the framework setup. For example\n\ntests/kafkatest/services/templates/console_consumer.properties\n\nIf we do not have any value definitions in the template file (i.e. a file is empty / dummy), then appending different values to this file and use it for various test runs is no difference with creating a new file each run with different values on-the-fly. Hence I feel the empty file itself brings us no extra benefit for customizing test runs, and better be removed and creating new files for different runs instead. For now since we do not have customizable test runs using console consumer yet we can simply do the same as #271.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/147553915/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/147554120","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/271#issuecomment-147554120","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/271","id":147554120,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NzU1NDEyMA==","user":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-13T00:15:29Z","updated_at":"2015-10-13T00:15:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/147554120/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/147556600","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/299#issuecomment-147556600","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/299","id":147556600,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NzU1NjYwMA==","user":{"login":"SinghAsDev","id":4915557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MTU1NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4915557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghAsDev","html_url":"https://github.com/SinghAsDev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghAsDev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghAsDev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghAsDev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghAsDev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghAsDev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghAsDev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghAsDev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghAsDev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghAsDev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-13T00:29:29Z","updated_at":"2015-10-13T00:29:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@gwenshap got it.

This change will not effect that. This change only effects calls to the logger. It also does not prevent the information from being printed, but allows a user to redirect it in case they do not want it to effect the output (with `2>`). I don't suspect a user is writing their scripts to depend on logged output, however if they are they should still be able to.

This was just a particularly broad change since it affects every tool that does any logging via log4j, although as @granthenke points out that may not be that big a change since a lot of the tools just write directly to stdout.\n\n@granthenke Pointing out those other potential compatibility issues is very valuable, but 5 wrongs don't make a right :) Just because we may have missed other compatibility issues isn't an argument that adding more is ok.\n\nI'm fine with this change as long as we're convinced it doesn't affect anything that's likely to be critical. I just like to raise the compatibility issue whenever I notice it so we continue to pay attention to it. CLI is an especially difficult area because it's harder to warn users that may be using the CLI in automated ways. Unlike the Java code where you can add `@Deprecated` and they should see the warnings, the CLI changes can't be \"staged\" as easily.\n\nI think it'd be great to add a changelog for compatibility breaking changes.

It leads to the question of how we are going to implement protocol-specific metadata. There's basically two options:\n\n**Option 1:** Each protocol has its own metadata: this is probably the simplest to implement for client extensions. This would change the JoinGroup request to look something like this:\n\n```\nJoinGroupRequest => GroupId SessionTimeout MemberId Protocols\n  GroupId => String\n  SessionTimeout => int32\n  MemberId => String\n  Protocols => [Protocol MemberMetadata]\n    Protocol => String\n    MemberMetadata => Bytes\n```\n\nThe downside is that this leads to redundant data in the request. For example, to support both the round-robin and range assignors in the consumer (at the same time), you'd have to pass the subscription list twice. Perhaps this is a rare enough case that we aren't too worried about the overhead? It also leads to somewhat more complex parsing, though I don't think this is a major concern.\n\n**Option 2:** The second option, which is currently implemented, is that we have only one metadata field and we assume that any protocol-specific attributes are embedded in it. It would look like this:\n\n```\nJoinGroupRequest => GroupId SessionTimeout MemberId Protocols MemberMetadata\n  GroupId => String\n  SessionTimeout => int32\n  MemberId => String\n  Protocols => [String]\n  MemberMetadata => Bytes\n```\n\nThis is generally more difficult for clients to implement, but that depends largely on the format of the metadata. For example, if JSON is chosen, then protocol-specific attributes come naturally. However, it's a little tough to see how this would work for Kafka's packed structures, which have no field identifiers. As an advantage, since it allows protocols to share metadata, it avoids the duplication in the first approach. \n\nThe GroupProtocol field in the current patch was basically intended to declare compatibility of the metadata as used in Option 2. If we get rid of it, then I would tend to favor the first option. What do you think?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/147768297/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/147769885","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/296#issuecomment-147769885","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/296","id":147769885,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0Nzc2OTg4NQ==","user":{"login":"granthenke","id":1928566,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Mjg1NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1928566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke","html_url":"https://github.com/granthenke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-13T16:34:03Z","updated_at":"2015-10-13T16:34:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@ewencp Since [KAFKA-2205](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-2205) has a relative big breaking change...do we need to open a jira to fix that?
