Sorry for the late replies.\r\n\r\nWhat I meant is that we recommend contributors to have one PR for a specific issue (i.e. as described in the corresponding JIRA ticket), more incremental PRs for a single JIRA ticket if it is a rather big feature addition; in addition, if more minor issues were found while working on the JIRA, it is recommended to propose those changes in a separate PR (you can create another branch besides your current working branch, for example). This is mainly for the ease of reviewing and separate different logical changes to avoid mental context switches for reviewers:\r\n\r\nhttps://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Contributing+Code+Changes\r\n\r\nAs for your current PR, to me it seems few of them are directly related to the issue described in KAFKA-1610 (i.e. making a pass in the code for any variables resulted in `mapValues` and make sure there is no further modifications to them) besides some code cleanups; on the other hand there are a bunch of fixes  that seems irrelevant to this specific ticket, e.g. `adding toMap to make sure they are immutable after filling up the map`, which I think would better be in a separate JIRA; similarly for the TODO markers you proposed in the JIRA, I'd suggest making them as separate PRs as well.\r\n\r\nDoes this sounds reasonable to you? Apologies if such guidances were not communicated earlier in time.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/288254464/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/288254727","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2715#issuecomment-288254727","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2715","id":288254727,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4ODI1NDcyNw==","user":{"login":"ewencp","id":47366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp","html_url":"https://github.com/ewencp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-21T23:46:41Z","updated_at":"2017-03-21T23:46:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM and the failure is unrelated.

props for making the error message and doc output include the right description.

I'm all pro helping discovery, but this may need a mailing list discussion / vote. @ewencp?\r\n2. It will be nice to add few words about the new CLI to docs/connect.html. There's currently literally no description on what this does, how to use it, etc.\r\n3. Can you post a sample output of the log messages in the JIRA, so people can see \"before/after\"?\r\n\r\nOther than that, the change looks small and safe so +1, pending the possible short KIP for the new CLI and adding the docs. I'll also be happy to get this in if you remove the CLI and submit it in separate PR since it may require additional process.
