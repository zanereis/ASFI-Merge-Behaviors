introduction\r\n\r\nSOFAJRAFT is a production-grade java implementation of RAFT consensus algorithm. SOFAJRaft is licensed under the [Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/sofastack/sofa-jraft/blob/master/LICENSE). SOFAJRaft relies on some third-party components, and their open source protocol is also Apache License 2.0.\r\n\r\nThe core component is StateMachine and RheaKV .\r\n\r\nStateMachine is an implementation of users’ core logic. It calls the onApply(Iterator) method to apply log entries that are submitted with Node#apply(task) to the business state machine.\r\n\r\nRheaKV is a lightweight, distributed, and embedded KV storage library, which is included in the JRaft project as a submodule.\r\n\r\n## Ephemeral Node\r\nAll node information is stored in StateMachine's memory, StateMachine manages the registration and downtime of nodes, When a new node joins the cluster, a heartbeat packet is sent to the leader master,  The last update time of the node is recorded and synchronized to all masters。When there is a node down, Ephemeral Node Refresh Thread scan records in StateMachine , When the last update time differs from the current time by more than a certain amount of time, nodes are removed and the removed results are synchronized to other masters.\r\n<img width=\"509\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13765310/179958712-6509b5d9-abde-4d98-adc1-2f2ab642de04.png\">\r\n\r\n## Subscribe/Notify\r\nThe design of Subscribe/Notify is the same with ephemeral node, when leader master' StateMachine senses a data change in the server ,  then it will trigger the subscribed listener.\r\n<img width=\"661\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13765310/179921155-41ef98fe-1ce6-4e83-b174-893069e24cc4.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n## Global Lock\r\nThe design of global lock is the same with ephemeral node, there will be a KVStore in the StateMachine to store the lock info.  RheaKVStore will store the lock of master server and clear the expiry lock.\r\n<img width=\"554\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13765310/179961388-d02d1a33-2bf0-4321-b1c6-99465d31d8ae.png\">\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1190132664/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1190133260","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/pull/10296#issuecomment-1190133260","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/10296","id":1190133260,"node_id":"IC_kwDOClTkms5G7_4M","user":{"login":"MilkWangStudio","id":15866249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODY2MjQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15866249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MilkWangStudio","html_url":"https://github.com/MilkWangStudio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MilkWangStudio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MilkWangStudio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MilkWangStudio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MilkWangStudio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MilkWangStudio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MilkWangStudio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MilkWangStudio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MilkWangStudio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MilkWangStudio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-20T11:00:05Z","updated_at":"2022-07-20T11:00:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I saw this bug in 2.0.6 version.
