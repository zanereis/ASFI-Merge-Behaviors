However, I left the `Bindings` implementation unchanged despite the problems with concurrent access as it seems to be still the best solution. (I'm of course open for suggestions on how this can be improved.)\r\n\r\nI also noticed that my changes broke the `WithoutStrategies` source step as that now correctly expects to get the `Types` of the Strategies to exclude for which Gremlin.Net had no serializer. So I added a serializer that works basically like the respective one in gremlin-python as it also simply creates an object of the `Type` and then this object will be serialized as before. A unit test ensures that all Strategies have a parameterless constructor as we can't serialize their `Type` otherwise.\r\nHonestly, I was a bit surprised that I had to serialize `Types` by serializing an empty object of that `Type` although the IO docs show that the GraphSON type `g:Class` [can be serialized like this](http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/3.3.0/dev/io/#_class):\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"@type\" : \"g:Class\",\r\n  \"@value\" : \"java.io.File\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nbut the Gremlin Server couldn't deserialize the Strategy class when I serialized it like this. So is the documentation wrong here? @spmallette: Could you clarify my confusion here?\r\nAlso the IO docs don't mention how `TraversalStrategies` are serialized in general. Should we add that?\r\n\r\nThe build is currently failing, but that seems to be caused by travis-ci/travis-ci#8607. I built Gremlin.Net locally and executed the tests without any problems.\r\n\r\nBTW: Would it make sense to create a separate pull request for `master` or can we simply execute `generate.groovy` later when this is merged from `tp32` into `master`?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/337642623/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/337698409","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/730#issuecomment-337698409","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/730","id":337698409,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzY5ODQwOQ==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-18T19:14:33Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T19:14:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"VOTE

No computer specific setup time is measured\r\n2. Spark has a lot of lazy staff, so most of Spark RDD setup are counted as a first step.\r\n3. The algorithm could fail to assign timing to the right step in bas of sophisticated queries.\r\n\r\nBy the way new timing is pretty close to the wall clock time.

Generally speaking, I think a separate PR is only useful when there is potential for big conflicts and the PR is helpful for separate evaluation of the merge work. As long as you get both master and tp32 set and working locally before you push, you can generally get by without the second PR. The worst is when you push tp32 but then don't have master working right and there is a delay getting master up to date as it then has the potential to slow down other folks working on the repo.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/338992022/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/339041012","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/734#issuecomment-339041012","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/734","id":339041012,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzOTA0MTAxMg==","user":{"login":"artem-aliev","id":1150911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTA5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1150911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-aliev","html_url":"https://github.com/artem-aliev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-aliev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-aliev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-aliev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-aliev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-aliev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-aliev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-aliev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-aliev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-aliev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-24T16:00:04Z","updated_at":"2017-10-24T16:00:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Something strange happened, during rebases.

I see that you used the -q option. What happens if there is a failure in native python tests? currently i don't see any output for those, i'm wondering how that will fail when it does.\r\n\r\nI was looking for ways to limit the output, TravisCI only accepts up to 4Mb which is a lot... On previous commits I've tried to set either: \r\n\r\n`-Dorg.slf4j.simpleLogger.log.org.apache.maven.cli.transfer.Slf4jMavenTransferListener=warn`\r\nor \r\n`-Dorg.slf4j.simpleLogger.defaultLogLevel=WARN`\r\n\r\nBut it was not being considered by `mvn`. Maybe including any of [those options on the root pom](https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/2e4f8bf7c3a1c9e39729ab5aab4886f1f469d641/pom.xml#L1335-L1336) would work, that way I could remove the quiet flag, wdyt?\r\n\r\n> I think it's good to include the GLVs on Travis, but it won't eliminate local builds completely because travis doesn't run integration tests - nor do we want it to probably.\r\n\r\nhmm... Looking at the output, I see that both unit and integration tests are run for Gremlin.Net which is unexpected (would be the only module doing both).\r\n\r\nNow that I think of it, maybe it would be best to run different jobs on the same build, using [a build matrix](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/customizing-the-build/#Build-Matrix) or even [build steps](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/build-stages/define-steps/). That way we could run individual profiles (glvs, integration tests for different modules, ...) in different jobs for the same build.\r\n\r\nWe should find a way to continuously run most of the test suite, to ease the burden of having to run it locally.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/340464260/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/340602037","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/734#issuecomment-340602037","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/734","id":340602037,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MDYwMjAzNw==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-30T22:19:23Z","updated_at":"2017-10-30T22:19:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@okram
