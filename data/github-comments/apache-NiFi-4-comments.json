Certainly a nice addition to the GetKafka processor. The patch looks good, but I did have just a couple of small points of feedback.\n\nFor the PropertyDescriptor added, it may helpful to explain in a little more detail in the \"description\" what exactly the property controls & when it takes effect, for those who may be less familiar with Kafka.\n\nI was also a bit confused by the addition of the @WritesAttribute annotation - it indicates that the outgoing FlowFile will have an attribute named \"auto.offset.reset\" but that attribute is not added to the FlowFile. This may be a misunderstanding of what the @WritesAttribute annotation is used for perhaps?\n\nOtherwise, the patch looks great.

What framework attributes should be protected, is it everything in CoreAttributes?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/157484556/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/157495716","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/116#issuecomment-157495716","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/116","id":157495716,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NzQ5NTcxNg==","user":{"login":"apiri","id":502889,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjg4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/502889?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri","html_url":"https://github.com/apiri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-17T20:21:57Z","updated_at":"2015-11-17T20:21:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@jskora Sorry, I think a few of the different contexts from messages between you, @trkurc and I made communication a bit jumbled.\n\nTo that end, I am onboard with regex, but personally, would not want a second field to the same focus.  The issue that is present is more of an issue with the underlying framework and its handling with EL.  What I was suggesting with the regex validator is applying the validation to an entered string, but bypassing validation for where these values are specified on a per FlowFile basis via EL.  What is missing is not so much the granularity as it is the ability to route failures which is currently nonexistent and was some of what @trkurc was asking about what the appropriate tradeoffs/concessions are given the current state of the framework.  To this idea, I am more for keeping consistent with how we are now and letting this get addressed with the needed framework adjustments as we move forward.\n\nTo your question regarding deletion, that is certainly not on you or any extension developer.  As highlighted by NIFI-1181/1182, these values are safeguarded but your processor exposed the bug of where it was not safeguarded in this context.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/157495716/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/157499228","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/116#issuecomment-157499228","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/116","id":157499228,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NzQ5OTIyOA==","user":{"login":"trkurc","id":3050642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTA2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3050642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trkurc","html_url":"https://github.com/trkurc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trkurc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trkurc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trkurc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trkurc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trkurc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trkurc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trkurc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trkurc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trkurc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-17T20:37:33Z","updated_at":"2015-11-17T20:37:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I am 100% in agreement with @apiri \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/157499228/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/157510163","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/116#issuecomment-157510163","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/116","id":157510163,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NzUxMDE2Mw==","user":{"login":"jskora","id":181587,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTU4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/181587?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jskora","html_url":"https://github.com/jskora","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jskora/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jskora/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jskora/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jskora/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jskora/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jskora/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jskora/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jskora/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jskora/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-17T21:18:48Z","updated_at":"2015-11-17T21:18:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@apiri, that makes sense regarding the framework.

I think we'll want to avoid having shaded jars and such being utilized for this.  It complicates the licensing and related concerns and we have done an extremely good job getting those clean even to the point of every binary artifact we produce (nars) having embedded license/notice data correct to all sub-dependencies.\n\nThis is an area which really highlights our need to tackle the extension registry.  We need to, on the other side of this release, figure out how we as a community can get more agility for releasing extensions like this versus the core framework.\n\nOlegZ: We do need to tackle any copyright assertions on contributed source and ensure all proper license and notice adherence occurs.  I'm overly generalizing here but there are like maybe five people on earth (I'm looking at you Sean Busbey) that care about following the strict guidance of licensing and notices at the level we do.  In basically every contrib that brings in dependencies we'll have to help others most likely.  Feels like a fine trade in exchange for contributions of helpful things the community will benefit from.\n\nWe also need to ensure that there is appropriate testing.  However, above all else we need to keep in mind this community is powered by contributions.  So in every exchange let's make sure our discussions stay focused on helping folks bring contribs along.  As specific example consider the lack of unit tests.  We could as part of the review build them.  Or as part of the feedback ask if there are ideas on how to include some.  Some extensions and contributions are inherently really hard to unit test.  I don't know if this one is or isn't.  Adding unit tests or asking if unit tests can be included is more powerful than saying we can't accept the contrib without them.  The difference can at times be subtle but the effect on the community and tenor of discussion can be dramatic.  \n\nSo far everyone in the community has done an awesome job of helping each other find the middle ground on contributions so that we can be inclusive and encouraging while increasing quality as well.\n\nThanks\nJoe\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/158074311/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/158083303","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/116#issuecomment-158083303","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/116","id":158083303,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1ODA4MzMwMw==","user":{"login":"jskora","id":181587,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTU4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/181587?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jskora","html_url":"https://github.com/jskora","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jskora/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jskora/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jskora/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jskora/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jskora/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jskora/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jskora/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jskora/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jskora/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-19T15:05:38Z","updated_at":"2015-11-19T15:05:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closed by apache/nifi commits 52b24b93d9f7763744c792c0cfed8974f8e6cb83 and 9e2f6df20511b814b761726e40f2d3b1f498cc9f.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/158083303/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/158084660","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/128#issuecomment-158084660","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/128","id":158084660,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1ODA4NDY2MA==","user":{"login":"joey","id":249392,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTM5Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/249392?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joey","html_url":"https://github.com/joey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-19T15:10:34Z","updated_at":"2015-11-19T15:10:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rdblue I'm guessing that you used the shade plugin due to the hive-exec jar embedding so many libraries in unshaded package names?\n\nIf so, I've got a pom that pulls in direct dependencies that can talk to the Hive metastore without the hive-exec jar.

Basically one of the biggest changes that went in with this commit is setting _name_ and _displayName_. So when one attempts to set the property (e.g., 'client.id') as dynamic property, the NiFi will pop up with the message 'A property with this name already exists.’.

AES is restricted to 128 bit (16 bytes) by default without these policy files. \n\nHowever, in examining the code, we believe we have found a larger issue in Java's handling of the key when using password-based encryption. In a normal scenario, the key is generated or derived and then used to initialize the cipher as follows:\n\n``` java\n    try {\n                MessageDigest sha1 = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA1\");\n                String key = Hex.encodeHexString(sha1.digest(\"thisIsABadPassword\".getBytes())).substring(0, 32);\n                String iv = Hex.encodeHexString(sha1.digest(\"thisIsABadIv\".getBytes())).substring(0, 32);\n\n                SecretKey secretKey = new SecretKeySpec(Hex.decodeHex(key.toCharArray()), \"AES\");\n                IvParameterSpec ivParameterSpec = new IvParameterSpec(Hex.decodeHex(iv.toCharArray()));\n\n                cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS7Padding\");\n                cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secretKey, ivParameterSpec);\n\n                String message = \"This is a plaintext message.\";\n\n                byte[] cipherBytes = cipher.doFinal(message.getBytes());\n\n                cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, secretKey, ivParameterSpec);\n\n                byte[] recoveredBytes = cipher.doFinal(cipherBytes);\n\n                System.out.println(\"Recovered message: \" + new String(recoveredBytes));\n\n            } catch (Exception e) {\n                fail(e.getMessage());\n            }\n```\n\nDuring `cipher.init()`, the system checks `Cipher.getMaxAllowedKeyLength(\"AES\")` for the key limit in bits. As 32 hex == 16 bytes == 128 bits, this will run on a vanilla JRE installation. However, using the password-based encryption `PBEParameterSpec` is slightly different. \n\n``` java\n    try {\n        String password = \"thisIsABadPassword\";\n        String salt = \"SALTSALT\";\n\n        PBEKeySpec keySpec = new PBEKeySpec(password);\nSecretKeyFactory keyFactory = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(\"PBEWITHMD5AND256BITAES-CBC-OPENSSL\", \"BC\");\n        SecretKey key = keyFactory.generateSecret(keySpec);\n\n        PBEParameterSpec saltSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt.getBytes(\"US-ASCII\"), 0);\n\n        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"PBEWITHMD5AND256BITAES-CBC-OPENSSL\", \"BC\");\n        cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key, saltSpec);\n\n        String message = \"This is a plaintext message.\";\n\n        byte[] cipherBytes = cipher.doFinal(message.getBytes());\n\n        cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, key, saltSpec);\n\n        byte[] recoveredBytes = cipher.doFinal(cipherBytes);\n\n        System.out.println(\"Recovered message: \" + new String(recoveredBytes));\n\n    } catch (Exception e) {\n        fail(e.getMessage());\n    }\n```\n\nThe actual key is not derived until **during** `cipher.init()`, so at the time the key length check is done, it is actually checking the length of the raw password. This means that a vanilla JRE installation can use 256-bit AES to encrypt or decrypt a file provided the password is <= 16 bytes. The tests above fail because the provided password is 18 bytes. However, the algorithm used is still AES-256-CBC, which means the derived key is 32 bytes. This has been verified on a vanilla JRE installation decrypting OpenSSL AES-256-CBC encrypted files. \n\nI will look at @apiri 's patch on NIFI-1242 but this is a serious issue and should be well-documented. The usual test of \"is available on a vanilla JRE because the key length is <= 128 bits (for AES)\" is no longer sufficient because the supplied password length now affects the determination.

I started digging in, and I think the discussion on where this goes (which I added to the ticket) probably should have gone on a little longer (no fault of yours, I'm glad you took the initiative and put the code together). I could be wrong, but I think @bbende was more discussing in abstract terms. I have to admit, the abstract processor feels a little bit out of place in nifi-processor-utils, but I don't have a good answer for where general purpose abstract processors should be! I think @joewitt may have been suggesting a new module like nifi-commons/nifi-abstract-processors/`<abstract processor>`? \n\nSecondly, I think rather than a move, deprecating the one in :nifi-standard-processors and making a copy of the classes to the new location would be appropriate for 0.5.0.
