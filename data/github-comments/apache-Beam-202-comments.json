As more and more exclusive features are brought up, I'm thinking it's time to create dedicated KafkaIO for each version. @rangadi any thoughts?\r\n\r\nIt is more of new features in recent versions of Kafka. I don't think we need to separate versions of KafkaIO (and all the maintenance and customer confusion it brings) yet. The current approach is fine as long as we make it clear to the users with good log messages. E.g. if a user sets start time with 0.9 client in classpath, the failure message should clearly say it only supported in newer versions of Kafka client, and point them to a link that describe how to use different versions of Kafka consumers with Beam.

I think this is a good start. Bounded source support can be added later.\r\nPlease address the comments above and couple more things : \r\n  - Good JavaDoc for 'withStartReadTime()' explaining when it takes effect and overrides consumer config (`auto.offset.reset` is not used and any committed offsets are not used either). \r\n  - Initialization should fail descriptive message if Kafka version is too old.\r\n  \r\n> If no message has a timestamp that is greater than or equals to the target time, a null will be returned. In this case, we need read the latest.\r\n\r\nMakes sense. It would better to log this since it is quite unusual. May be it could even be an error.\r\n\r\n> If the message format version in a partition is before 0.10.0, i.e. the messages do not have timestamps, null will be returned for that partition. In this case, we need read the latest too, because these messages are invalid.\r\n\r\nShouldn't this be a failure? I don't think reading from latest is correct. If we can't distinguish between 'no messages later than T' and 'this partition does not support timestamp based offset', I think it would be better to fail.
