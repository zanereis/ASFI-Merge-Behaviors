In the case of not being able to install packages on the OS, ie. in our environment there is a separation of concerns so we are not allowed to install packages or update them, you can now package your DAGs together with dependencies.\n2. Versioning: Although this is a bit in the future, we could allow airflow only to pickup dependencies from site-wide or from a \"dag-zip\" to allow multiple versions.\n3. Combining multiple dags into 1 zip for better manageability.\n\nWhere our perspectives might differ is that we are not using \"git sync\" and we have the need to make the addition of dags authenticated and easier to manage. This is first step towards that.\n\nAdding it to sys.path is standard python and is fully supported, but to address your concerns I could make it configurable by adding a \"support_zip_dag\" and \"support_zip_dependencies\" and a a log.info when a dependency is picked up and added to the sys.path.

E.g using CeleryExecutor, it looks like scheduler ends num_runs without holding on to any task execution whereas for LocalExecutor it does. In terms of shutting down tasks, we've designed our operator to be idempotent using XCom so that a random task kill is fine for us. As a workaround, we gave the sensor task a short timeout with many retries so that it doesn't always block scheduler. But it'll be great to know what you think on this issue.

Before I implement it, just want to confirm that by DAG UI, do you mean adding an additional field in the table in **Browser -> DagRun**?  Or do you have another place for it in mind?\n\nAs for Cluster Monitoring, a separate page will probably be created, i.e. **Admin -> Cluster Monitoring**.\nI discussed with @criccomini  about this and would like to get your input on it:\n\nCurrently, the pid that the scheduler job is running on is not tracked anywhere in the db, which implies that if the process gets killed for whatever reason while running, the job state in the db will stuck as 'running' forever and can be misleading in the UI. Would it make sense to do a kill_zomebies() for the Jobs similar to how the TIs works (i.e. if it's been a long time since the last heartbeat)?  Or are there any caveats to this?\n\nAnother question related to this but is on a higher level is that in general, there are some information we are not currently tracking in the db: if we have 2+ schedulers on the same instance, we cannot differentiate them from one another other than the Job Id, since the ids are assigned arbitrarily. Would it make sense to introduce pid or port or some kind of unique identifier so we know exactly which scheduler is down?
