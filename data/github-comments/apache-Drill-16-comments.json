Please find new solution and description of changes below:\r\n \r\nLazy-init was performed only when function was not found during Calcite parsing but DRILL-4963 shows different cases when Calcite parsing can pass (usually during function overloading) but still function is not found. To handle such cases, we need to enhance lazy-init process:\r\n1. Lazy-init process should be more light-weight. Currently when function is not found, we load all jars from remote function registry and compare with jars from local function registry. It's not optimal especially when both registries are in sync. To improve performance I have introduced remove function registry version which can be used to check if we need to sync remote and local registries prior to checking jars and functions.\r\n2. During parsing stage we were only catching Calcite parsing exception but function not found can be also indicated by Drill function error and so on. Not to be engaged into enumerating possible exceptions (which can added in the code later), we are checking if remote and local function registries are in sync on any error. Such check may only affect on queries that will fail anyway. So if failure time will take a little bit longer, it won't make significant difference.\r\n3. During execution stage Drill attempts to find matching function from the list of functions with the same names. `DefaultFunctionResolver.getBestMatch()` does not do exact match, it may return function with different input parameters types. Best match is found according to rules described in `TypeCastRules.class`. Currently we attempt to sync remote and local function registries only if best matching function was found but it is not correct since even if Drill finds the best matching function among current functions but does not mean that remote function registry does not hold even better matching function. To fix this issue we would first try to find function using `ExactFunctionResolver.getBestMatch()` and if exactly matching function is not found, we'll check if remote and local function registries are in sync and then use `DefaultFunctionResolver.getBestMatch()` to find the best matching function. But if exactly matching function is found, we'll return it right away without any registries sync checks.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n1. Add `consists` method to PersistentStore interface which can return true if key exists in store, false otherwise. This method is needed to return only remote function registry version without its content (unlike method `get`). We'll pull remote function registry content only if versions are different.\r\n2.

you for the very clear explanation. It is now obvious that the original lazy init design relied on the \"found/not found\" semantics of a simple name match: no ambiguity there. However, there is ambiguity with the overload rules.

This must be done for every query (with functions) since we can never be certain whether an override exists in the registry.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that a check of ZK, even to get a version, adds latency. 99.9% of the time, nothing will have changed. How can we fix that?\r\n\r\nLet's take a step back. The original problems we tried to solve were:\r\n\r\nIf a user executes a CREATE FUNCTION x on Drillbit A and the command returns successfully, then:\r\n\r\n* If the same user immediately executes a query using x on the same Drillbit, that query succeeds.\r\n* If some other user executes a query using x (on any Drillbit, say Drillbit B), then the query either fails (x is not found) or succeeds (x is found on Drillbit B and on all Drillbits that run fragments.)\r\n\r\nIn general, the above requires lots of synchronization: we'd want every Drillbit to synchronize with the registry before every query parse and fragment execution. We know that is expensive. So, we looked for special case opportunities to exploit. The \"found/not found\" semantics above appeared to provide that special case. What that trick off the table, we are back to the massive synchronization solution, which is costly.\r\n\r\nWe want to keep the semantics listed above, but without the cost of synchronization.\r\nJust tossing out ideas (I'm not (yet) proposing changes), perhaps:\r\n\r\n* Each Drillbit maintains a cache of the most recent ZK registry version it has seen.\r\n* When a Foreman registers a function, it updates the ZK registry and its locally-cached version number.\r\n* When a Foreman runs a query, it includes the registry version number in the physical plan sent to each Drillbit for execution.\r\n* The Drillbit checks the plan's version number against its cached version. If the plan version is newer, the Drillbit downloads the latest registry data and updates its cached version number.\r\n\r\nThe above ensures that, if a function is registered on Drillbit A, then any query that is submitted to A will execute anywhere on the cluster. So far so good.\r\n\r\nBut, what about queries submitted to Drillbits B, C and D? How do they learn about the new functions? Here, perhaps we can use an eventually consistent pattern. The other Drillbits listen for ZK change notifications and refresh their local registries from ZK, and update the locally cached version number.\r\n\r\nNow, we get the semantics that if a function is defined on Drillbit A, a brief time later it will be available on Drillbits B, C and D. Once available, the above rules apply: the registry version is written into the plan and all other fragment executors will force update their local registries if they haven't yet gotten the ZK update notices.\r\n\r\nThe only drawback is a slight delay in a function becoming available to the cluster. But, that delay is fine in an eventually consistent design. Said another way, we make no transaction guarantees that updating something on Drillbit A will be immediately reflected on B, etc.\r\n\r\nThis is a rough draft. It may be what the code does.

If I define a function `foo(long)`, but call it with an `int`, we won't get an exact match, will we? So, on every call we'd have to check if there is a new, better, match for `foo()` in the registry. This means a call to ZK for every function in every query where we don't have an exact parameter match. My suspicion is that this will be a performance issue, but we won't know until someone tests it.\r\n\r\nI wonder if we should do this fix incrementally. This PR is better than the original, as it does handle overloads. After that, we can do a bit of performance testing to see the impact of checking ZK for the version on every overloaded method.

comment got lost in the force-push. One was related to the output batch size, suggesting we cap it at 16 MB. The reason is that value vectors about 16 MB cause memory fragmentation. A later fix will limit an output batch to either 64K rows (the size of an sv2) or so that the longest vector is smaller than 16 MB. The most recent commit added per-column size information so that we can enforce this limit. For example, we can have 64K rows with columns of size 256 bytes within a 16 MB vector. There is no reason not to allow 64K rows even for rows with four of the 256 columns. Total batch size would be 64 MB, but no single vector would be above 16 MB.\r\n\r\nThat fix will be offered, along with tests and enabling the managed sort by default, in a subsequent PR.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/278256765/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/278468879","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/578#issuecomment-278468879","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/578","id":278468879,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3ODQ2ODg3OQ==","user":{"login":"sudheeshkatkam","id":3272600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNzI2MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3272600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam","html_url":"https://github.com/sudheeshkatkam","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-08T21:34:49Z","updated_at":"2017-02-08T21:34:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+

bug here is fundamental to the way Drill works with JSON. We already had an extensive discussion around this area in another PR. The problem is that JSON supports a null type which is independent of all other types. In JSON, a null is not a \"null int\" or a \"null string\" -- it is just null.\r\n\r\nDrill must infer a type for a field. This leads to all kinds of grief when a file contains a run of nulls before the real value:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n{ id: 1, b: null }\r\n...\r\n{ id: 80000, b: \"gee, I'm a string!\" }\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nDrill must do something with the leading values. \"b\" is a null... what? Int? String?\r\n\r\nWe've had many bugs in this area. The bugs are not just code bugs, they represent a basic incompatibility between Drill and JSON.\r\n\r\nThis fix is yet another attempt to work around the limitation, but cannot overcome the basic incompatibility.\r\n\r\nWhat we are doing, it seems, is building a list of fields that have seen only null values, deferring action on those fields until later. That works fine if \"later\" occurs in the same record batch. It is not clear what happens if we get to the end of the batch (as in the example above), but have never seen the type of the field: what type of vector do we create?\r\n\r\nThere are several solutions.\r\n\r\nOne is to have a \"null\" type in Drill. When we see the initial run of nulls, we simply create a field of the \"null\" type. We have type conversion rules that say that a \"null\" vector can be coerced into any other type when we ultimately see the type. (And, if we don't see a type in one batch, we can pass the null vector along upstream for later reconciliation.) This is a big change; too big for a bug fix.\r\n\r\nAnother solution, used here, is to keep track of \"null only\" fields, to defer the decision for later. That has a performance impact.\r\n\r\nA third solution is to go ahead and create a vector of any type, keep setting its values to null (as if we had already seen the field type), but be ready to discard that vector and convert it to the proper type once we see that type. In this way, we treat null fields just as any other up to the point where we realize we have a type conflict. Only then do we check the \"null only\" map and decide we can quietly convert the vector type to the proper type.\r\n\r\nThese are the initial thoughts. I'll add more nuanced comments as I review the code in more detail.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/280814971/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/280886766","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/594#issuecomment-280886766","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/594","id":280886766,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MDg4Njc2Ng==","user":{"login":"paul-rogers","id":3248881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDg4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3248881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers","html_url":"https://github.com/paul-rogers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-19T00:54:39Z","updated_at":"2017-02-19T00:54:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"We have three cases for nulls:\r\n\r\n1. See a typed field, followed by nulls. Here, we know the type, just mark the current field as null.\r\n2. Run of nulls at start of file, followed by a non-null value within the same record batch. We can transform the null field into a typed field. That is what this fix tries to do.\r\n3. Run of nulls in one record batch, followed by a non-null value in the next batch. This must trigger a schema change.

(Once a type as been seen for a column, Drill will remember that type.)\r\n* Drill cannot predict the future. (If a type has not been seen for a column by the end of a record batch, Drill cannot predict what type will appear in some later batch.)\r\n* Drill can amend the past within a single record batch. (If a batch starts with nulls, but later a type is seen, the previous values are automatically filled with nulls.)\r\n\r\nActual implementation of the JSON reader, and the value writers that form the implementation, is complex. As we read JSON values, we ask a type-specific writer to set that value into the value vector. Each writer marks the column as non-null, then adds the value. Any values not so set will default to null.\r\n\r\nConsider a file with five null \"c1\" values followed by a string value \"foo\" for that field. The five nulls are ignored. When we see the non-null c1, the code creates a VarChar vector and sets the 6th value to the string \"foo\". Doing so automatically marks the previous five column values as null.\r\n\r\nSuppose we have a file with a single string value \"foo\" for column \"c1\", followed by five nulls. In this case, the first value creates and sets the VarChar vector as before. Later, at the end of reading the record batch, the reader sets the record count for the vectors. This action, on the VarChar vector, has the effect of setting the trailing five column values to null.\r\n\r\nSince values default to null, we get this behavior, and the previous, for free. The result is that if a record batch contains even a single non-null value for a field, that column will be fully populated with nulls for all other records in the same batch.\r\n\r\nThis gets us back to the same old problem in Drill: if all we see are nulls, Drill needs to know, \"null of what type\" while in JSON the value is just null. The JIRA tickets linked to this ticket all related to that same underlying issue.\r\n\r\nThere is a long history of this issue: DRILL-5033, DRILL-1256, DRILL-4479, DRILL-3806 and more.\r\n\r\nThis fix affects only \"all text mode.\" This means that, regardless of the JSON type, create a VarChar column. Doing so provides a very simple fix. Since all columns are VarChar, when we see a new column, with a null value, just create a VarChar column. (No need to set the column to null.)\r\n\r\nThat is, we can \"predict the future\" for nulls because *all* columns are VarChar -- so there is not much to predict.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, we have to stick with Jacques' design decision in DRILL-1256: \"Drill's perspective is a non-existent column and a column with no value are equivalent.\" A record batch of all nulls, followed by a record batch with a non-null value, will cause a schema change.\r\n\r\nAgain, Drill needs a \"null\" type that is compatible with all other types in order to support JSON semantics. (And, needs to differentiate between value-exists-and-is-null and value-does-not-exist.)\r\n\r\nYet another solution is to have the user tell us their intent. The [JSON Schema](http://jsonschema.net) project provides a way to express the expected schema so that Drill would know up front the type of each column (and whether the column is really nullable.)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/281208898/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/281210245","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/594#issuecomment-281210245","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/594","id":281210245,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MTIxMDI0NQ==","user":{"login":"paul-rogers","id":3248881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDg4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3248881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers","html_url":"https://github.com/paul-rogers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-21T00:09:58Z","updated_at":"2017-02-21T00:09:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Given all the above, there is very simple fix to the particular case that this bug covers.\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n  private void writeDataAllText(MapWriter map, FieldSelection selection,\r\n    ...\r\n      case VALUE_NULL:\r\n        // Here we do have a type.
