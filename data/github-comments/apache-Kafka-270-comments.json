I think the issue is that MockClient uses `Metadata#update()` which takes the cluster provided for metadata response or the existing cluster from `Metadata#fetch()` and takes the subset of topics from the cluster that are active. The test (at least this failing one) creates metadata responses assuming a single thread. If the heartbeat thread happens to do the update before the subscribe to `otherTopic`, then `otherTopic` is removed from the metadata. Even if we install a cluster in `MockClient`, we will still need to avoid `Metadata.update()` to leave the topic in the metadata when the poll is from the heartbeat thread. The fix in this PR does a `Metadata#update()` from the main thread before `poll()` to ensure that there is always an update with `otherTopic` before the poll that expects it. Not sure if any of that makes sense :-)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/306468940/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/306472348","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/3237#issuecomment-306472348","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/3237","id":306472348,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNjQ3MjM0OA==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-06T12:34:27Z","updated_at":"2017-06-06T12:34:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nRefer to this link for build results (access rights to CI server needed): \nhttps://builds.apache.org/job/kafka-pr-jdk8-scala2.12/4941/\nTest FAILed (JDK 8 and Scala 2.12).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/306472348/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/306478962","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/3231#issuecomment-306478962","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/3231","id":306478962,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNjQ3ODk2Mg==","user":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-06T13:01:58Z","updated_at":"2017-06-06T13:01:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I left the JIRA open as per @hachikuji's earlier comment in the PR.

: Thanks for the patch. Haven't looked at it in details. Just a couple of quick comments. (1) Once a disk is marked offline, it might be useful for the admin to be able to fix the bad disk (e.g., remounting) while the broker is online. This reduces the time that a broker has to be down while waiting for a disk to be fixed. If we do support this, it would be useful to test this out a bit. (2) According to http://www.mapdb.org/blog/mmap_files_alloc_and_jvm_crash/, it seems that an I/O exception in mmap buffer crashes the JVM. This will affect the failure detection in JBOD. Not sure how much we can do to improve it in the short term. At the minimum, it would be useful to do some testing to see how much this impacts us and document the
