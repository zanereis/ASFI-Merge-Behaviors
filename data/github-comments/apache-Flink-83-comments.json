So basically the same motivation as Timo. However, I see @ChengXiangLi's point. I am OK with doing the code gen during the Calcite translation process. \n\nI also like @twalthr's idea to have a recursive `DataSet translateToPlan()` method which builds the DataSet program. Then we do not need the final step at all and can keep all information inside of the Flink RelNodes (except for the generated DataSet).\n\nRegarding this PR, I have a few remarks:\n- Filter should be translated to FlatMap functions. Flink wraps FilterFunctions in FlatMapFunctions, so we can save a little bit here.\n- Rename the current ReduceNode to GroupReduceNode and add a ReduceNode. With the support for hash-based Reduce combiner (#1517), Reduce will gain a lot of performance. However, not all aggregation functions can be expressed by reduce so we should keep GroupReduceNode. \n- Add groupingKeys to ReduceNode (and GroupReduceNode)\n- It would be good to add information for the name of operators (maybe derived from the RexNode) and the parallelism.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/174518788/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/174519860","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1543#issuecomment-174519860","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1543","id":174519860,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3NDUxOTg2MA==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-25T14:14:51Z","updated_at":"2016-01-25T14:14:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The idea sounds very good.

Do we really want to have parts of the Table API written in Java and some other parts written in Scala? Until this PR everything was written Scala. IMHO this was nicer code.\nIs it ok to refactor the packages again? I think \"sql\" and \"calcite\" should not be contained in the package names. Instead dividing in into \"logical\" and \"physical\" would make more sense.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/176133567/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/176144759","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1544#issuecomment-176144759","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1544","id":176144759,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3NjE0NDc1OQ==","user":{"login":"ChengXiangLi","id":4425616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MjU2MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4425616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChengXiangLi","html_url":"https://github.com/ChengXiangLi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChengXiangLi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChengXiangLi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChengXiangLi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChengXiangLi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChengXiangLi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChengXiangLi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChengXiangLi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChengXiangLi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChengXiangLi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-28T11:59:23Z","updated_at":"2016-01-28T11:59:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I didn't prefer Java or Scala, the reason why i writen this in Java is that, this part logic would be translated from Calcite RelNodes(which is in Java) and finally could build Flink program based on Flink Java DataSet API.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/176144759/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/176150700","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1544#issuecomment-176150700","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1544","id":176150700,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3NjE1MDcwMA==","user":{"login":"twalthr","id":5746567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDY1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5746567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr","html_url":"https://github.com/twalthr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-28T12:14:46Z","updated_at":"2016-01-28T12:14:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"When I wrote my SQL prototype I also thought about using Java because Calcite is written in Java, but since it is easy to use Java classes from Scala and Scala has a much better feature set and is more concise, I would strongly insist to use Scala.
