Maybe we can try to call it out in the initial PR or something like that?  Ideally this info would show up in the release notes as well.

I am for deprecating commands.properties, and honestly I wish it would have been removed from the source tree altogether long ago instead of informally deprecated, because people have been adding to it rather than using annotations. I've spoken to committers even recently who didn't realize that you didn't have to use commands.properties. The annotation and dymanic methods are so much cleaner, particularly for plugin developers as it's often the only piece of the source tree that they have to change outside of their own plugin directory.\n\nI don't really think the majority of users will care about the implementation, so long as functionally the result is the same. That is to say that the API permissions on a fresh install before and after this is merged should behave the same out of the box. If that's the case then I don't think users will feel forced into anything or even notice that something was changed, and if someone really does care, it sounds simple enough to enable commands.properties. If someone is used to fiddling with this file, they won't have difficulty creating it and toggling a global setting manually. Speaking from having the experience of trying to manage a custom commands.properties, the work involved here to choose static is minor compared to simply maintaining a custom commands.properties, making sure an upgrade doesn't overwrite your change, and merging in new changes.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/214843061/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/214852970","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1517#issuecomment-214852970","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1517","id":214852970,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNDg1Mjk3MA==","user":{"login":"wido","id":326786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/326786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido","html_url":"https://github.com/wido","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-26T19:09:38Z","updated_at":"2016-04-26T19:09:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ah, yes, I see @rhtyd !\n\nLGTM\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/214852970/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/214853978","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1518#issuecomment-214853978","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1518","id":214853978,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNDg1Mzk3OA==","user":{"login":"wido","id":326786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/326786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido","html_url":"https://github.com/wido","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-26T19:11:20Z","updated_at":"2016-04-26T19:11:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks!

Each feature/marvin-test may require test specific environment so I'm not sure if we can have a general solution.\n\nIn general, for writing marvin tests new dependencies maybe added to marvin itself (like for this PR, `ipmisim` dependency is added to marvin, so anytime you install it you automatically get the dependency necessary by your Python based test). Along with this, you may need any external dependencies added to packaging requirements/dependency (for example, `ipmitool` added to debian control, while for rpms `ipmitool` was already in the list of dependencies for cloudstack-management package). For running tests, we should expect the test to work out of the box provided the dependencies are installed. For this PR, I've got `ipmisim` added to marvin's setup.py, and for Travis specific there is a apt-get install ipmitool. After this the oobm marvin test runs like any other test and internally is responsible for setting up (fake) ipmi server etc.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/214858085/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/214858450","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1348#issuecomment-214858450","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1348","id":214858450,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNDg1ODQ1MA==","user":{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-26T19:25:00Z","updated_at":"2016-04-26T19:25:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"LGTM, though it would be great if @DaanHoogland can move part of the test string from the Test to an xml file under resources\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/214858450/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/214861439","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1466#issuecomment-214861439","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1466","id":214861439,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNDg2MTQzOQ==","user":{"login":"rafaelweingartner","id":4129005,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjkwMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4129005?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelweingartner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-26T19:36:02Z","updated_at":"2016-04-26T19:36:02Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"On Jenkins I saw an error that is due to environment misconfigurations:\n\n> [FATAL] Non-parseable settings /home/jenkins/.m2/settings.xml: unexpected character in markup % (position: START_TAG seen ...</username>\\n     <password><%... @14:18)  @ /home/jenkins/.m2/settings.xml, line 14, column 18\n\nAnd then on Travis there is an error that is caused by a wrong table definition:\n\n> [ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.codehaus.mojo:exec-maven-plugin:1.2.1:java (create-schema) on project cloud-developer: An exception occured while executing the Java class. null: InvocationTargetException: Unable to upgrade the database: Unable to execute upgrade script: /home/travis/build/apache/cloudstack/developer/target/db/db/schema-481to490.sql: Incorrect table definition;

I have created a hierarchy to help you.  The classes with an \\* are the ones that you did not touch directly, they are there just to build the hierarchy. I found a little odd that the “ListTemplateCommand” received those values too, are they being used there?\n\nMaybe you cannot write a single super class to attend all of those cases, but you could easily write on to be the super class for (CopyVolumeCommand, SecStorageSetupCommand, GetStorageStatsCommand, SnapshotCommand, BackupSnapshotCommand , CreatePrivateTemplateFromSnapshotCommand,  CreatePrivateTemplateFromVolumeCommand, CreateVolumeFromSnapshotCommand)\n\nHere is the hierachy:\n\n```\n- TemplateOrVolumePostUploadCommand\n- Command*\n    -- StorageCommand*\n        --- ListTemplateCommand\n    -- SsCommand*\n                --- AbstractDownloadCommand*\n                        ---- PrimaryStorageDownloadCommand\n    -- CopyVolumeCommand\n    -- SecStorageSetupCommand\n    -- GetStorageStatsCommand\n        -- SnapshotCommand\n                --- BackupSnapshotCommand \n                --- CreatePrivateTemplateFromSnapshotCommand\n                --- CreatePrivateTemplateFromVolumeCommand\n                --- CreateVolumeFromSnapshotCommand\n```\n\nI missing the test cases for “checkStorageProcessorAndHandlerNfsVersionAttribute”, “examineStorageSubSystemCommandNfsVersion”, “setCurrentNfsVersionInProcessorAndHandler” , “getStorageNfsVersionFromNfsTO”  and “reconfigureNfsVersion” methods. They are very good coded, clean, short, well documented.

+1 -- well said.  command.properties presents a number of significant problems.  First, in a clustered environment, it is possible (and quite easy) for there to be inconsistent security policies across the cluster.  Second, command.properties does not permit the definition of new roles.  Limiting users to 4 roles in a modern cloud environment is a barrier to CloudStack adoption.\n\nAs Marcus has stated, we can't move forward if we keep trying to maintain outdated mechanisms.  Existing users can continue to use command.properties and migrate if/when they desire.

> That is to say that the API permissions on a fresh install before and after this is merged should behave the same out of the box.

I know testing have been done but is it good enough to say that things are consistent before and after. Note that there is data migration happening from commands.properties to DB. I know that commands.properties has it limitations but that doesn't mean it needs to be removed immediately. Let the new feature be there for atleast a couple of releases so that it can be tried out and   stabilized before deprecating the old one. If the concern is about the file getting changed then that can be easily prevented (same is done for the old db schema files as well). All I am saying is if the file needs to be removed do it after a few releases by following the proper deprecation process.\n\n> > Second, command.properties does not permit the definition of new roles. Limiting users to 4 roles in a modern cloud environment is a barrier to CloudStack adoption.\n\n@jburwell Correct me if I am wrong but based on what I have seen in the code even after this feature there will still be 4 roles. I think what this feature allows is creating some grouping of permissions and assigning them a name. I can create a role with name \"Operator\" having say API1 and API2, someone else can create a role with same name but with API3 and API4. The same can be implemented as an independent plugin outside of cloudstack as well. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/215008749/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/215015234","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1408#issuecomment-215015234","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1408","id":215015234,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNTAxNTIzNA==","user":{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-27T08:51:01Z","updated_at":"2016-04-27T08:51:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@wido thanks, can you comment on how an acquired lock is released or it's not critical to release the lock at all?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/215015234/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/215017916","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1517#issuecomment-215017916","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1517","id":215017916,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNTAxNzkxNg==","user":{"login":"koushik-das","id":11499860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk5ODYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11499860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das","html_url":"https://github.com/koushik-das","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-27T09:00:08Z","updated_at":"2016-04-27T09:00:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Code changes LGTM.\n@swill The change is in upgrade code and CI won't be able to test it.

-- I'd say yes, that testing is good enough. If a test can determine that the default roles allow the expected access to the APIs then we're good.\n\nThere was some discussion of commands.properties deprecation in 2013. In particular, plugin developers had issues with the way it works. People should really have been using the annotations by now, but I believe it was not well communicated and the fact that commands.properties is still around has confused new developers. From the original discussion, the only reason it was left in place was in case users wanted to disable APIs entirely by setting the bitmask of an API to 0. Do we have that functionality covered now?\n\nhttp://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/cloudstack-dev/201310.mbox/%3C2B439486-9C4B-41B7-A698-B7ADE234B370@netapp.com%3E\n\nhttps://github.com/apache/cloudstack/commit/9f7b4884a7a0bf0b15d94777cff449fde4664af2\n\nNote also that existing installations are not being affected, they have to choose to use the new mechanism. In theory, I'm fine with some sort of staged transition where the dynamic checking is opt-in for a release, but I worry that it will perpetuate the issue we've seen since 2013, and puts a burden on the community to go back and clean up at some later date. For these reasons, I think if it's functionally identical on new installs and doesn't affect existing installs use of commands.properties, we should just cut over.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/215147096/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/215165382","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1489#issuecomment-215165382","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1489","id":215165382,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNTE2NTM4Mg==","user":{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-27T17:38:55Z","updated_at":"2016-04-27T17:38:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@mlsorensen \n- presently, setting bitmask to 0 in commands.properties does not disable the API but that no roles would have that API; though if an API through its `authroized` annotation enables itself for a roletype that will be considered\n- this feature implements a DENY rule that is checked before annotations are checked to provide a mechanism to disable an API (or group of APIs if a wildcard rule is used) that could have been enabled by the annotation (for example)\n\n@koushik-das \n- Existing users are not migrated automatically, they continue to use static-checker\n- Commands.properties file is only removed from codebase, after an upgrade this file won't be removed by the deb/rpm packages\n- New users and installations are no longer encouraged to use the old static-checker, therefore with the aim of deprecating the static-checker over time dynamic-checker is enabled by default\n- Any change can introduce side-effects and bugs but that does not mean we should stop innovating or stop improving cloudstack; such an attitude would be harmful for any project\n- I really appreciate your code review, improvement suggestions and testing feedback instead, on this PR.

FDs independently while `fcntl` (the lockf usage) treats them as same FDs. This means that when two processes could run the python script at the same time, no locking would actually occur. We don't get the advisory exclusive lock we want.\n\nI wrote a test program to demonstrate this: (for testing you may replace flock with lockf and see for yourself that it does not lock at all)\nhttps://gist.github.com/rhtyd/5d9983e7d58311ba8e517eefd931a507\n\nSo, my suggestion is to:\n- use flock instead of lockf, assuming and likely the file exists on local filesystem we can use `flock` with no issues\n- use the previously used open instead of with open, as `with open` syntax closes file when the statements under it return\n- at the end call the lock_file.close() optionally, otherwise on exiting file should be GC-ed and closed\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/215217268/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/215221441","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1304#issuecomment-215221441","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1304","id":215221441,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNTIyMTQ0MQ==","user":{"login":"swill","id":13644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill","html_url":"https://github.com/swill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-27T20:41:43Z","updated_at":"2016-04-27T20:41:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"### CI RESULTS\n\n```\nTests Run: 92\n  Skipped: 0\n   Failed: 4\n   Errors: 1\n```\n\n**Summary of the problem(s):**\n\n```\nERROR: Test restart network with cleanup\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/data/git/cs2/cloudstack/test/integration/component/test_vpc_network.py\", line 2848, in test_restart_network_with_cleanup\n    self.validateResult(result)\n  File \"/data/git/cs2/cloudstack/test/integration/component/test_vpc_network.py\", line 2742, in validateResult\n    if m.group(0) == ip and re.search(\"secondary\", line):\nAttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group'\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAdditional details in: /tmp/MarvinLogs/test_vpc_network_21FMEY/results.txt\n```\n\n```\nFAIL: Test redundant router internals\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/data/git/cs2/cloudstack/test/integration/smoke/test_routers_network_ops.py\", line 483, in test_02_RVR_Network_FW_PF_SSH_default_routes_egress_false\n    \"Attempt to retrieve google.com index page should be successful once rule is added!\"\nAssertionError: Attempt to retrieve google.com index page should be successful once rule is added!\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAdditional details in: /tmp/MarvinLogs/test_vpc_network_21FMEY/results.txt\n```\n\n```\nFAIL: Test network rules after starting a VpcVr that\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/data/git/cs2/cloudstack/test/integration/component/test_vpc_network.py\", line 2465, in test_02_start_vm_network_gc\n    \"Ping to outside world from VM should be successful\"\nAssertionError: Ping to outside world from VM should be successful\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAdditional details in: /tmp/MarvinLogs/test_vpc_network_21FMEY/results.txt\n```\n\n```\nFAIL: Test Stop all the Vms that are part of the a Network\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/data/git/cs2/cloudstack/test/integration/component/test_vpc_network.py\", line 2557, in test_03_restart_vpcvr\n    (self.public_ip_1.ipaddress.ipaddress, e))\nAssertionError: Failed to SSH into VM - 192.168.23.54, SSH connection has Failed.
