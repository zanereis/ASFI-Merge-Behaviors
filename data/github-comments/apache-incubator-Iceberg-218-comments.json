There's some bugfix on Protocols in the [release notes](https://docs.python.org/release/3.9.8/whatsnew/changelog.html) that might ring a bell with you?\r\n\r\nGreat catch! I wasn't aware of this! \r\n\r\nThe failed tests on Docker are because there is a single user in Docker. In the test, we create a file and then change the permissions in such a way that we don't have read permissions. However, if you run it in Docker, you're root, so the test doesn't work. We can either introduce another user in Docker, or mock the call to the filesystem.

However, we use Hadoop tables extensively for \r\n(1) Local testing since it is easy to view and modify metadata \r\n(2) Public read-only examples on remote FS like S3\r\n\r\nI think we should be able to replace usages of (1) by using a SQLLite DB + JDBCCatalog locally, or some equivalent SQLCatalog for Python. However, as long as there exists catalogs unsupported in Python, I think there should be some way for users to access their tables  in some limited fashion (like read-only as Fokko suggested).

Do you mean that I should create a transaction via Table.newTransaction() use it for do some stuff on the table and then in a next step do a Table.manageSnapshots(). I figured this would happen in 2 separate transaction then, one for the stuff going through the Transaction from Table.newTransaction() and then the stuff I do in the other Transaction from Table.manageSnapshot(). Do I get this wrong?\r\n\r\nWhat in fact I need is to do tasks from ManageSnapshots in the same transaction with other stuff through the Transaction interface (like updateProperties() in the same transaction with rollbackTo() in particular).\r\n\r\n**The motivation** here is kind of Impala vs HMS specific. When we are executing various `ALTER TABLE` statements on an Iceberg table we do it in a Transaction (things like expireSnapshots(), updateSchema() and others) but we observed that in the same Transaction we have to do an updateProperties() as well to set a new Catalog version. Doing this in the same transaction will generate a single Catalog event containing both changes, but in separate transactions this would generate multiple Catalog events where the catalog version update is in a separate event. Well, without going into even more Impala specific details this would cause us some headaches ([link](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IMPALA-11508) for one such issue).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1348180097/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1348577920","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/6090#issuecomment-1348577920","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/6090","id":1348577920,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85QYaqA","user":{"login":"ajantha-bhat","id":5889404,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODk0MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5889404?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat","html_url":"https://github.com/ajantha-bhat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-13T13:37:19Z","updated_at":"2022-12-13T13:37:19Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@rdblue, @findepi, @amogh-jahagirdar: Handled the comments.

Solutions would be\r\n1. Add a new interface to interface `IncrementalScan` to return an empty set.\r\n2. Reuse `IncrementalScan::fromSnapshotExclusive` by passing the latest/current snapshot id.

That's why Iceberg doesn't allow `NaN` as a literal value in expressions. If you try to create an expression with a [`NaN` literal, it will fail](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/master/api/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/expressions/Literals.java#L61).\r\n\r\nThat forces callers to be specific. If the caller intends to compare with `NaN`, then the comparison should be `false` and there's no need to pass it to Iceberg. If the caller intends to check whether a value is `NaN`, then there is the [`isNaN` unary predicate](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/master/api/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/expressions/Expressions.java#LL125C28-L125C28).\r\n\r\nIt is up to Flink how to map expressions. In Spark, `NaN` is a valid comparison, so Spark filter translation converts `x = NaN` to `isNaN(x)`. Flink could do something similar.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1354038557/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1354039711","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/6439#issuecomment-1354039711","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/6439","id":1354039711,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85QtQGf","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-16T01:13:45Z","updated_at":"2022-12-16T01:13:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think this was my mistake.
