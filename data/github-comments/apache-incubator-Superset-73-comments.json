As it turns out turning the charts into an .svg file is not trivial because the svg elements in the DOM are modified by external CSS. Converting the elements manually was a headache so luckily this module exists.\r\n\r\nThis feature is very useful to me so I went ahead an implemented it. If anyone wants to be able to turn a chart into an .svg file from the explore page, you can look at [my branch](https://github.com/SalehHindi/superset/tree/export-as-svg). I can make a pull request if you think that's a good idea @xrmx.\r\n\r\n@fufjvnvnf This won't convert an entire dashboard but this will do the trick for a slice. You can probably write a script to add the svg file to word or pdf. Converting a dashboard into any of those formats and even converting a slice into word or pdf formats raises a lot of issues. How should the slices be organized on the page?
