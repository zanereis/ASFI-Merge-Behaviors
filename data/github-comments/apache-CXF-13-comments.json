May I ask you please to take at look at https://github.com/apache/cxf/pull/756, it is based of `master` (without your changes) but illustrates the idea of how the processing could be separated. AFAIK it does not change or alter any public APIs, only the implementation details have been moved around.

... @ApplicationScoped or @RequestScoped should do he same and properly impl get(bean)) but otherwise looks good\r\n\r\n@rmannibucau thanks a lot for the feedback, so thought but here are some findings, in `JAXRSCdiResourceExtension`:\r\n- we create `PerRequestResourceProvider` when `isCxfSingleton(beanManager, bean)` is `false`\r\n-  in turn, `isCxfSingleton` checks the scope\r\n    ```\r\n    boolean isCxfSingleton(final BeanManager beanManager, final Bean<?> bean) {\r\n        return beanManager.isNormalScope(bean.getScope()) || isConsideredSingleton(bean.getScope());\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n- and `beanManager.isNormalScope(bean.getScope())` is `true` for all pre-predefined `@XxxScoped` scopes  because each of those has `@NormalScope` annotation as well\r\n\r\nSo I introduced the custom scope to trigger the `PerRequestResourceProvider`  flow. What do you think, see any issues with `isCxfSingleton` implementation?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/817359964/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/817360640","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cxf/pull/775#issuecomment-817360640","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/775","id":817360640,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxNzM2MDY0MA==","user":{"login":"rmannibucau","id":1249546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDk1NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1249546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau","html_url":"https://github.com/rmannibucau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-11T19:35:24Z","updated_at":"2021-04-11T19:35:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@reta hmm, both case are interesting but my point was that normal scoped beans are required to be proxied whereas others not.

So we want to provide the option to use POST for SSE events but the `SseEventSource` is GET-oriented and does not have the means to provide the request payload: this is by design and I believe we should not alter that anyhow. This is what the consumer of this API would expect. Probably, the conclusion is we have to define the APIs which would explicitly model SSE-over-POST, it should not be squeezed into `SseEventSource`. May be something along these lines:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic interface SsePostEventSource<?> {\r\n    void open(Entity<?> payload);\r\n    void close();\r\n    boolean isOpen();\r\n    void register(Consumer<InboundSseEvent> onEvent);\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, the important question is: what should happen on reconnect? Should the same request payload be sent to the endpoint over and over again? Or should it be up to consumer to decide? I inclined to think that we should use second option since it is very likely the payload could be outdated already. So the API should support that, again just rough idea:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    ...\r\n    void register(Provider<Entity<?>> onReconnect);\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut it may not be sufficient though, the LAST_EVENT_ID_HEADER could come very handy for example. Anyway, there are few things to think about, I hope it makes sense, thank you.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/857325700/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/866309160","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cxf/pull/818#issuecomment-866309160","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/818","id":866309160,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2NjMwOTE2MA==","user":{"login":"nrickles3","id":14063651,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDYzNjUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14063651?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrickles3","html_url":"https://github.com/nrickles3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrickles3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrickles3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrickles3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrickles3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrickles3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrickles3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrickles3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrickles3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrickles3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-22T20:25:51Z","updated_at":"2021-06-22T20:25:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The changes in this pull request have correctly fixed the issue described here https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CXF-8556.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/866309160/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/866362175","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cxf/pull/818#issuecomment-866362175","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/818","id":866362175,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2NjM2MjE3NQ==","user":{"login":"reta","id":509855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTg1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/509855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta","html_url":"https://github.com/reta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-22T21:53:31Z","updated_at":"2021-06-22T21:53:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@nrickles3 Thank you very much for confirming","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/866362175/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/867454259","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cxf/pull/812#issuecomment-867454259","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/812","id":867454259,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2NzQ1NDI1OQ==","user":{"login":"timothyjward","id":3882104,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODIxMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3882104?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothyjward","html_url":"https://github.com/timothyjward","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothyjward/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothyjward/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothyjward/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothyjward/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothyjward/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothyjward/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothyjward/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothyjward/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timothyjward/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-24T08:41:33Z","updated_at":"2021-06-24T08:41:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Are there any comments about this PR?

Any dependency resolver/validator (like `bnd`) must not fail if those optional dependencies are \"missing\".","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/874037932/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/874073362","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cxf/pull/805#issuecomment-874073362","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/805","id":874073362,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3NDA3MzM2Mg==","user":{"login":"rmannibucau","id":1249546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDk1NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1249546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau","html_url":"https://github.com/rmannibucau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmannibucau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-05T12:26:16Z","updated_at":"2021-07-05T12:26:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@brevilo provided is the way to say it is optional with maven, optional=true means it can be there or not and if i'm not mistaken was just introduced to please some tool but its usage is not unified whereas provided is clearly there to mean \"the project is not the one responsible to handle the presence of the dependency\" which is exactly what you are trying to achieve.
