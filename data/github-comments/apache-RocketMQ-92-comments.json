@zcsh0721 我和其他同学交流了一下，这个变更的目的是应对容器化部署环境下pid冲突的情况。想复用MQClientInstance可以手动设置instanceName。\r\n\r\n糟糕，我没看懂：“这个变更的目的是应对容器化部署环境下pid冲突的情况”。\r\n我目前知道的点是：同一个JVM下的生产者和消费者是同一个进程id。但不清楚为什么这么设计？\r\nclientid 由 ip 和 进程Id组成。如果在容器化部署的环境下，IP应该也是不同的吧。应该没错吧。\r\n所以“这个变更的目的是应对容器化部署环境下pid冲突的情况”，这个句话，我没看懂，望解答。","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1007346459/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1007358844","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/3727#issuecomment-1007358844","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/3727","id":1007358844,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl848CxN8","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-07T12:10:54Z","updated_at":"2022-01-07T12:10:54Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\n[![Coverage
