In the presence of rewrites and operator selection, it is not even clear to a user, at script level, which operations are affected. In addition, there are issues like converting inputs from double to float, which memory requirements are not capture by the memory estimates of the compiler. Finally, my major concern is that we only exploit low-hanging fruits like calling existing library functions without addressing the actual hard part of a full compiler and runtime integration for all operations.

Highlighting Mike's slack comment: `max(0, X)` explodes, `max(0.0, X)` works just fine, and `max(X, 0)` works just fine as well.\r\n- Implementation complexity: `n` times more operators to guarantee numerical stability (for example: if we are concerned with precision difference between sgemm and dgemm, then imagine the operation: float * double + int with kahan summation). \r\n\r\nNot supporting single-precision implies even a fair reviewer will always see a performance difference of 2-3x on CP (probably on GPU too). This difference is significant enough to shoo away deep learning users, where a typical training takes months.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/303533340/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/303538917","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/501#issuecomment-303538917","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/501","id":303538917,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMzUzODkxNw==","user":{"login":"krishnakalyan3","id":4648995,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDg5OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4648995?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/krishnakalyan3","html_url":"https://github.com/krishnakalyan3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krishnakalyan3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krishnakalyan3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krishnakalyan3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krishnakalyan3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krishnakalyan3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krishnakalyan3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krishnakalyan3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krishnakalyan3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krishnakalyan3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-23T21:34:04Z","updated_at":"2017-05-23T21:34:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@niketanpansare I am using maven3 :(.

you Arvind for addressing license early in development process.  Good catch removing opencsv-2.3.jar from list since no longer bundled in lib folder for current build.  Also good catch regarding newer protobuf.  However, new lines 247-250 could be confusing since they are detached from existing protobuf-java license text at lines 293-323.  Maybe just updating the protobuf-java version number from 2.5.0 to 3.2.0 at line 293 would be sufficient assuming the license text for version 3.2.0 hasn't changed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/304750102/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
