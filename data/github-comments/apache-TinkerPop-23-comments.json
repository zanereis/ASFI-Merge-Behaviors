We generate GraphSON and Gryo files that are statically checked into source control on each release. Then we make sure that those files can still be read with the current version. For example, we currently are verifying that 3.3.0-SNAPSHOT can read Gryo 1.0 generated in 3.3.0, 3.2.4 and 3.2.3. \r\n\r\nIn doing this, I've already encountered inconsistencies which are documented in the `Model` class which defines all the incompatibilities. So, if we do have a break (or something untestable), we can at least document it there. For example, there were a number of bugs in Gryo 1.0 that generated \"bad\" static files to test against. I made the fixes for 3.2.4, so we can really only test against versions 3.2.4 and later:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/TINKERPOP-1130/gremlin-tools/gremlin-io-test/src/main/java/org/apache/tinkerpop/gremlin/structure/io/Model.java#L100\r\n\r\nNote that the incompatibilities in the line referenced above also include \"untyped\" GraphSON there as untyped GraphSON won't deserialize to specific types either (typically just all coerces to `Map` and `List` without a way to deserialize back to the original type). \r\n\r\nActually, we still have some todos on this PR because of the changes we need to revert in the GraphSON 2.0 work you had done a while back on properties (those changes will be for GraphSON 3.0). That was a breaking change and the tests are failing so I think it's doing its job.\r\n\r\n> Does this verify that GraphSON and Gryo (and anything else down the line) have all the same serializers? (that is, are capable of handling all the same data -- e.g. we won't miss that Pick.none was not registered in 3.2.1 for GraphSON but it was for Gryo?)\r\n\r\nWell - I suppose it helps with this issue, but it's not as though it is actively monitoring our code to do that obviously. In other words, it will help if by convention we do all serialization testing through `gremlin-io-test`. If we do that, then we register a type with the `Model` and it will immediately force testing of both Gryo and GraphSON. If you didn't implement a serializer for one or the other then its going to fail.  If you just decide to add a new class registration to Gryo and don't bother to write a test for it in `gremlin-io-test` then obviously it's not going to have any knowledge of the new registration. \r\n\r\nI think that does lead to some issues which I'd brought up on the dev mailing list in the last couple of weeks. Right now there is some disparity between the types supported by GraphSON and those supported by Gryo. Right now Gryo has a lot more supported classes (many of which are not specifically tested under `gremlin-io-test) - I only covered those classes supported by GraphSON so far. I think that we will want Gryo and GraphSON to support the same types (for 3.0 of both formats) which may mean shrinking the types that Gryo supports (I would think we would want the smallest type library possible), but I'm not sure how practical that is. A lot of the Gryo registrations were added to support OLAP stuff and remote traversal stuff (before we had bytecode). I don't know how easy it is to just drop some of that stuff or which ones are even candidates to be dropped.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/270193003/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/270202449","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/494#issuecomment-270202449","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/494","id":270202449,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MDIwMjQ0OQ==","user":{"login":"dkuppitz","id":572377,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjM3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/572377?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz","html_url":"https://github.com/dkuppitz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-03T19:33:49Z","updated_at":"2017-01-03T19:33:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This is required to make it work:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndaniel@cube /projects/apache/tinkerpop (pr-494) $ git diff\r\ndiff --git a/docker/build/Dockerfile.template b/docker/build/Dockerfile.template\r\nindex 8364884..d32aa46 100644\r\n--- a/docker/build/Dockerfile.template\r\n+++ b/docker/build/Dockerfile.template\r\n@@ -21,3 +21,7 @@ RUN mkdir -p /usr/src/tinkerpop\r\n RUN curl -s https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py | python\r\n WORKDIR /usr/src/tinkerpop\r\n COPY . /usr/src/tinkerpop\r\n+RUN chmod 744 ./.travis.install-maven.sh\r\n+ENV M2_HOME /root/mvn-home\r\n+ENV PATH ${M2_HOME}/bin:${PATH}\r\n+RUN ./.travis.install-maven.sh 3.3.9 ${M2_HOME}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this should only go into `tp32`.

The way in which GraphSON serializes traversals is via their Bytecode. Thus, when the bytecode gets recompiled on the deserializing end, the `MultiComparator` is recreated. The reason this is needed in Gryo is because we use Gryo as the binary format internal to Java-based systems. Giraph and Spark register the `MultiComparator` in their Aggregator framework and Gryo is the serializer for it.\r\n\r\nRegarding `ProjectedTraverser`. Again, a concept internal to Gremlin-Java VM. Note that `Traverser` serialization in GraphSON is not complete regardless (only what is required for practical communication):\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Override\r\n        public void serialize(final Traverser traverserInstance, final JsonGenerator jsonGenerator, final SerializerProvider serializerProvider)\r\n                throws IOException {\r\n            jsonGenerator.writeStartObject();\r\n            jsonGenerator.writeObjectField(GraphSONTokens.BULK, traverserInstance.bulk());\r\n            jsonGenerator.writeObjectField(GraphSONTokens.VALUE, traverserInstance.get());\r\n            jsonGenerator.writeEndObject();\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\n`ProjectedTraverser` is used by `CollectingBarrierSteps` in OLAP during reductions. For Gremlin-Java VM applications, this is all Gryo serialization stuff with aggregator frameworks.\r\n\r\nFinally, regarding testing --- yes, I swapped out `ChainedComparator` for `MultiComparator + ProjectedTraverser` and thus, its tested.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/273760628/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/273809607","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/539#issuecomment-273809607","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/539","id":273809607,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MzgwOTYwNw==","user":{"login":"okram","id":148925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODkyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/148925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram","html_url":"https://github.com/okram","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-19T15:40:35Z","updated_at":"2017-01-19T15:40:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Just
