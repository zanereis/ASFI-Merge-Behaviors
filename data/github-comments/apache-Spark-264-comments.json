Based on Takuya's (correct) comment about hive length support for both binary and string: let us take a look at it first:\n\nFrom hive.o.a.h.h.ql.udf.UDFLength\n\n@Description(name = \"length\",\n        value = \"_FUNC_(str | binary) - Returns the length of str or number of bytes in binary data\",\n        extended = \"Example:\\n\"\n        + \"  > SELECT _FUNC_('Facebook') FROM src LIMIT 1;\\n\" + \"  8\")\n    @VectorizedExpressions({StringLength.class})\n    public class UDFLength extends UDF {\n      private final IntWritable result = new IntWritable();\n\n```\n  public IntWritable evaluate(Text s) {\n    if (s == null) {\n      return null;\n    }\n\n    byte[] data = s.getBytes();\n    int len = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < s.getLength(); i++) {\n      if (GenericUDFUtils.isUtfStartByte(data[i])) {\n        len++;\n      }\n    }\n\n    result.set(len);\n    return result;\n  }\n    public IntWritable evaluate(BytesWritable bw){\n    if (bw == null){\n      return null;\n\n    }\n    result.set(bw.getLength());\n    return result;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nSo in hive the invocations of length would be:\n\nString: select length(my_string) from some_table;\nbinary: select length(cast(my_string as binary)) from some_table;\n\nAs noted above - the result will likely not be consistent across all instances of hive: in particular hive on jdk6 should be having a different answer (I only have jdk 7 in my testing environment).  I am still pondering how to handle these differences.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50923836/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50924529","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1709#issuecomment-50924529","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1709","id":50924529,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwOTI0NTI5","user":{"login":"marmbrus","id":527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus","html_url":"https://github.com/marmbrus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-01T19:22:46Z","updated_at":"2014-08-01T19:22:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I haven't looked closely but if we can make it work by specifying more generic explicit return types to our implicits that seems like a good approach.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50924529/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50924539","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1666#issuecomment-50924539","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1666","id":50924539,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwOTI0NTM5","user":{"login":"RAbraham","id":214189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDE4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RAbraham","html_url":"https://github.com/RAbraham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RAbraham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RAbraham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RAbraham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RAbraham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RAbraham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RAbraham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RAbraham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RAbraham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RAbraham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-01T19:22:50Z","updated_at":"2014-08-01T19:22:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Sounds good.

As far as I can see there are several orthogonal improvements here:\n- Shuffle file consolidation fixes that Aaron copied in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1678\n- ExternalAppendOnlyMap fixes to deal with writes past end of stream; we also need these in ExternalSorter\n- Fixes to directory creation in DiskBlockManager (I'm still not sure when this would be a problem actually if all accesses to these directories are through getFile; needs some investigation)\n- Fixes to isSymlink (though as is this seems like it would only compile on Java 7)\n- Improvements to the API of DiskBlockObjectWriter\n\nOf these, the first two are most critical. So I'd like to get those into 1.1, and then we can do API refactoring and the other fixes on the master branch. For the directory creation fix I'd still like to understand when that can be a problem (I'm probably just missing something), but it's also one we can add in 1.1 during the QA window.\n\nI'm going to update the JIRA to create sub-tasks for these things so we can track where each one is fixed. Thanks again for putting this together Mridul, this is very helpful.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50929329/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50930229","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1697#issuecomment-50930229","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1697","id":50930229,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwOTMwMjI5","user":{"login":"shivaram","id":143893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0Mzg5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/143893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivaram","html_url":"https://github.com/shivaram","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivaram/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivaram/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivaram/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivaram/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivaram/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivaram/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivaram/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivaram/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivaram/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-01T20:19:21Z","updated_at":"2014-08-01T20:19:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I ran some microbenchmarks as outlined at https://gist.github.com/shivaram/63620c47f0ad50106e0a\nThe comments below the gist have some numbers that I got on my laptop.\n\nOverall I think we should just use a upper bound on the number of map tasks and not return any preferred locations if we have more than say 1000 map tasks.

Integrating with streamign unit tests is going to be a bit involved, so lets leave it for the future, 1.2, as more streaming + mllib stuff gets added.\n\nThis is very cool start to a hopefully new path. :D @mengxr Go ahead and merge it. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50934313/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50934577","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1481#issuecomment-50934577","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1481","id":50934577,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwOTM0NTc3","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-01T21:03:57Z","updated_at":"2014-08-01T21:03:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA results for PR 1481:<br>\\- This patch FAILED unit tests.<br>\\- This patch merges cleanly<br>\\- This patch adds no public classes<br><br>For more information see test ouptut:<br>https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/SparkPullRequestBuilder/17696/consoleFull\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50934577/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50934956","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1361#issuecomment-50934956","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1361","id":50934956,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwOTM0OTU2","user":{"login":"mengxr","id":829644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyOTY0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/829644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr","html_url":"https://github.com/mengxr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-01T21:07:55Z","updated_at":"2014-08-01T21:07:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@freeman-lab I think the static methods `StreamingLinearRegressionWithSGD.start` are not necessary, and these methods actually do not start anything.

I ran two experiments with different number of partitions, 1000 and 10000. For each experiment, I ran the following job 10 times, one immediately after another, and recorded the max queue length.\n\n```\nsc.parallelize(1 to 20000, numPartitions).persist().count()\n```\n\n**Before.** In the experiment with 1000-partition RDDs, the event queue length exceeded 10k at around the 6th job and eventually reached 18019 after the 10th job. These numbers are even higher for 10000-partition RDDs, where the event queue length already exceeded 10k by the 1st job, and finally reached _193162_ after the 10th. Under this (contrived) workload, even raising the event queue limit by 20x, as proposed in #1579, is not sufficient. These results are derived from commit 78f2af582286b81e6dc9fa9d455ed2b369d933bd in master. \n\n**After.** The event queue length never exceeded 507 for 1000 partitions and 786 for 10000 partitions. In both experiments, the number of events fit comfortably below 10k, the threshold before we start dropping events.\n\n**Baseline.** Without caching, the maximum queue length was 193 for 1000 partitions and 423 for 10000 partitions.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50946509/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50946639","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1679#issuecomment-50946639","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1679","id":50946639,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwOTQ2NjM5","user":{"login":"concretevitamin","id":592670,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MjY3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/592670?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/concretevitamin","html_url":"https://github.com/concretevitamin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/concretevitamin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/concretevitamin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/concretevitamin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/concretevitamin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/concretevitamin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/concretevitamin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/concretevitamin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/concretevitamin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/concretevitamin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-01T23:49:15Z","updated_at":"2014-08-01T23:49:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"How many listeners are used in these benchmarks?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50946639/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50946889","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1361#issuecomment-50946889","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1361","id":50946889,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwOTQ2ODg5","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-01T23:54:07Z","updated_at":"2014-08-01T23:54:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA tests have started for PR 1361.

This is because we still iterate through all the blocks there to find out how much memory each executor currently uses. We can fix this by incrementally updating memory and disk usage for non-RDD blocks similarly to what we have done in this PR for RDD blocks. However, this issue does not affect the event consumption rate and I may fix this separately.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50946913/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50946925","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1586#issuecomment-50946925","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1586","id":50946925,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwOTQ2OTI1","user":{"login":"javadba","id":410769,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMDc2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/410769?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javadba","html_url":"https://github.com/javadba","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javadba/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javadba/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javadba/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javadba/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javadba/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javadba/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javadba/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javadba/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javadba/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-01T23:54:49Z","updated_at":"2014-08-01T23:54:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Cleaned up now.
