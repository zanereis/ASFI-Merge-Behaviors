There are dependency conflicts being reported during the build by the enforcer plugin. Those will need to be resolved. Note that you might not have noticed them if you built with just `mvn clean install`. We don't automatically run the full tests for neo4j for a number of reasons, so you need to do `mvn clean install -DincludeNeo4j` - in case you're interested you can find a lot of this kind of information in our [developer documentation](http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/dev/developer/#building-testing).\r\n2.  is there any reason you didn't also modify `MultiMetaNeo4jTrait`? \r\n3.  are there tests that validate these changes somehow? There are `TextP` tests in the `HastTest` suite of `gremlin-test` but does anything in neo4j need to be configured for the string matching to work?\r\n4. I think this is a big enough change that we need some upgrade documentation. You can add that [here](https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/master/docs/src/upgrade/release-3.4.x.asciidoc#tinkerpop-341) - that pattern we use should be easy enough to follow to add a new section.

guess it is somewhat complicated. neo4j-contrib is not very active, currently, as fas as I know there is only one developer contributing to and maintaining it. the latest neo4j version used in [neo4j-tinkerpop-api-impl](https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-tinkerpop-api-impl) was updated to 3.4.0 in november 2018; since then not much has happened.\r\n\r\nthe feature implemented in this pull request would help us greatly in the project we are currently working in, and my intention was to share it with the community. as @spmallette pointed out, implementing it required changing some dependencies too, which is why new versions of [neo4j-tinkerpop-api](https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-tinkerpop-api) and [neo4j-tinkerpop-api-impl](https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-tinkerpop-api-impl) were released a few days ago.\r\n\r\nhowever, upgrading neo4j to the latest version (3.5.1) is quite another matter. i am afraid i will not be able to do it in the next days. i will fix the build (regarding enforcer problems) and update the pull request though.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/457097258/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/457196306","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1045#issuecomment-457196306","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1045","id":457196306,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NzE5NjMwNg==","user":{"login":"jorgebay","id":2931196,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MzExOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2931196?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay","html_url":"https://github.com/jorgebay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-24T13:28:53Z","updated_at":"2019-01-24T13:28:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Good

an odd way to deal with `ConcurrentModificationException` but the code that is throwing it is out of our hands so we can't really fix it at its source very well.

The concurrent modification should not be going on for hours on end i would think so it could be really short? Maybe set a limit that slowly introduces a `Thread.sleep()` in the catch that incrementally increases and ultimately just gives up and returns the `toString()` as something like \"yeah...this isn't happening\". then at least the loop would break in the worst possible case that we're not thinking of (or in control of) right now.  \r\n\r\nIf that's too much for such an off chance thing happening maybe we should log some portion of the retries (every 100th try or something?) in the `catch` so that at least the logs would have some notice of them happening and we'd know why a job was hanging?\r\n\r\nthoughts?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/457553336/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/457577704","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1044#issuecomment-457577704","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1044","id":457577704,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NzU3NzcwNA==","user":{"login":"dkuppitz","id":572377,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjM3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/572377?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz","html_url":"https://github.com/dkuppitz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-25T13:47:33Z","updated_at":"2019-01-25T13:47:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I can make it a `for` loop, retry at most 5 times, log every retry attempt and increase the pause between each retry.

We can still improve the other aspects later.\r\nSo: VOTE +1.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/462410371/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/462735775","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1057#issuecomment-462735775","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1057","id":462735775,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MjczNTc3NQ==","user":{"login":"IsaacBoy","id":8832426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MzI0MjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8832426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/IsaacBoy","html_url":"https://github.com/IsaacBoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IsaacBoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IsaacBoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IsaacBoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IsaacBoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IsaacBoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IsaacBoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IsaacBoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IsaacBoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IsaacBoy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-12T12:09:53Z","updated_at":"2019-02-12T12:09:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Cool.

This change just allows python to interpret/send the type. I'm not sure what is a breaking change here though. Right now, if Gremlin Server sends a `gx;Byte` python can't deserialize it and gremlin-python has no way to send a single `gx:Byte`.  isn't this an additive feature?  \r\n\r\nI suppose that maybe BigInteger might produce different behavior that could be considered breaking. Currently, `gx:BigInteger` coming from Gremlin Server won't be deserialized and I imagine results in error and if python has a number outside of 64bit size and sends it as `g:Long` it will fail to deserialize on Gremlin Server. So, behavior of numbers is a little different because they remove error conditions, but isn't that ok? \r\n\r\nor am i not thinking about something correctly? (entirely possibly that i am actually as i might be misunderstanding how python is handling some of this stuff given my middling knowledge of the language)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/463189263/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/463220534","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1060#issuecomment-463220534","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1060","id":463220534,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MzIyMDUzNA==","user":{"login":"aboudreault","id":532356,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjM1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/532356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aboudreault","html_url":"https://github.com/aboudreault","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aboudreault/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aboudreault/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aboudreault/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aboudreault/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aboudreault/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aboudreault/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aboudreault/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aboudreault/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aboudreault/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-13T14:32:51Z","updated_at":"2019-02-13T14:32:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"oh, right.. at the moment the user will get back a non-deserialized `{''@type': 'gx:Byte', '@value': 42}`.
