Sorry it's taken me so long to get around to reviewing it! I did a quick test and it does work correctly. However, I'm a bit concerned about the fact that it returns the entire script body if it matches. While this is the same behavior if the \"Script Body\" property is set, I feel like if a file is specified, there's a much higher likelihood that the script is quite large. What do you think about only returning the line in the script that matches? Or, rather, a match for each line in the script body that matches?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/505930658/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/505979773","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3554#issuecomment-505979773","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3554","id":505979773,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNTk3OTc3Mw==","user":{"login":"MikeThomsen","id":108184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODE4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen","html_url":"https://github.com/MikeThomsen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-26T17:53:33Z","updated_at":"2019-06-26T17:53:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mattyb149

The idea here is that the `nifi-groovyx-*` and `nifi-scripting-*` can be upgraded to new versions of Groovy without having to use the same version in NiFi or NiFi Toolkit until we're ready to update the tests/utils in NiFi and NiFi Toolkit written in Groovy.  This changes also makes it a bit easier to manage a Groovy upgrade in NiFi or NiFi Toolkit.  Rather than copying all the modules specified in `groovy-all`'s POM individually to NiFi module POMs, `groovy-all` can be upgraded, along with the few Groovy modules that are referenced individually, by changing the appropriate `groovy.version` property.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/506819978/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/506863907","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3558#issuecomment-506863907","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3558","id":506863907,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNjg2MzkwNw==","user":{"login":"jtstorck","id":19271493,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjcxNDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19271493?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck","html_url":"https://github.com/jtstorck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-28T20:16:59Z","updated_at":"2019-06-28T20:16:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Reviewing...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/506863907/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/506892312","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3558#issuecomment-506892312","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3558","id":506892312,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNjg5MjMxMg==","user":{"login":"jtstorck","id":19271493,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjcxNDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19271493?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck","html_url":"https://github.com/jtstorck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-28T22:13:51Z","updated_at":"2019-06-28T22:13:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Initial tests run with the PR changes look good.

this PR, the main one being TLS version 1.2 and 1.3.  When this PR was originally created, TLSv1.3 was not working on Java 11.  More investigation and testing is needed to resolve this, as NiFi on Java 11 should work with TLSv1.3.\r\n\r\nAnother issue is the ignoring of the RecordLookup tests, and the issue that was causing the error has since been fixed on master.  I'll rerun those tests and verify that they work again.\r\n\r\nA third issue regarding components that do not support Java 11 yet (Ignite, ActiveMQ) may not be resolved before this PR is merged to master.  This will be an issue for those that want to build and run NiFi on Java 11 and use those components.  Those components should work fine if NiFi is built on Java 8.

I've left some follow up comments in my previous feedback. A couple of other items:\r\n\r\n- Asked earlier but did not see any response... What are your thoughts on automatically setting the parameter context on newly created Process Groups based on the currently bound parameter context in the parent Process Group? Since parameters are not inherited, this could be a convenient feature if users would expect this behavior. There is a downside to consider that changing the bound parameter context would be cumbersome but this downside would exist regardless if this convenience were implemented.\r\n- When updating a Process Group to bind a Parameter Context, I am able to even if I do not have access to that Process Group. I think we need to update this and perform this check.\r\n- When updating a Process Group to bind a Parameter Context, I am able to even if that Parameter Context has affected components that I do not have access to. I think we need to update this and perform these checks.\r\n- When updating a Process Group to unbind a Parameter Context, I am able to even if I do not have access to that Process Group. This check is questionable in my opinion. We do require permissions to a referenced Controller Service when it is being dereferenced. So I could see adding that check here too however with Controller Services they can be affected by the components referencing them. This is not really the case here but I still think it seems reasonable to add.\r\n- When updating a Process Group to unbind a Parameter Context, I am able to even if that Parameter Context has affected components that I do not have access to. I think we need to update this and perform these checks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/509724215/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/509741743","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3547#issuecomment-509741743","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3547","id":509741743,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwOTc0MTc0Mw==","user":{"login":"thenatog","id":38888042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg4MDQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38888042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog","html_url":"https://github.com/thenatog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-09T17:52:24Z","updated_at":"2019-07-09T17:52:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Will review.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/509741743/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/509952263","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3578#issuecomment-509952263","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3578","id":509952263,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwOTk1MjI2Mw==","user":{"login":"ijokarumawak","id":1107620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak","html_url":"https://github.com/ijokarumawak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-10T07:53:35Z","updated_at":"2019-07-10T07:53:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@markap14 Thank you for taking a look!

From a User Experience point of view, it's probably a good idea. The only real concern that I have is that in order to do that, we'd have to first receive the request, determine if the user has permissions to the parent group's Parameter Context, and if so, set it on the request before replicating. If any node then determined that the user doesn't have the READ policy for the Parameter Context (of course different nodes could see the permissions differently if they are periodically syncing with an external authority provider), then the result will be that the request is rejected. So the user has all permissions that they should, and the request still gets rejected due to insufficient permissions, because they don't have READ on the parent's Parameter Context. Now, this is certainly a corner case, so if you think we should go ahead and do this anyway I'm happy to make the change. But wanted to just run that scenario by you and get your feedback on that first.\r\n\r\nRegarding permissions of Binding & Un-binding: you're right - the current approach is inconsistent with how it works with Controller Services.

The parameters are the GC interval\nfor the NiFi JVM, the max number of open sockets for your OS, and a Put\nrate that is high enough to exceed the max number of open sockets within\nthe GC interval. How one puts this all together is beyond me. However, I've\nprovided a detailed explanation of the problem in the ticket and\nexamination of the code, with the understanding that the connections are\ncached, reveals the existence of a resource leak.\n\nWhile there may be better ways to deal with the cached connections, given\nthe API I have to work with what I've offered is my best effort to deal\nwith the problem.\n\n\nSteve\n\nOn Fri, Jul
