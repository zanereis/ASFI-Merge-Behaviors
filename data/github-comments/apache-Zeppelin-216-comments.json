The executor is out of control of zeppelin.  That's why this approach here only works for python interpreter which zeppelin can control its python environment.

are right, for the pyspark zeppelin interpreter we should use `spark.archives` to enable the python (conda) environment.\r\nFor the python zeppelin interpreter we should use a configuration parameter that does almost the same as the spark equilant.\r\n\r\n> But for python interpreter, I don't think there's unified approach for that for now. Buy we can introduce unified configuration for that. e.g. We can introduce `python.archive` which will be translated to yarn/k8s specific configuration.\r\n\r\nThe current approach seems to load the conda environment into the HDFS, which seems to be quite effective as the Zeppelin server and the Zeppelin interpreter process within YARN share the same content.\r\nA common way for docker, K8s and YARN could be a dynamic download starting from the Zeppelin interpreter just before it starts the Python process.\r\nAt the moment I don't know if `spark.archives` supports a download via HTTP. I will find out as soon as possible. If this is possible, `python.archive` should also do the download so that you don't have to pack python (conda) environments several

This is indeed not the root cause of the connection leak. I will close this PR and investigate other reasons for the connection leak.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/842091804/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/842098452","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/4119#issuecomment-842098452","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/4119","id":842098452,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0MjA5ODQ1Mg==","user":{"login":"cuspymd","id":8870299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NzAyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8870299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuspymd","html_url":"https://github.com/cuspymd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuspymd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuspymd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuspymd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuspymd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuspymd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuspymd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuspymd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuspymd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuspymd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-17T07:51:14Z","updated_at":"2021-05-17T07:51:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@xiejiajun Thanks for your checking too.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/842098452/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/842189288","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/4089#issuecomment-842189288","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/4089","id":842189288,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0MjE4OTI4OA==","user":{"login":"PrarthiJain","id":46317159,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MzE3MTU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46317159?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrarthiJain","html_url":"https://github.com/PrarthiJain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrarthiJain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrarthiJain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrarthiJain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrarthiJain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrarthiJain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrarthiJain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrarthiJain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrarthiJain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrarthiJain/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-17T09:55:01Z","updated_at":"2021-05-17T09:55:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Reamer @zjffdu @prabhjyotsingh.
