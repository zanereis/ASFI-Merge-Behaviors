PR #1245 added `extra-launch-classpath` arg,which means we dont need to copy hadoop-lib jars any more to submit topo on Yarn mode after 0.14.3 version released.  \nSubmitting command will be:\n\n```\nheron submit yarn ~/.heron/examples/heron-examples.jar com.twitter.heron.examples.ExclamationTopology ExclamationTopology --extra-launch-classpath <extra-classpath-value>\n```\n\nNo matter which version of Heron you use, **there is something you should pay attention to** if you want to submit topo to Yarn(Hadoop 2.7.x).\n\nFor `localfs-statemgr`\n- The `common-cli` jar’s version should be greater than or equal to `1.3.1`. \n\nFor `zookeeper-statemgr`\n- The `common-cli` jar’s version should be greater than or equal to `1.3.1`. \n- The `curator-framework` jar's version should be greater than or equal to `2.9.0`\n- The `curator-client` jar's version should be greater than or equal to `2.9.0`\n\nSince perhaps the most popular Hadoop version is 2.7.x , which uses common-cli-1.2.1,curator-framework-2.7.1 and curator-client-2.7.1. \n\nThe YARN scheduler doc should be updated for the latest version later.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/246893766/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/246910717","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1349#issuecomment-246910717","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1349","id":246910717,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NjkxMDcxNw==","user":{"login":"ashvina","id":10034060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDM0MDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10034060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashvina","html_url":"https://github.com/ashvina","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashvina/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashvina/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashvina/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashvina/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashvina/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashvina/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashvina/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashvina/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashvina/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-14T05:32:04Z","updated_at":"2016-09-14T05:32:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mycFelix Your answer is complete and accurate.

Client fetches current packing plan from state manager and sends it and proposed changes to scheduler when invoking `update`.\n2. `UpdateTopologyManager` receives request and takes out a local lock.

This is to confirm that the system state hasn't changed since the request was initiated by another agent. If the packing plans don't match, returns a concurrent update exception response.\n4. `UpdateTopologyManager` updates the topology info in the state manager to invoke the scaling change.\n5. `UpdateTopologyManager` releases the local lock and returns success.\n\n### Approach 2 - local lock with update request versioning\n\nThis approach is similar to approach 1, except an atomically incremented request id is used instead of the current packing plan comparison.\n1.

It's more aggressive in that we might fail even when handling the \"next in line\", but it's simple to implement and rationalize. Also it's easy to recover from with another request.\n\nSince these ids are numerically increasing it's tempting to use them to infer ordering, but I recommend we use them just as atomic optimistic locks on the request/response cycle.\n\nIf that's the case, it really does make approach 1 and 2 similar, except that 2 requires additional state

What we need to do is adding `today-start-offset` key-value to the map data. We do not increase the number of write times. What we increased is the number of bytes of map data.\n\nTopology will never read the key `today-start-offset`  from the ZK on its own. When something goes wrong, we copy the `today-start-offset` value to the `offset` key by `zk-cli-command` and restart the topology. Spouts will read the `offset` value from ZK and restart.\n\nThe `today-start-offset`  just gives our user a chance to change their topology and re-calculated the statistical

Besides, the extra-launch-classpath arg couldn't handle strings with '*', as your another issue said. How can I deal with the situation with the current 0.14.3 version?\n2、How to update the common-cli and curator jars to higher version? Will it be ok that download higher version jars and replace the lower ones? Or should I update them through other ways?\nThanks again for your patient help!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/247928555/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
