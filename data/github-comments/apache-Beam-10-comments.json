Specifically, do you agree on this order of things:\n1. Do this move now.\n2. Leverage `TestPipeline` to immediately increase test coverage to include this runner.\n3. Annotate tests appropriately with `NeedsRunner`\n4. Delete `DirectPipelineRunner` from the SDK.\n\nExpect some hiccups along the way. I'm sure that we will have to learn during set up of item 2, and that item 4 will feed back into item 3 since we will miss some.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/215252387/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/215259675","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/243#issuecomment-215259675","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/243","id":215259675,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNTI1OTY3NQ==","user":{"login":"davorbonaci","id":8442684,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NDI2ODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8442684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davorbonaci","html_url":"https://github.com/davorbonaci","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davorbonaci/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davorbonaci/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davorbonaci/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davorbonaci/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davorbonaci/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davorbonaci/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davorbonaci/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davorbonaci/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davorbonaci/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-27T23:08:58Z","updated_at":"2016-04-27T23:08:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"LGTM\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/215259675/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/215262725","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/247#issuecomment-215262725","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/247","id":215262725,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNTI2MjcyNQ==","user":{"login":"swegner","id":674021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NDAyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/674021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner","html_url":"https://github.com/swegner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-27T23:26:38Z","updated_at":"2016-04-27T23:26:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've addressed all feedback so far.

(This is particularly because I'm not sure all tests will actually work on the new runner right now -- they may soon.)\n\nWe should coordinate with pending PRs from @tgroh. I'm fine whichever order you decide to proceed in.\n\nNote that the official name of the runner will be `DirectRunner`, without `Pipeline` or `InProcess`.

We can defer this to a later point.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/216022812/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/216118285","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/257#issuecomment-216118285","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/257","id":216118285,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNjExODI4NQ==","user":{"login":"dhalperi","id":526415,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNjQxNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/526415?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi","html_url":"https://github.com/dhalperi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-02T06:53:16Z","updated_at":"2016-05-02T06:53:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Agree with Kenn.

If you look at my previous commits, you can see those were backed by JIRA issues. The commits in this PR are soon to be removed fixes as long as we don't have all the IO available in Beam.
