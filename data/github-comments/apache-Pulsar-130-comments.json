This was tested by doing a simple nslookup on the AWS ELB URL. If you were trying with the address in the original post that has changed (my apologies. Looking to create a CNAME to abstract code from these changes).  The new address is `ab30d3c79aee611e9acf102a8b3fc243-31673255.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com`.  It resolves into 3 IP addresses. Moreover, if I pick one of the 3 IP addresses and use it in the same code instead of the ELB URL the code works.

Hi Jerry, thank you very much for your comment. When we change the word, we just want to apply a technical writing principle: \"Use a prepositional phrase instead of an apostrophe and the letter s (’s) to show the possessive form of abbreviations, brand names, product names, or inanimate objects.\"\r\nWe should have paid attention to \"Pulsar Functions\" and \"a Pulsar Function\". Thank you very much for your kind reminder.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/516659724/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/516661183","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/4820#issuecomment-516661183","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/4820","id":516661183,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNjY2MTE4Mw==","user":{"login":"Jennifer88huang-zz","id":47805623,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODA1NjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47805623?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz","html_url":"https://github.com/Jennifer88huang-zz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-31T01:53:03Z","updated_at":"2019-07-31T01:53:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"run integration tests\r\nrun java8 tests","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/516661183/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/516662531","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/4847#issuecomment-516662531","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/4847","id":516662531,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNjY2MjUzMQ==","user":{"login":"congbobo184","id":39078850,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MDc4ODUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39078850?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/congbobo184","html_url":"https://github.com/congbobo184","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/congbobo184/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/congbobo184/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/congbobo184/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/congbobo184/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/congbobo184/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/congbobo184/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/congbobo184/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/congbobo184/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/congbobo184/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-31T01:59:41Z","updated_at":"2019-07-31T01:59:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"\r\n\r\n\r\n> @congbobo184 as we discussed in the previous pull request (the primitive one), we agreed on that we want to improve the schema implementation (to support ByteBuf and ByteBuffer) before changing the json and avro schema support in presto.
