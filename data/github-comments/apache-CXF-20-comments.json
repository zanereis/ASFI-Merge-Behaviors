So what I've done:\r\n - created a branch called `CXF-8671` where I just bumped the version to 4.1.0-SNAPSHOT (so all unrelated changes are gone from this pull request)\r\n - retargeted pull request to `CXF-8671` instead of `main` so we could actually merge it and continue to work iteratively\r\n\r\nThere are few leftovers on my side (related to JAX-RS) but there is only one thing I wanted to change: the usage of Jakarta EE BOM simplifies a few things but really complicates dependency updates, especially with respect to security fixes. I think we should be better of continuing to manage individual component versions instead (it happens all the time that we need to update components, without need to wait for BOM release which usually takes much longer).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/1786264930/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/1788134786","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cxf/pull/1498#issuecomment-1788134786","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/1498","id":1788134786,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQMOR85qlMWC","user":{"login":"sebastian-violet","id":71724508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNzI0NTA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71724508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-violet","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastian-violet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-violet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-violet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-violet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-violet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-violet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-violet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-violet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-violet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-violet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-31T22:43:16Z","updated_at":"2023-10-31T22:43:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@reta
