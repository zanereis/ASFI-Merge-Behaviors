Hudi's upgrade handler will execute the upgrade steps automatically upon first commit with the newer version. However, the first commit could take slightly more time because in version 0.11.0 [metadata table](https://hudi.apache.org/docs/metadata) was enabled and hence metadata table will be created by default. Also, the mechanism of creating metadata table changed in 0.10.0. Any subsequent commits will be as usual. Though metadata table is a useful thing, but at this point if you're not sure whether to enable it or not, you can set `hoodie.metadata.enable` to false while writing using the newer Hudi version.\r\n\r\nI just ran two upserts for a COW table with 0.5.3 and then another with 0.12.0 with default configs. It was pretty seamless.

Then there is ni file to clean. Then no clean commit in the timeline. Then no incremental commit. Then full partition scan. \r\n\r\n\r\n> I guess there is a problem to use incremental cleaning together with KEEP_LATEST_COMMITS which lead to never clean some partitions after a first clean\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/6498\r\n\r\n\r\n> you can leverage hoodie.clean.max.commits to reduce the frequency w/ which cleaner runs\r\n\r\nHere comes the problem: so far with OCC the cleaner is the only to rollback dead inflight commits. Then if I run cleaner less frequently those dead commit block the MDT compaction, which lead to increase the files to merge during MOR, and decrease MDT performances including cleaning. In my case I get often such dead commit since our platform often sigkill spark jobs. If I never run cleaning, those commit never leave and so the hfiles to merge. \r\n\r\n> I have put up a fix to leverage metadata table incase of LATEST_FILE_VERSIONS.\r\n\r\nIf this fix makes cleaning W/ MDT faster then it yes that would solve my issue. \r\nBut I don't think so. The reason is the method you replaced is not the bottleneck. The time is spent in asking the MDT for files to delete in that method: https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/6e7ac457352e007939ba3c44c9dc197de7b88ed3/hudi-client/hudi-client-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/table/action/clean/CleanPlanner.java#L439\r\nWhich is called here, \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/52e63b39d6189beb3b381944ed553bb0052b12c9/hudi-client/hudi-client-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/table/action/clean/CleanPlanActionExecutor.java#L113\r\nThe cleaner first list partitions and then for each part list the parquet files. Those lookup are slow when you have 100k partition compared to lookup the file system. The more files to merge the MDT has, the slower the cleaning is ! \r\n\r\nAgain on the same table: clean w/ MDT with 4 log files: 4h\r\nClean w/o MDT 5min.\r\n Then full file listing is quite fast.\r\n\r\nIt would be helpful if we can configure cleaning method . in my case (100k partitions) I dlike to get MDT enabled but use pure file system for cleaning. \r\n\r\nOn August 30, 2022 11:41:19 PM UTC, Sivabalan Narayanan ***@***.***> wrote:\r\n>and wrt your statement `Also I guess there is a problem to use incremental cleaning together with KEEP_LATEST_COMMITS which lead to never clean some partitions after a first clean but I will open a separate issue for this one.`, if you happen to create a new issue, let me know. do tag me in there. \r\n>\r\n>-- \r\n>Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\n>https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/6373#issuecomment-1232280621\r\n>You are receiving this because you were mentioned.\r\n>\r\n>Message ID: ***@***.***>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1234243547/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1234433171","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/6568#issuecomment-1234433171","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/6568","id":1234433171,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5Jk_ST","user":{"login":"hudi-bot","id":79415918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDE1OTE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79415918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/hudi-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-01T15:22:59Z","updated_at":"2022-09-01T15:22:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\nMeta data\n{\n  \"version\" : 1,\n  \"metaDataEntries\" : [ {\n    \"hash\" : \"0480fc1baf0cde98947bd17a96e7e3a25631d469\",\n    \"status\" : \"SUCCESS\",\n    \"url\" : \"https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=11090\",\n    \"triggerID\" : \"0480fc1baf0cde98947bd17a96e7e3a25631d469\",\n    \"triggerType\" : \"PUSH\"\n  } ]\n}-->\n## CI report:\n\n* 0480fc1baf0cde98947bd17a96e7e3a25631d469 Azure: [SUCCESS](https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=11090) \n\n<details>\n<summary>Bot commands</summary>\n  @hudi-bot supports the following commands:\n\n -

Thanks for the RFC submission. Merge logic is going to be well abstracted and can be custom implemented once [RFC-46](https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/6132) lands (it is very close to landing). I suggest you should rethink the problem after the HoodieMerge interface is in place and see if this combining logic is generic enough to implement it within Hudi. \r\n\r\ncc @alexeykudinkin ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1234501378/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1234510864","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/6550#issuecomment-1234510864","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/6550","id":1234510864,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5JlSQQ","user":{"login":"codope","id":16440354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQwMzU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16440354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope","html_url":"https://github.com/codope","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-01T16:26:19Z","updated_at":"2022-09-01T17:01:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@alexeykudinkin The build for `spark3` profile failed for me locally.
