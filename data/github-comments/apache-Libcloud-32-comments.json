Now requests is a higher level API so connect is only called lazily if the connection instance hasn't been set. In the case of the openstack auth, it has. So the host property would be loaded at init but then when the catalog is fetched, the property doesn't trickle down to the instance of the requests session.\r\nAdding `connect()` to each call for the internal method that unpacks the catalog would fix this issue but might add a small overhead to each call since it's in morph_action_hook. But that takes it back to the speed of <2.0 anyway.
