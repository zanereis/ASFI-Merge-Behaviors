The evolutionary approach is to add a new API along side the existing ones.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1372108935/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1372241367","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/issues/1293#issuecomment-1372241367","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/1293","id":1372241367,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec5Ryr3X","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-05T13:52:52Z","updated_at":"2023-01-05T13:52:52Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@mr-c  Which parts of Jena do you use?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1372241367/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1372251376","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/issues/1704#issuecomment-1372251376","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/1704","id":1372251376,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec5RyuTw","user":{"login":"a14n","id":1206632,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDY2MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1206632?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/a14n","html_url":"https://github.com/a14n","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a14n/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a14n/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a14n/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a14n/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a14n/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a14n/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a14n/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a14n/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a14n/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-05T14:01:41Z","updated_at":"2023-01-05T14:01:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue is indeed a dup of [JENA-1601](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JENA-1601) and my concern was exactly what the description explained.\r\n\r\nBut I also raised this issue to _detect_ more easily issue like #1670.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1372251376/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1372320171","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/issues/1704#issuecomment-1372320171","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/1704","id":1372320171,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec5Ry_Gr","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-05T14:53:25Z","updated_at":"2023-01-05T14:53:25Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@a14n - have you observed any effects of not closing partially consumed iterators?

Or if it's using Taverna for the research objects files, and Jena4 graphs for the CWL workflow (I **hope** that's what it's doing). I've created an issue to sort out these two versions of Jena in the CWL Viewer later (it has other things in the pipeline, Spring Data 3 upgrade, newer versions of hibernate/postgres, migration of servers, etc).\r\n\r\n@afs coming back to changelog in Jena;\r\n\r\n>>Could be nice to move the CHANGELOG in the code itself so that it's not necessary to be registered on the mailing list to easily get it. It could also be retrieved by tools like RenovateBot or similar that automatically suggest dependencies upgrade.\r\n>\r\n>What other tools are there?\r\n>Specifically, what does github use to populate the dependabot PR with change information?\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, it parses the changelog from files in the source code repo. I knew it used `CHANGELOG`. I looked at their docs but it was not clear, so had a look at their source code. This is the list of files they appear to accept:\r\n\r\n- [`changelog news changes history release whatsnew releases`](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/blob/0603ec94756a975b2ea928acf7a74213198599be/common/lib/dependabot/metadata_finders/base/changelog_finder.rb#L17-L20) (the extension doesn't seem to matter)\r\n\r\nIn each of those files, it uses a \"pruner\" to locate the desired version: https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/blob/0603ec94756a975b2ea928acf7a74213198599be/common/lib/dependabot/metadata_finders/base/changelog_finder.rb#L124\r\n\r\nThat's what I could understand. So I think having a `CHANGELOG.md` file in the root of the Jena repository, neighbor to README and LICENSE, would include our changelog in dependabot. For non-dependabot users, I think most people are familiar with, and look for these files.\r\n\r\nOn how to generate these files;\r\n\r\nI think we could try to automate it if it's really hard to keep track of the changes, maybe extract it from Git and/or JIRA. But I think it could be simpler to decide what to include when merging pull requests.\r\n\r\nWe could update our pull request template to include a line like:\r\n\r\n- `CHANGES.md` entry included if this is a change that can affect users\r\n\r\nTo remind us whether we should include something in the changelog. This way, `main` would always have the snapshot changelog, and during the release we would have to remember to update the changelog entry (date/version). And after the release start a new changelog for the next version…\r\n\r\nNot sure if that would complicate much the release process.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1374143735/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1374161477","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/issues/1710#issuecomment-1374161477","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/1710","id":1374161477,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec5R6ApF","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-06T21:36:00Z","updated_at":"2023-01-06T21:36:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Try `IsoMatcher.isomorphic(Graph, Graph)`. `IsoMatcher` handles quoted triples correctly.\r\n\r\n`IsoMatcher` is a naive (= simplistic back tracking) on collections of list of terms.

It was easier to adapt to RDF-star and applies to more than just graphs.\r\n\r\n`RDFStar.encodeAsRDF` introduces a URN per unique quoted triple and the URN is based on the hash of quoted triple which makes the URN sensitive to the blank node label.

My proposal looks like this but maybe someone has already better ideas:\r\n> \r\n> ```java\r\n> // D = domain tuple type (e.g. Quad or Tuple<NodeId), C = component type (e.g. Node or NodeId)\r\n> interface TupleMatcher4<D, C> {\r\n>   TupleStreamer<D, C> find(C g, C s, C p, C o, boolean distinct, int ... projectedColumns);\r\n> }\r\n> \r\n> interface TupleStreamer<D, C> {\r\n>   Iterator<C> asComponents(); // e.g. Node or NodeIds\r\n>   Iterator<D> asDomainTuples(); // e.g. Quad\r\n>   Iterator<Tuple<C>> asGenericTuples();\r\n> }\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nI don't suspect that this sort of low level execution optimisation is ever going to bubble up into the high level end-user APIs like `DatasetGraph`\r\n\r\nI don't disagree that this iterator could be used to optimise execution of other query patterns **but** the goal here is to start small and incrementally improve.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> This way a request for e.g. distinct predicates:\r\n> \r\n> ```sparql\r\n> SELECT DISTINCT ?p { GRAPH ?g { ?s ?p ?o } }\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> could then map to a `find()` call such as\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> Iterator<Node> distinctPredicates = datasetGraph.find(ANY, ANY, ANY, ANY, true, 2).asComponents();\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> Furthermore, I wonder if the way TDB indexes data would be suitable for a skip scan for the case to retrieve a resource's distinct predicates:\r\n> \r\n> ```sparql\r\n> SELECT DISTINCT ?p { GRAPH ?g { <concreteS> ?p ?o } }\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> The background is, that we have resources with 4mio+ statements (yeah not that usual) where a scan for distinct predicates takes seconds - maybe with the skip scan it would also be possible to speed this case up?\r\n\r\nSo as I used to tell a solution architect I worked closely with in a past $dayjob that optimisation is fundamentally a trade off. The goal of a general purpose optimiser is to apply optimisations that are generally useful to most users and most data yielding performance improvements for the general case.\r\n\r\nDetecting whether an optimisation is applicable or not has a non-zero cost to it and for some query/dataset patterns that are unusual, e.g. a subject with 4 million statements, a general purpose optimiser shouldn't try to optimise for that because it's so outside it's normal expectations.\r\n\r\nI would suggest for this kind of optimisation, where you have a specific query pattern that runs poorly on your dataset(s), you consider creating your own custom optimiser (based off ARQ's default one) adding in optimisations for specific query patterns you need specialised optimisation for.  You can transform those into custom `Op` instances (derived from ARQs `OpExt` extension point) and provide suitable `eval()` implementations that can call into the relevant low level APIs as appropriate.\r\n\r\nThat gives you a way to experiment with some of these things outside of the Jena codebase and then potentially contribute them back later if they prove to be of more general value.
