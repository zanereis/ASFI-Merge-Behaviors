I think both Max and Fabian have a valid point. This will lead to unexpected behaviour like `a.union(b)` working, but then `b.union(a)` throwing a `NullPointerException`.\n\nIf you want, you can add an extra null check with a better error message in case of a `null`. Otherwise, I think we can close this PR.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/129357904/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/129358588","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1001#issuecomment-129358588","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1001","id":129358588,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyOTM1ODU4OA==","user":{"login":"uce","id":1756620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTY2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1756620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce","html_url":"https://github.com/uce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-10T08:19:07Z","updated_at":"2015-08-10T08:19:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm going to merge this.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/129358588/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/129363319","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/996#issuecomment-129363319","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/996","id":129363319,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyOTM2MzMxOQ==","user":{"login":"uce","id":1756620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTY2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1756620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce","html_url":"https://github.com/uce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-10T08:30:47Z","updated_at":"2015-08-10T08:30:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for all the information Robert! I will have a more detailed look at the classes you mentioned until you are back. Regarding the open questions:\n\n1) Copying code\n- I don't see a problem with this in general. I would assume that the copied solution will lead to less surprises in the end. After the new API is released by Kafka, we can remove the code, right?\n\n2) Packaging\n- I think it's OK with proper documentation and as you said we have to do it anyways at some point in time.\n\n---\n\nI've started a discussion about a bug fix release for 0.9.

I would like to implement the fixed size sampling with only one pass through source dataset, since while user try to sample a dataset, the dataset should be quite large in most cases, pass through the dataset multi times would add much more effort. In my solution, the basic idea of fixed size sample in distributed stream is that: generate a random number for each input elements as its weight, select top K elements with max weight, as the weights are generated randomly, so the selected top K elements are selected randomly.

With accepted possibility, we can filter the element with weigh larger than \"up threshold\" or smaller than \"down threshold\", only sort the elements with weight between the thresholds.\n\nThis is a very good algorithm, i would add it on my notebook for further improvement, but i don't want to implement it right way. This PR is large enough to me, so i would like to leave all the algorithms optimization in future, and just keep the basic implementations of sample algorithms here, make sure they are simple, easy to understand, work correctly, and they can be used as the performance base line for the further improvement.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/129684685/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/129744713","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/949#issuecomment-129744713","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/949","id":129744713,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyOTc0NDcxMw==","user":{"login":"thvasilo","id":9048995,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNDg5OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9048995?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo","html_url":"https://github.com/thvasilo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-11T07:47:57Z","updated_at":"2015-08-11T07:47:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Agreed,

Two more comments:\n1. It would be good to print the exception in addition to failing the test, because otherwise the tests only fails and gives no indication why. A typical pattern is:\n\n``` java\ntry {\n  // some stuff\n} catch (Exception e) {\n  e.printStackTrace();\n  Assert.fail(e.getMessage());\n}\n```\n\nHere, the test prints nothing when working properly, but prints the error when it fails.\n1. `Assert.fail()` does not work when used in spawned threads. The reason is that JUnit communicates the failure with a special `AssertionFailedException`, which needs to reach the invoking framework. That does not happen if the `fail()` method is called in a spawned thread.\n\nHere is how you can do it. It is a bit clumsy, because you need to forward the exception to the main thread, but it works well:\n\n``` java\nfinal AtomicReference<Throwable> error = new AtomicReference<>();\nThread thread = new Thread(\"server thread\") {\n    @Override\n    public void run() {\n        try {\n            doStuff();\n        }\n        catch (Throwable t) {\n            ref.set(t);\n        }\n    }\n};\nthread.start();\n\n// do some test logic\n\nthread.join();\nif (error.get() != null) {\n    Throwable t = error.get();\n    t.printStackTrace();\n    fail(\"Error in spawned thread: \" +

I wonder if we can fix these with this pull request as well:\n1. The control flow of the `streamFromSocket` function is hard to predict because there are many `while` loops with `break`, `continue`, or `throw` statements.\n2. We could use `StringBuilder` instead of `StringBuffer` in this class. `StringBuilder` is faster in the case of single-threaded access.\n3. The function reads a single character at a time from the socket. It is more efficient to use a buffer and read several characters at once. _Edit: Not a concern, that's what the BufferedReader does._\n\n@HuangWHWHW You asked how you could count the number of retries in a unit test. Typically, you would insert a `Mock` or a `Spy` into your test method. Unfortunately, this does not work here because the socket variables is overwritten in case of a retry. So for this test, I would recommend creating a local `ServerSocket` and let the function connect to this socket. You can then control the failures from your test socket.
