And do you check why you are using another way to build plugin test scenario?\r\n\r\nI use the same way as `gateway-2.1.x-scenario` except the spring cloud gateway version.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/830723157/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/830732731","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/6880#issuecomment-830732731","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/6880","id":830732731,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgzMDczMjczMQ==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-02T03:15:51Z","updated_at":"2021-05-02T03:15:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I merged the other one.

personal views are as follows:\r\n\r\nThe first thing we should determine is the relationship between these Events and Alarms ([it seems that no one discussed with me above](https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/6888#discussion_r624622071)), and the need to find out the list of all events that were already in store when the current Alarm occurred.Or just include the corresponding `Type == Alarm Events` (which may be 1 or 2) generated under the current Alarm.\r\n\r\nIf it is determined in a certain time period with the **Scope (Service/Instance/Endpoint)** related to all events (such as the **Type ==  Start、 Shutdown、 Alarm、 and other, etc.**), it means that there could be multiple event,The amount is unimaginable.\r\n\r\nFirst of all: The richness of so many events is guaranteed, but it is also filled with lists of events that are not too directly related to the current Alarm.\r\n\r\nNext: A list of events that are not too strongly correlated may not be as convenient as the user might expect.\r\n\r\nThen: The first thing we should determine for performance concerns is how to query (through endpoints or not).\r\n\r\n1. The first is to query all the Alarm Messages at once through the drop-down box as now, and then associate multiple Alarm Messages and multiple Events lists in memory.\r\n2. The second option is to query the event list when an Alarm Message is queried and paginate it in the front end.\r\nOnly after you decide on these two query modes can you determine how to operate in the backend OAP Server and guarantee excellent performance.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the above problem is to determine how to establish an accurate and non-redundant relationship between numerous events and the current alarm, but there seems to be no excellent solution at present.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, if we want to ensure Alarms and Events' associated data with value, we may have the simplest and most valuable way of association, which is to associate the current event list of `Type == Alarm`.Of course, there is nothing wrong with correlating all the Event lists that are matched under the current **Scope**.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, this is just my personal idea. There may be some mistakes in understanding. I am looking forward to @wu-sheng @kezhenxu94  reply.

If you take a look at UI, we could query all scopes' alarm messages. So this kind of filter is pointless.\r\n2. We are only querying limited alarms at one time, so, we could definitely query related events after we have the alarm list.\r\n\r\n## Your questions about the relationship and correlation\r\n> The richness of so many events is guaranteed\r\n\r\nFor a specific entity, there is no chance to have too many events. Could you share why you feel this way? My arguing is you are querying all events of a given scope, rather than an entity. Take the above (1).\r\n\r\nAn alarm is according to the metrics, rather than events, so, they are NOT a direct causal relationship. Logically you could be, such as a redeployment brings the codes with a performance issue in the runtime, which reduces the process capability, then increase the latency. But only we know event and alarm binding within a certain time window and take a look at the codes, we know that for sure. This is not about the solution,\r\nThis example shows you, alarm + event is leading users in the right direction to find the issue, we are not doing it internally. So, basically, all events matters, we can't know what is happening. \r\n\r\n___\r\nThe conclusion is, once you have the alarm list with entities(of source scope), you could find their events easily, and as limited queries, there is not a query performance risk.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/831125391/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/831144201","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/6892#issuecomment-831144201","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/6892","id":831144201,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgzMTE0NDIwMQ==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-03T09:36:52Z","updated_at":"2021-05-03T09:36:52Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"If you want helps, you need to provide more information or debug locally.\nPlease learn how to ask questions at open source project.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/831144201/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/831152782","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/6892#issuecomment-831152782","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/6892","id":831152782,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgzMTE1Mjc4Mg==","user":{"login":"impavido-7","id":47530775,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NTMwNzc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47530775?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/impavido-7","html_url":"https://github.com/impavido-7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/impavido-7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/impavido-7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/impavido-7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/impavido-7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/impavido-7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/impavido-7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/impavido-7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/impavido-7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/impavido-7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-03T09:52:33Z","updated_at":"2021-05-03T09:52:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I am really sorry Sir,....To be more precise with the question, I am using skywalking like this\r\n\r\nClientMonitor.register({\r\n    collector: 'http://127.0.0.1:8080',\r\n    service: 'browser-app',\r\n    serviceVersion: '1.0.0',\r\n    pagePath: location.href,\r\n    enableSPA: true,\r\n    useFmp: true\r\n  });\r\n\r\nAnd in the index.js file in skywalking-client-js/lib, I console logged the data like this \r\n\r\nReport.prototype.sendByXhr = function (data) {\r\n  delete data.collector;\r\n  if (!this.url) {\r\n    return;\r\n  }\r\n  console.log(data);\r\n}\r\n\r\nThis data, I am getting the same .....\r\n\r\nHope I provided some information.

Why are you asking me about this? If you are thinking about 2 steps query, why we haven't discussed this at the protocol level.\r\n\r\nSorry, it was only after I received the request to narrow the scope of the query that I looked at the code and found that the current single-step query mode seemed unable to construct the query condition completely(The query criteria only have the **Scope Type**, without the  **Source values**.).\r\nThis is one of the reasons why I brought up the topic of a two-step query. Another reason is that it seems like a bad way to query the Alarm list first and then construct different EventQueryCondition (populating the Source) to query the corresponding Event list (multiple queries).Of course, this way can also achieve a single step query all. \r\n\r\nSo I would like to confirm with you and @kezhenxu94 :\r\n1. The first way： I might need to roll back the query-protocol to the previous version, undo the code that I want to merge this time, and then break it into two steps and let the UI query it.\r\n2. The second way is that I don't need to roll back query-protocol and use a single step to query all of them, but that doesn't seem to be a good way to do it.  \r\n\r\nWe need to choose one of these two ways.

I am so sorry that my mistakes has caused unnecessary works for you and @kezhenxu94 . 😅 if there are some problems in my way of asking questions, thanks for helping me to point out.
