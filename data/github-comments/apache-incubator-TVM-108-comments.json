for bringing up this topic. We might need to consider the scenarios we want to use relay and design under those constraints. For now the main use cases is inference(maybe training in the future). I guess most of the objects allocated during inference will be `TensorObject`, plus a few `DatatypeObject`, we can run some benchmarks for major models to confirm. `TensorObject` shouldn't cause cyclic reference, and if it's the majority of the objects, we can handle them with existing reference counting. And for the remaining `DatatypeObject`, a mark sweep GC can be called infrequently. But **benchmark first**. :-)\r\n\r\nAgree sharing GC. For AOT, should we learn how rust get rid of GC as a further optimization?

PR #3429. Rather than adding `TVM_DLL` to `Bind` in `expr_functor.h`, I think it would be better to remove one of these declarations. However, the two do have different doc strings. It would be great if one of the authors could confirm the desired way of handling it.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the two declarations of `Bind`s can be left as they are for now - (per my investigation) without changes to the pattern util, we need to use Clang to compile for Windows and Clang only throws a warning for this. However, once VC compiler officially supports designated initializer, we still need to fix the declaration for VC compiler to work.\r\n\r\nOne other thing I am not able to understand is that why turning on `std:c++latest` in VS 2019 messes things up. As described before, some packed funcs from `tvm.dll` appear shifted (e.g. calls to `_Array` go to `_raw_ptr`; `n = tvm.var('n'); m = tvm.var('m'); A = tvm.placeholder((m, n), name='A')` should reproduce this). I did not spend much time on this as it seems like a compiler/linker issue. I would appreciate if someone could figure out what is going on.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/505285361/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/505322223","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/3400#issuecomment-505322223","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3400","id":505322223,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNTMyMjIyMw==","user":{"login":"tmoreau89","id":5974488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQ0ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89","html_url":"https://github.com/tmoreau89","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-25T07:26:42Z","updated_at":"2019-06-25T07:26:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you for addressing the comments @huajsj ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/505322223/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/505346957","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/3393#issuecomment-505346957","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3393","id":505346957,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNTM0Njk1Nw==","user":{"login":"srkreddy1238","id":14215163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjE1MTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14215163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238","html_url":"https://github.com/srkreddy1238","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-25T08:39:01Z","updated_at":"2019-06-25T08:39:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @zhiics & @yongwww .
