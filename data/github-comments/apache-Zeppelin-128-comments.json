Leemoonsoo 3 hours ago Member\r\nI think void close(String sessionId) supposed not necessarily terminate process while an interpreter process can have multiple sessions.\r\n\r\nI also agree with @Leemoonsoo's opinion.\r\nThe \"close () method\" should only serve to close the session.\r\n\"Close () method\" To force a process termination call,\r\nIt is very effective in this issue, but it has the potential to become a problem in the future.\r\n(Especially about user management functions or roles for sessions)\r\n\r\n**In my personal opinion, we need to identify this as an increase and a decrease in the erroneous reference.**\r\nIn the past we actually had a separate code to forcefully terminate the \"Remote Interpreter\".\r\n\r\nRef Code (destroy) : https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/branch-0.6/zeppelin-interpreter/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/interpreter/InterpreterGroup.java#L204\r\nremove PR : https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/commit/c6c67d7b112eceb36846e03207cb9c37519f1730\r\n\r\nActually this is very similar to the current code.\r\nActually, this problem is almost solved by recovering to the point of the code of the corresponding PR or adding the content of the problem.\r\nHowever, in my opinion, the essence of this problem is not a \"zombie process\"\r\nI think the **session management is wrong.**\r\nIf you do not know what to do with the destroy () method, you can simply restore it.\r\nBut, in my humble opinion, the deletion of the \"destory () method\" is not the wrong way.\r\nOf course I also need more specific research on this part.\r\n\r\nwhat do you think?\r\n\r\nSorry. @prabhjyotsingh \r\nI think you presented a good solution.\r\nBut I think I have to approach this problem carefully.\r\nPlease tell us your opinion at any time.\r\nThank you.

think we don't need to differentiate Global/Per Note/Per User and/Per User + Impersonate. It should just close current session. And let `RemoteInterpreterProcess` to determinate whether to shut down the process. So that means for Global, there should be only one session, the process will be terminated if restart is invoked. And for `Per user`, it should only close current session, and will terminate the process if there's no session associated with the process (we can even make the process wait there for a while in case new session will be launched soon, but this is a another story). If the behavior is not what we expect, then there must be something wrong with `RemoteInterpreterProcess`. Currently we don't have a very clear and dedicated component for session management, `RemoteInterpreterProcess` and `InterpreterGroup` seems kind of session manager.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/280887834/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/280888650","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2034#issuecomment-280888650","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2034","id":280888650,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MDg4ODY1MA==","user":{"login":"prabhjyotsingh","id":674497,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NDQ5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/674497?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh","html_url":"https://github.com/prabhjyotsingh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-19T01:34:55Z","updated_at":"2017-02-19T01:34:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sure I see your point.

agreed, documentation is one part, but, other part being how should Zeppelin or `RemoteInterpreterProcess` handle connection is more important. \r\n\r\nSo, in the same example as describe above where livy's default mode is `per user`, and here \"admin-grp\" goes and changes some setting say mode from \"yarn-cluster\" to \"yarn-client\" (a hypothetical example) saves setting and restart. Now in current implementation, except for this user others that connected to livy's server before this user \"admin\" are still submitting to \"yarn-cluster\", which to me is wrong; because the source of truth should have been Zeppelin's interpreter setting page, new the users that were connected to this interpreter before this change are behaving different, and new users will behave different.\r\n\r\nSo, IMHO until we have individual interpreter setting for individual user (or we support the scenario described above https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2034#issuecomment-280888650); whenever restart or edit and saved is clicked, all processes should terminate.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think, and any other thought that I might be missing ?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/281006236/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/281028705","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2034#issuecomment-281028705","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2034","id":281028705,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MTAyODcwNQ==","user":{"login":"FireArrow","id":1497322,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTczMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1497322?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FireArrow","html_url":"https://github.com/FireArrow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FireArrow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FireArrow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FireArrow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FireArrow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FireArrow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FireArrow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FireArrow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FireArrow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FireArrow/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-20T09:29:46Z","updated_at":"2017-02-20T09:29:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I think restart from settings in the table above should have the same behavior as edit+save.
