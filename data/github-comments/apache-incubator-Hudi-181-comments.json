I read the documentation for AWS Backup and S3 support.\r\n\r\nBased on the documentation, I am assuming we can do the following (using the us-east-1 issue that occurred on 2021-DEC-7, we want to use latest Hudi tables from us-east-1 in failover region):\r\n\r\nFAILOVER SCENARIO:\r\n1. Create a backup of Hudi Datalake S3 bucket on us-east-1 using AWS Backup and create a copy of that in region X.\r\n2. When us-east-1 failure/issue occurs, then restore Hudi Datalake S3 bucket backup (created from us-east-1) into a different S3 bucket in region X.\r\n\r\nFALLBACK SCENARIO (when us-east-1 is stable again, we want to bring over any Hudi table updates from region X back to primary region us-east-1):\r\n1. Create a backup of Hudi Datalake S3 bucket on region X using AWS Backup and create a copy of that in us-east-1.\r\n2. When ready to fallback to us-east-1, then restore Hudi Datalake S3 bucket backup (created from region X) into a S3 bucket in us-east-1.\r\n\r\nSounds like above scenario should work - won't be able to test this until AWS Backup for S3 is generally available (IN PREVIEW is limited to only us-west-2).\r\n\r\nWe can probably do something similar if we need to failover/fallback between different AWS accounts since AWS Backup supports cross region and cross account.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/993845354/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/993873043","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/3961#issuecomment-993873043","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3961","id":993873043,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM47PUyT","user":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-14T18:43:42Z","updated_at":"2021-12-14T18:43:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"looks like we already have a PR to fix this https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/4016\r\nClosing this out as we have a fix.
