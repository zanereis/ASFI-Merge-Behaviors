> csListMinute，csListHour，csListDay列表分别保存一分钟、一小时、一天的点，分别对应有6、6、24个点，computeStatsData通过调用栈我看用途大多数都是去计算系统中一些统计值，如topic一段时间内的消息量、TPS等统计值。按照原实现，比如我看到的topic的小时级别数据和天级别的数据就具有一定的延迟性，比如小时级别的数据我就需要10分钟后才能精确，天的数据就有1小时延迟。修改代码只是在统计分钟级别的时候去更新了小时和天级别的最后一个值的数据，这样小时级别和天级别还是原设计的6、24个点，只是小时改为统计1h+10min内的实时值，一天改为统计1D + 1h内的实时值。或许这里修改不是最优的实现方式，但是我认为这里确实存在统计延迟\r\n> \r\n> 你是对的,我的问题,没看仔细.有个问题问下,为啥不放在synchronized代码块里面了\r\n\r\n考虑synchronized代码块里面主要是对 对应列表有影响的放在里面，且每个采样方法里面都有对应列表锁，而一小时和一天修改跟一分钟列表无关系，没必要在一分钟的synchronized代码块里面","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/890651759/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/890661745","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/3173#issuecomment-890661745","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/3173","id":890661745,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl841Fmtx","user":{"login":"odbozhou","id":14222167,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjIyMTY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14222167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/odbozhou","html_url":"https://github.com/odbozhou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odbozhou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odbozhou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odbozhou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odbozhou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odbozhou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odbozhou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odbozhou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odbozhou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odbozhou/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-02T02:17:54Z","updated_at":"2021-08-02T02:17:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It
