Couple of quick thoughts.\r\n\r\nGlad you picked up that we decided last week to add the `Release process` label for this.  An earlier addition was `Highlight`.  It's not been used much yet.  Idea was to tag PRs that bring in key new features to highlight in notes, and give @geertjanw something to write about! :smile:\r\n\r\nWe do seem to have a new contributors section already - may be missing what you mean?!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1285529321/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1285543556","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/4826#issuecomment-1285543556","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4826","id":1285543556,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5Mn9aE","user":{"login":"ebarboni","id":6940099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDAwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6940099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni","html_url":"https://github.com/ebarboni","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-20T13:30:16Z","updated_at":"2022-10-20T13:30:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"for me is ok to merge (maybe we could direct commit to adjust the template later)\r\n\r\nrelease drafter ok as it is not used or in create incomplete (no contributor)\r\n \r\nthe \"current release note\" are done manually from tag to tag using github.\r\n\r\ntechnical ? if we rework a release note from tag 13-14 will it be taken or should it be on the release 140 branch ?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1285543556/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1285543588","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/4826#issuecomment-1285543588","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4826","id":1285543588,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5Mn9ak","user":{"login":"mbien","id":114367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien","html_url":"https://github.com/mbien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-20T13:30:17Z","updated_at":"2022-10-20T18:01:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> We do seem to have a new contributors section already - may be missing what you mean?!\r\n\r\n@neilcsmith-net https://github.com/apache/netbeans/releases we used to have one when the defaults were used, until everything was re-generated with release-drafter.

For example most tests extend NbTestCase which can do a lot of NB specific things.\r\n\r\nYou could try to ask on the dev mailing list and see if someone has a good idea how to test things like this. However, UI tests have the tendency to break with time (sometimes randomly) and take long setup time to execute. I can't promise that we would add tests like that since we are reaching some limits. Mocking UI code is also not trivial and often not very useful.\r\n\r\nAs you can see on a full test run\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/netbeans/actions/runs/3280529976/usage\r\n (scroll down for the total time spent), thats a lot of time spent testing.\r\n \r\nBtw since we are talking about testing. I think I found a bug, I am not quite sure how to reproduce it reliably. The popup closes sometimes if a list is closed. It often happens if the first list is closed and possibly if the last list has only one item in it - had no time to investigate further.\r\nAnother thing: I believe it would be better if the popup wouldn't close if a project-name item is clicked without clicking the x just like it was before. There is no action associated with it, so I believe its better if it does nothing on click.\r\n\r\nBut there is no need to hurry to fix this since there is quite some time till the NB17

Its just a map of currently available javadoc links. NB doesn't necessarily have to support the version in question.\r\n\r\nE.g I have a bookmark group in the browser which links to all javadocs between 5 and current/ea so that I can quickly access them if needed.\r\n\r\nWouldn't a  \"Other OpenJDK docs\" submenu be useful too which simply lists everything - no matter what NB version is in use?\r\n\r\n(I get that NB is smart and trying to list only the doc for the opened projects, but sometimes this is a bit too smart if you want to quickly look something up)\r\n\r\nThe Map itself might not be the most elegant way of solving this, but maybe a simple method which does some date math and calculates the link at runtime would do - since its so easy to calculate. But for now I have no memory concerns due to the growing size of the map :P","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1287764691/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1287769077","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/4837#issuecomment-1287769077","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4837","id":1287769077,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5Mwcv1","user":{"login":"neilcsmith-net","id":3975960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3975960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net","html_url":"https://github.com/neilcsmith-net","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-22T11:42:01Z","updated_at":"2022-10-22T11:42:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> NB doesn't necessarily have to support the version in question.\r\n\r\nYes, that was kind of my point.
