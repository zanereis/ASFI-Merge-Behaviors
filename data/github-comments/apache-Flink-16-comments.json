good.\n\nI have one suggestion concerning the Hadoop dependencies: The `flink-java` project depends on the Hadoop API, for the `Writable` interface, the `NullValue` and the InputFormat classes. \n\nWe should be able to exclude all transitive dependencies from the Hadoop dependency in `flink-java`, making the project more lightweight, so that someone that only writes against the flink API does not have the long tail of transitive hadoop dependencies.\n\nWhenever we really execute Hadoop code, we have the flink runtime involved, which then has the necessary dependencies.\n\nTo exclude all
