This is somewhat a limitation of Livy 0.5.0. Livy will not let you find sessions by name until v0.6.0. This version is available, but I don't have it in my environment.\r\n> \r\n> There are two work arounds I've used.\r\n> \r\n> * Use different accounts to run the session controllers.  The code does check to see if the username matches between the session it grabs from Livy and the configuration.\r\n> * Use multiple Livy servers, we used two different name nodes and setup an instance on each.\r\n> \r\n> If you have Livy 0.6.0 you could update the code to work with session names. This would easily work around your issue, each session in a session controller could be named `session-1`, `session-2`, etc...\r\n> \r\n> Note: Livy never updated the documentation when they added this feature ([apache/incubator-livy#48](https://github.com/apache/incubator-livy/pull/48)).

NIFI uses attributes for both data (to augment content) and metadata to control behaviour.  In the JMS example, there is no valid JMS field for “JMS_IBM_Encoding.type” , it is just used to help the processor build the headers so it shouldn’t leak from the processor.  The mime type however is used by downstream applications like a web/email server so they should be passed along. I am new to NIFI though so happy to take advice.\n\nDarren\n\n> On 7 Jul 2020, at 5:23 am, Joey <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n> \n> \n> @jfrazee commented on this pull request.\n> \n> In nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-jms-bundle/nifi-jms-processors/src/main/java/org/apache/nifi/jms/processors/JMSPublisher.java <https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4385#discussion_r450432161>:\n> \n> > @@ -108,6 +108,13 @@ void setMessageHeaderAndProperties(final Session session, final Message message,\n>                          }\n>                      } else {\n>                          // not a special attribute handled above, so send it as a property using the specified property type\n> +                        String key=entry.getKey();\n> +                        if (key.endsWith(\".type\")){\n> If we go broad and apply this to anything ending in '.type' I think it deserves a WARN.\n> \n> —\n> You are receiving this because you were mentioned.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub <https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4385#pullrequestreview-443347444>, or unsubscribe <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AOLUPLLFJR7ULDX764J72EDR2IQC5ANCNFSM4ORGHSFQ>.\n> \n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/654467047/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/654499917","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4377#issuecomment-654499917","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4377","id":654499917,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1NDQ5OTkxNw==","user":{"login":"alopresto","id":798465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODQ2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/798465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto","html_url":"https://github.com/alopresto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-06T22:41:23Z","updated_at":"2020-07-06T22:41:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I believe @mtien-apache has also made some changes around the OIDC provider in [PR 4344](https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4344).

Some NARs still need Jetty itself (some HTTP processors, e.g.) so our JettyServer class and its dependencies are now in a nifi-server NAR, which has the \"nifi-jetty-bundle\" as a parent. \r\nThe naming gets confusing here because NiFi code has a JettyServer class, but the nifi-jetty-bundle just has pure Jetty dependencies for those NARs that need them. For example all NARs with custom UIs (the Advanced button on the component dialog), components that need to start a server (ListenHttp, e.g.) have nifi-jetty-bundle as the top-level parent.\r\n\r\nThis PR also includes refactoring the way the NiFiServer implementation is instantiated. It used to look for a hardcoded class name (for JettyServer) and use reflection to instantiate it. This PR removes that code and replaces it with a ServiceLoader that looks in the NARs for an implementation of NiFiServer. For the normal NiFi assembly, the nifi-server NAR (with JettyServer) will be there so it will get discovered as expected. But for other assemblies (such as MiNiFi Java), the nifi-server NAR would be replaced with a different implementation, and this PR offers one called MiNiFiServer in a minifi-server NAR. If you replace the nifi-server NAR with minifi-server, the UI/REST components are no longer available, and the flow controller and all components are created immediately and the flow is loaded/initialized.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/654986964/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/654989630","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4376#issuecomment-654989630","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4376","id":654989630,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1NDk4OTYzMA==","user":{"login":"ottobackwards","id":1111551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTE1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards","html_url":"https://github.com/ottobackwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-07T16:48:24Z","updated_at":"2020-07-07T16:48:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"\"The @RequiresInstanceClassLoading annotation also provides an optional flag `cloneAncestorResources'.
