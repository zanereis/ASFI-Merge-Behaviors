My main interest is building DolphinScheduler against Hadoop 3, and using commons-lang2 via testcontainers doesn't block it. Given that, we don't have to update LICENSE, NOTICE, and known-dependencies.txt since we still depend on commons-lang2 through testcontainers.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1238770312/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1238775250","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/11210#issuecomment-1238775250","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/11210","id":1238775250,"node_id":"IC_kwDOClTkms5J1jXS","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-07T00:25:18Z","updated_at":"2022-09-07T00:25:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue has been closed because it has not received response for too long time.

On the Workflow Instances page, there is a Workflow with a status of \"Preparing to Stop\" and a Run Type of \"Resume Fault-tolerant Workflow\", but it cannot be deleted. The number of runs is always increasing.\r\n\r\nLater, it can be deleted by modifying the value of the state and recovery of the workflow instance in mysql.\n\n### What you expected to happen\n\nRestoring a fault-tolerant workflow requires a timeout\n\n### How to reproduce\n\nWhile the task is running, restart the dolphinscheduler, then delete the corresponding task definition.\n\n### Anything else\n\n_No response_\n\n### Version\n\n3.0.0\n\n### Are you willing to submit PR?\n\n- [ ] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to
