So dependent on underlying environment of developer executing tests I guess.\r\n\r\nI did some analysis on master over lunch that seemed to have narrowed it down to `CalcitePlannerModuleTest`:\r\n\r\n##PASS\r\n* `mvn -Dtest=<test>` with each of the new test classes from #9279\r\n* `mvn -Dtest=DruidCalciteSchemaModuleTest,CalciteQueryTest test`\r\n* `mvn -Dtest=NamedDruidSchemaTest,CalciteQueryTest test`\r\n* `mvn -Dtest=NamedLookupSchemaTest,CalciteQueryTest test`\r\n* `mvn -Dtest=NamedSystemSchemaTest,CalciteQueryTest test` \r\n##FAIL\r\n* `mvn test`\r\n* `mvn -Dtest=CalcitePlannerModuleTest,CalciteQueryTest test`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/583039832/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/583042865","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/9304#issuecomment-583042865","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/9304","id":583042865,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MzA0Mjg2NQ==","user":{"login":"mohammadjkhan","id":18354068,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzU0MDY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18354068?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohammadjkhan","html_url":"https://github.com/mohammadjkhan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohammadjkhan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohammadjkhan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohammadjkhan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohammadjkhan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohammadjkhan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohammadjkhan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohammadjkhan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohammadjkhan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohammadjkhan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-06T18:24:44Z","updated_at":"2020-02-06T18:24:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"👍 Nice!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/583042865/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/583048861","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/9322#issuecomment-583048861","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/9322","id":583048861,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MzA0ODg2MQ==","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-06T18:38:21Z","updated_at":"2020-02-06T18:38:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @abossert, I believe it is hard-coded by design. The Kafka indexing service is designed to guarantee the exactly-once ingestion which requires Druid to track valid offsets of partitions. If some offsets are expired and automatically reset in Kafka, Druid will find some gaps between the offsets from Kafka and the ones it is aware of, which will lead to an internal error. If you want to reset automatically with the Kafka indexing service, please consider setting `resetOffsetAutomatically` and `useEarliestOffset` properly in the tuningConfig. Also, please note that resetting automatically will lead to DATA LOSS (when `useEarliestOffset = false) or DATA DUPLICATION (when `useEarliestOffset = true).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/583048861/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/583049656","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/9324#issuecomment-583049656","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/9324","id":583049656,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MzA0OTY1Ng==","user":{"login":"suneet-s","id":44787917,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0Nzg3OTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44787917?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/suneet-s","html_url":"https://github.com/suneet-s","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suneet-s/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suneet-s/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suneet-s/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suneet-s/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suneet-s/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suneet-s/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suneet-s/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suneet-s/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suneet-s/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-06T18:40:15Z","updated_at":"2020-02-06T18:40:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@capistrant Thanks for the repro steps.

It makes sense why he did it, since once the Calcite classes get loaded up and read the calcite specific System properties for configuration, they are stuck like that for the life of the JVM. This was an easy solve to make sure that the system properties were correct for the life of the JVM.  It is not obvious to developers to add this unless they reference other tests that touch Calcite that they should extend his base class, which sucks. I'm not sure there is a way to configure Calcite without using System properties and Calcites.java seems to indicate the same in a from the comments in Calcites.setSystemProperties(). \r\n\r\nTravisCI passing despite all of this has me scratching my head.

An existing implementation we have that I am planning to use (for first version of this feature) is EnvironmentVariablePasswordProvider. This will retrieve the password using the supplied environment key provided (the environment key names will be provided in the ingestion spec). We can use this for now since it is already implemented and is use to deal with passing password in other configs. Other ideas I have that can implement the passwordProvider to provide alternative ways of passing passwords are: \r\n1.  We can make the ingestionSpec takes in a file path. The file path will contains the access key and secret key. The file will be on the machine or on cloud (using default cloud credential) \r\n2.  We can make the ingestionSpec takes in an encrypted access key and secret key. The decryption key will be an environment variable that is set beforehand. Customer will have to encrypt the  access key and secret key themself before putting it in the ingestionSpec\r\n(This can be implement later if we find useful and in addition, can be use in other places that requires passing password though config/api/insecure channel. \r\n- Good point. I agree. We can omit the \"override\" prefix. Since these new keys is part of the \"inputSource\", I do not think people will confuse it with other usage of s3 (since it is in the \"inputSource\" section). Anyhow, the \"override\" is not needed.\r\n- That's a good idea. I agree that in the future it might be necessary to support other properties of s3/cloud to make the ingestion more flexible (and since we already support taking in optional credentials, there is no reason architecturally not to support other properties). \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/584411444/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/584432373","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/9057#issuecomment-584432373","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/9057","id":584432373,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NDQzMjM3Mw==","user":{"login":"mini666","id":17606507,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NjA2NTA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17606507?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mini666","html_url":"https://github.com/mini666","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mini666/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mini666/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mini666/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mini666/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mini666/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mini666/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mini666/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mini666/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mini666/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-11T00:58:29Z","updated_at":"2020-02-11T00:58:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hello, I agree with you.\r\nSo I quickly looked at changing to InputSource.\r\nThe bottom line is that changing to an InputSource is very influential.

\r\nSorry for the confusion around passwordProvider. I think we can reuse the existing Password Providers we have for now (no need to implement new ones). We will treat the accessKeyId as one Password Provider and the secretAccessKey as another Password Provider. Similar to how AWSCredentialsConfig (where you define a separate Password Providers for the .accessKey and the .secretKey). \r\nFor example if user decide to use plain text:\r\n```\r\n      \"inputSource\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"s3\",\r\n        \"prefixes\": [\"s3://foo/bar\", \"s3://bar/foo\"],\r\n        \"properties\": {\r\n          \"accessKeyId\": {\r\n              \"type\": \"default\", \r\n              \"password\": \"abcdef\"\r\n           },\r\n          \"secretAccessKey\": {\r\n              \"type\": \"default\", \r\n              \"password\": \"asdasdadsasd\"\r\n           },\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n```\r\nOr they can use Environment variable password provider:\r\n```\r\n      \"inputSource\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"s3\",\r\n        \"prefixes\": [\"s3://foo/bar\", \"s3://bar/foo\"],\r\n        \"properties\": {\r\n          \"accessKeyId\": {\r\n              \"type\": \"environment\", \r\n              \"variable\": \"<ENV.KEY.NAME.CONTAINING.ACCESS.KEY>\"\r\n           },\r\n          \"secretAccessKey\": {\r\n              \"type\": \"environment\", \r\n              \"variable\": \"<ENV.KEY.NAME.CONTAINING.SECRET.ACCESS.KEY>\"\r\n           },\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n```\r\nOr they can have a mix (which will even be more beneficial when we have file path password provider and encrypt password provider):\r\n```\r\n      \"inputSource\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"s3\",\r\n        \"prefixes\": [\"s3://foo/bar\", \"s3://bar/foo\"],\r\n        \"properties\": {\r\n          \"accessKeyId\": {\r\n              \"type\": \"default\", \r\n              \"variable\": \"asdasdasdasd\"\r\n           },\r\n          \"secretAccessKey\": {\r\n              \"type\": \"environment\", \r\n              \"variable\": \"<ENV.KEY.NAME.CONTAINING.SECRET.ACCESS.KEY>\"\r\n           },\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n```\r\nI think it's better to separate out the access key and secret key using separate password provider so user can be more flexible in choosing which password provider they want to use (if any at all) ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/584492229/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/584493035","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/6208#issuecomment-584493035","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6208","id":584493035,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NDQ5MzAzNQ==","user":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-11T06:20:51Z","updated_at":"2020-02-11T06:20:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue has been marked as stale due to 280 days of inactivity.

If so, how does it provide?\r\n- How does it handle transient failures such as task failures?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/585012920/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/585091632","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/8314#issuecomment-585091632","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8314","id":585091632,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NTA5MTYzMg==","user":{"login":"Stephan3555","id":2537072,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzcwNzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2537072?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stephan3555","html_url":"https://github.com/Stephan3555","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stephan3555/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stephan3555/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stephan3555/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stephan3555/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stephan3555/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stephan3555/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stephan3555/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stephan3555/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stephan3555/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-12T08:35:06Z","updated_at":"2020-02-12T08:35:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Running in the same error, ever found out how to solve this?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/585091632/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/585170985","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/6943#issuecomment-585170985","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6943","id":585170985,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NTE3MDk4NQ==","user":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-12T11:54:36Z","updated_at":"2020-02-12T11:54:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This pull request/issue has been closed due to lack of activity.

But, the user-facing configurations would change which I expect to achieve in this proposal. For example, let say we changed `AWSCredentialsConfig` to use the `CredentialsProvider` as below.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class AWSCredentialsConfig\r\n{\r\n  @JsonProperty\r\n  @Deprecated\r\n  private PasswordProvider accessKey = new DefaultPasswordProvider(\"\");\r\n\r\n  @JsonProperty\r\n  @Deprecated\r\n  private PasswordProvider secretKey = new DefaultPasswordProvider(\"\");\r\n\r\n  @JsonProperty\r\n  private CredentialsProvider credentials = new DefaultCredentialsProvider();\r\n...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, the s3 credentials configurations would be changed from `druid.s3.accessKey` and `druid.s3.secretKey` to `druid.s3.credentials.accessKey` and `druid.s3.credentials.secretKey`, respectively.\r\n\r\n`HttpInputSource` is another example on the ingestion spec side.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  @JsonCreator\r\n  public HttpInputSource(\r\n      @JsonProperty(\"uris\") List<URI> uris,\r\n      @JsonProperty(\"httpAuthenticationUsername\") @Deprecated @Nullable String httpAuthenticationUsername,\r\n      @JsonProperty(\"httpAuthenticationPassword\") @Deprecated @Nullable PasswordProvider httpAuthenticationPasswordProvider,\r\n      @JsonProperty(\"httpAuthentication\") @Nullable CredentialsProvider httpAuthentication\r\n  )\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe new `httpAuthentication` will be a JSON object that has two fields of `userName` and `password`. As a result, the ingestion spec would be changed from\r\n\r\n```json\r\n      \"inputSource\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"http\",\r\n        \"uris\": [\"http://example.com/uri1\", \"http://example2.com/uri2\"],\r\n        \"httpAuthenticationUsername\": \"username\",\r\n        \"httpAuthenticationPassword\": {\r\n          \"type\": \"environment\",\r\n          \"variable\": \"MY_PASSWORD_VAR\"\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n```\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n```json\r\n      \"inputSource\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"http\",\r\n        \"uris\": [\"http://example.com/uri1\", \"http://example2.com/uri2\"],\r\n        \"httpAuthentication\": {\r\n          \"type\": \"environment\",\r\n          \"userNameVariable\": \"MY_USER_NAME_VAR\",\r\n          \"passwordVariable\": \"MY_PASSWORD_VAR\"\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/585332595/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/585391740","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/9351#issuecomment-585391740","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/9351","id":585391740,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NTM5MTc0MA==","user":{"login":"a2l007","id":4603202,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MDMyMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4603202?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/a2l007","html_url":"https://github.com/a2l007","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a2l007/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a2l007/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a2l007/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a2l007/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a2l007/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a2l007/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a2l007/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a2l007/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a2l007/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-12T20:01:40Z","updated_at":"2020-02-12T20:01:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jihoonson Thanks for the clarification.

I think these are pretty rare cases and still can be handled by the `CredentialProvider`. For example, we can add a `PlainUsernameAndSecuredPasswordProvider` for people who really don't want to secure the username. Similarly, we can add `PasswordOnlyCredentialsProvider` for the use case where the username is not required.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/586106053/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/586140156","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/8892#issuecomment-586140156","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8892","id":586140156,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NjE0MDE1Ng==","user":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-14T07:51:34Z","updated_at":"2020-02-14T07:51:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This pull request/issue has been closed due to lack of activity.

I don't think the exactly-once ingestion is possible. And how does the proposed indexing service guarantee it?\r\n\r\nWe are proposing a 2 step approach:\r\n\r\n    - Make a naive pubsub indexing service which provides all the guarantees that a regular pubsub consumer would do - that is, at-least once message semantics. This would in in-line with any normal pubsub consumer would work.\r\n\r\n    - Do some basic research into how systems such as dataflow achieve exactly once processing with pubsub. It is clearly possible to achieve this, since dataflow does it with pubsub (although the details of precisely how are not yet clear to us). This will be more of an exploratory work.\r\n\r\n* Description on the overall algorithm including what the supervisor and its tasks do, respectively.\r\n\t- The Supervisor looks pretty similar to the KafkaStreamSupervisor's basic functions - creation and management of tasks\r\n\r\n\t- If more tasks are required to maintain active task count, it submits new tasks.\r\n\r\n\t- A single task would be doing the following basic things:\r\n\r\n\t\t- Connects to a pubsub subscription\r\n\t\t- Pull in a batch from pubsub (relevant tuning parameters should be available in config)\r\n\t\t- Packets are handed off for persistence.\r\n\t\t- On successfully persisting, send back an ACK message to pubsub for the batch.\r\n\r\n* Does the proposed indexing service provide linear scalability? If so, how does it provide?\r\n\r\n\tThe service can keep launching new tasks to process data from subscriptions, as needed. The supervisor can do periodic checks for pubsub metrics, and if the rate of message consumption is falling behind compared to the production rate, it can launch new tasks across the cluster.\r\n\r\n* How does it handle transient failures such as task failures?\r\n\t- If a task fails before a successful ACK has been sent out, it should be reprocessed.\r\n\t- Data successfully persisted, but ACK delivery fails. In this case, we would want to introduce a retry policy.\r\n\t- In case of permanent failure, pubsub would redeliver the message, which is in line with the at-least once guarantee of the indexing service.\r\n\r\n* Exactly Once case: I think it's fair to say we currently don't have an extremely clear understanding of making exactly once work, but we know other systems do claim to provide those guarantees. I'm interested in trying to see if we can achieve the same with Druid, but for that to happen, the foundation as described above needs to be built first, IMHO.\r\n\r\nThere are unanswered questions here that we haven't fleshed out yet. Would be happy to brainstorm. :)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/586257689/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/586348888","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/9351#issuecomment-586348888","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/9351","id":586348888,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NjM0ODg4OA==","user":{"login":"himanshug","id":246308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjMwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug","html_url":"https://github.com/himanshug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-14T15:56:16Z","updated_at":"2020-02-14T15:56:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Hmm, should one CredentialsProvider be able to handle multiple secrets?
