href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=jark\">jark</a>:</i>\n<p>As JStorm has a redesigned Web-UI with clear and clean code. It's totally different from Storm's UI including REST API, so I post here to have an evaluation first before migration. I have listed the core differences between them below.</p>\n\n\n<p><b>Multi-Cluster</b></p>\n<ul class=\"alternate\" type=\"square\">\n\t<li>JStorm: YES</li>\n\t<li>Storm: None</li>\n\t<li>Note:  With the increasing scale of the cluster, the number of clusters is gradually increasing. If we continue to use one cluster on web ui, it is too difficult for maintenance. In addition, for some online applications, it's painful to apply for machines, open ports, public ip/domains, and so on. With multi-cluster mode, it's easy to handle hundreds clusters in one web ui.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p><b>UI Design</b></p>\n<ul class=\"alternate\" type=\"square\">\n\t<li>In my opinion, the JStorm UI is much more pretty and has a better user experience, especially topology graph, 30-minutes metric trend graph and log viewer. And JStorm UI provides abundant metrics which is very helpful for debugging and tuning. However, Storm UI is a bit difficult to use. Please refer to<br/>\n<a href=\"http://storm.taobao.org\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">http://storm.taobao.org</a> to have a look JStorm UI. Any feedbacks about UI are welcome.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><b>UI Deployment</b></p>\n<ul class=\"alternate\" type=\"square\">\n\t<li>JStorm: Do not depend on jstorm environment, just put the ui war into tomcat(or other container), it works !</li>\n\t<li>Storm: Need to install storm on the machine first.</li>\n\t<li>Note: we can evaluate it</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p><b>Web Framework</b></p>\n<ul class=\"alternate\" type=\"square\">\n\t<li>JStorm: Spring MVC</li>\n\t<li>Storm: HTML + REST</li>\n\t<li>Note: SpringMVC is widely used and the development is very convenient. HTML + REST is also ok, but the template code is a little unreadabl now, too much separate templates so that it's hard to find which position is it in the page. If we choose HTML+REST way, maybe we can replace Mustache with <span class=\"error\">&#91;Vue.js&#93;</span>(<a href=\"http://vuejs.org/\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">http://vuejs.org/</a>) which is a MVVM component for building web interfaces with two-way data-binding feature like Angular but much lighter and faster.<br/>\n\t1. Using Vue.js, we can easily implement separating front-end and back-end.<br/>\n\t2. Using Vue.js, there is no need to split template and HTML, we can finish all things in one file with much cleaner and clearer code. It’s in fact much simpler if things are just in the same file. The context switching of jumping back and forth between two files actually makes the development experience much worse. <br/>\n\t3. Vue.js has been used in JStorm UI.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p><b>REST API</b></p>\n<ul class=\"alternate\" type=\"square\">\n\t<li>JStorm: using Spring boot</li>\n\t<li>Storm: plan to use Jersey</li>\n\t<li>Note:  We can choose one based on strengths and weaknesses.</li>\n\t<li>Advantage of Jersey:<br/>\n\t\t1. Jersey implement jax-rs standand. Spring build their own set of Api, did not follow the jax-rs specification. In other words, the REST service developed by Jersey can be transferred to other jax-rs (e.g. RESTEasy) easily. However Spring can not. <br/>\n\t\t2. Jersey framework is more light, the performance of REST application implemented in Jersey is about 2x than Spring's.</li>\n\t<li>Advantage of Spring:<br/>\n\t\t1. Spring boot has been widely used in micro-service and many companies nowadays. <br/>\n\t\t2. Spring can help us develop quickly and conveniently as it has technology like Ioc, AOP.<br/>\n\t\t3. Spring's ecosphere is good, it provides rich libraries , such as Spring Security which is helpful to build UI/REST access control.<br/>\n\t\t4. Spring is very popular, Spring's community is very active. Spring has full documents, much more examples.<br/>\n\t\t5. With better modularization, maintenance costs will be less.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Logview</b></p>\n<ul class=\"alternate\" type=\"square\">\n\t<li>JStorm: return plain log, jstack, directory list</li>\n\t<li>Storm: return HTML which contains logs and buttons.</li>\n\t<li>Note: Storm users need to send an HTTP request to supervisor. In the situation that the network between user and supervisor is disconnected, user can not get the log. This situation is very common. However JStorm's web server will send the request for user to supervisor and return HTML to user, so that user do not need to communicate with supervisor.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>So I suggest to migrate JStorm UI as the Storm 2.0 UI. Although this issue is in phase 2, I think it's fine to evaluate whether to deprecate Storm UI and start it as soon as REST issue is done. In addition, as far as I am concerned, we should replace logview with JStorm's way or static HTML+REST.</p>\n\n<p>BTW, I wrote all jstorm ui code alone, and I have reviewed storm code many times. I'm familar with both. So I hope I can do some contributions for this issue.</p>\n\n<p>Any comments are welcome.</p>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612679208/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612662317","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/5156#issuecomment-2612662317","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/5156","id":2612662317,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI2NjIzMTc=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-27T13:55:34Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T14:28:09Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=johnbaba\">johnbaba</a>:</i>\n<p>In fact Jstorm’s default scheduler is similar to Storm’s.

href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=julianhyde\">julianhyde</a>:</i>\n<p>At a high level, it looks good. But I have some questions about the design and direction.</p>\n\n<p>I have a concern that you are operating on Calcite logical algebra, rather than having created a Storm physical algebra. It shouldn't matter in the short term, but you will probably want to do query optimization in future. In a physical algebra you would have StormFilter extends Filter, etc. I am not referring to deep optimization, but simple rewrites like pushing filters have very large benefits and are almost essential to do SQL efficiently.</p>\n\n<p>Have you published some SQL examples? And an example how to use SQL from Java code?</p>\n\n<p>It seems that you are skipping over the Delta operator. All will be fine for simple Scan-Filter-Project queries, I think this means you will run into problems when you add Aggregate and definitely when you add Join.</p>\n\n<p>SQL support seems under-tested right now. A few areas of exposure are the SQL built-in functions, null semantics, and the combinations of all the various relational operators. Several of Calcite's tests (e.g. SqlOperatorBaseTest) are structured like TCKs and could be incorporated into Storm's test suite to give huge test coverage at little effort. What do you think of co-developing TCKs for streaming SQL semantics?</p>\n\n<p>Is there anything that should be contributed back to Calcite? PostOrderRelNodeVisitor looked like a candidate.</p>\n\n<p>I think <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=wheat9\" class=\"user-hover\" rel=\"wheat9\">Haohui Mai</a> or maybe someone else from the Storm community should join the Calcite dev list and actively participate. Calcite's API has a large surface area and things naturally get broken. For projects that depend heavily on Calcite (which now includes Storm), the best process seems to be for those projects to proactively verify that nothing has been broken before our first RC. Staying up to date allows us to fix bugs you encounter in a timely fashion. (Before you ask: we are a small dev team and don't like the overhead of maintenance branches!)</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612598947/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612680916","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/5186#issuecomment-2612680916","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/5186","id":2612680916,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI2ODA5MTY=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-01T20:56:32Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T14:36:33Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a

Spouts read from the disruptor queue in a non-blocking way, so they can handle the ack/fail messages that are sent to them.  They essentially are polling from two different sources, the user given spout code and the disruptor queue, so the wait strategy is the way to not do it in a busy loop.  Bolts are only reading from a single source, the disruptor queue.  In the common case a bolt is blocking so if a client, like HBase, is getting errors and the bolt thinks it needs to slow down its processing, it can just sleep.  This will cause the input queue to backup and if you have load aware shuffle enabled it will start to try and route tuples around the slow bolt giving them to bolts that are not getting errors.  If all of the bolts are getting errors automatic back-pressure, if it is enabled, will stop the spouts from sending any more messages until the blockage clears up.  There are potentially lots of things we can do to improve on this system, as the current back-pressure is a fairly big hammer, and it would be nice to only stop spouts that can impact the blockage, or simply throttle them so they are going at a better pace.</p>\n\n<p>If you have an asynchronous bolt you can still implement a similar throttling yourself in your bolt code by limiting the maximum number of tuples that can be in flight at any point in time.  None if this really needs to be a part of the system.  If you would like to work on a solution that make it more transparent to bolts and provides system level metrics about throttling that seems OK.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612680923/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/161324640","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/911#issuecomment-161324640","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/911","id":161324640,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MTMyNDY0MA==","user":{"login":"unsleepy22","id":631361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTM2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/unsleepy22","html_url":"https://github.com/unsleepy22","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unsleepy22/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unsleepy22/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unsleepy22/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unsleepy22/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unsleepy22/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unsleepy22/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unsleepy22/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unsleepy22/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unsleepy22/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-02T15:00:32Z","updated_at":"2015-12-02T15:00:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@ashnazg \nsince python 3.x is officially not fully compatible with 2.x, is it necessary to make this change?
