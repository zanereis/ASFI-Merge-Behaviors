The [createTable API ](https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/master/flink-libraries/flink-table/src/main/scala/org/apache/flink/table/catalog/CrudExternalCatalog.scala#L39) in Catalog interface also has a flag to indicate whether ignore the creation if the target table already exist. Though the CrudExternalCatalog will be replaced with a new interface, the createTable API and its signature will remain. Thus the 'replace' flag will actually conflict with the 'ignoreIfExist' flag in catalogs that manage those tables. It will not only complicate the `registerTableXxxInternal` implementation then, but also confuse users.\r\n\r\nThus, I think it's better to either simply remove the flag or change the flag's meaning to 'ignoreIfExist' that keeps up with catalog API.

I think `ignoreIfExists` and `replace` is 2 different requirement which didn't conflict with each other. As I mentioned before, `replace` is very necessary in interactive scenarios (especially in notebook). \r\n\r\n```\r\nIt will not only complicate the registerTableXxxInternal implementation then, but also confuse users\r\n```\r\nThis would a little complicate the registerTableXxxInternal, but I think it is fine because it is internal implementation.  Since it is internal implementation  (registerTableXxxInternal is not public api), I don't think it would confuse users.

you @StefanRRichter for your reply. The items you mentioned are all right and I learn a lot from them. But consider the great performance after my optimization, I think that this will help more persons.  My code is already used in our company's online platform and it is stable for a long time. We just use IntervalJoin to deal our data. \r\n\r\nFollowing your suggestions and for code-simple, I think it's better to add filter(lowerBound, upperBound) rather than entries(lowerBound, upperBound) in MapState in semantics, although their function is the same. Also, we add isIntervalJoinSeekOptimization in config to open the optimization. This optimization is not open to users.\r\n\r\nCurrently, only rocksDB's filter is supported. Because rocksDB's storage is different than others and only rocksDB supports large state . Also, rocksDB supports lowerBound and upperBound interfaces for users to optimize seek. Consider the specific implement for rocksDB, we only open the optimization by config parameter. \r\n\r\n For comparable, we will give a note in the comment to warn developers of key-types. Anyone who wants to use this function must guarantee the comparison for the key. As for my case in the intervalJoinOperator, the key is timestamp and it is comparable in byte-lexicographical.\r\n\r\nFor upperBound, rocksDB does't support setIterateUpperBound in ReadOptions until the rocksdbjni version 5.9.2. Flink rocksdbjni's version is 5.7.5.\r\n\r\nAbove is my thought. The code is modified too.

It looks java operators, hive and pg9.6 behave the same for these cases(first param negative, second param negative etc). So I think aligning with java operators in code gen is reasonable.\r\nFor param type, hive uses the way that if first param is tinyint/smallint/int then return value is int and if first param is bigint(long) then return value is bigint(long).
