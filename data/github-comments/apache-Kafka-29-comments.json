We wanted to be very careful and thoughtful for any new features we added into the framework since we take any of them as big commitment that will carry for a long run. So I want to make sure if the motivation scenarios for any of the new feature requests be common and general enough or if they can be work-around without loosing much programmability.\n\nAs for your use case, just want to clarify first that for Kafka Stream's local state, it will use a specific partition of the changelog topic corresponding to its task id that owns the local state, and its log is compaction-enabled by default which will use the message key as the local state's key to obsolete old values. Hence there is no partitioning concerns for its change log. So for your case (a database transaction log stream as source, with multiple services trying to do stateful processing at different levels), one alternative way is to send the source messages with just the partitioning fields as message keys to the corresponding topics for different services, i.e.:\n\n1) send to topic \"per-database\" with key \"<database>\" and the row as the value.\n2) send to topic \"per-collection\" with key \"<database/collection>\" and the row as the value.\n3) send to topic \"per-group\" with key \"<database/collection/group>\" and the row as the value.\n\nThen for each service's own stateful processors that consume from the above corresponding topic, create their local state with key \"<database>/<collection>/<group>/<row>\" and row as the whole value, then for each instance of the local state, its changelog will be sending to a single partition with the message key as the state key to garbage collect obsolete data with the same key. The general idea is that we keep using only the fields for partitioning in the normal Kafka topic, and use the combo key for garbage collection of changelog in local states which will not be affecting any partitioning schemes. \n\nMoving forward we could think about reducing this unnecessary log duplication just for different partitioning schemes by introducing a general hierarchical key-aware partitioner along with the partition assignor so that we will only need to send to a single topic with the key \"<database/collection/group>\" to O \\* P \\* Q partitions, while the \"per-group\" service can create up to O \\* P \\* Q processors with each getting one partition, and the \"per-collection\" service can create up to O \\* P processors with each get Q partitions that are all from \"<database/collection/*>\".\n\nDoes this make sense? cc @ymatsuda @jkreps \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/160794893/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/160832842","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/309#issuecomment-160832842","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/309","id":160832842,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MDgzMjg0Mg==","user":{"login":"rhauch","id":84732,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NzMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84732?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch","html_url":"https://github.com/rhauch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-01T02:57:58Z","updated_at":"2015-12-01T02:57:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@guozhangwang, I do hope that it is clear that there are valid use cases where Kafka Streams processors do need to explicitly control the partitions to which their messages are sent. And, yes, this is independent of any topics used internally by Kafka Stream state stores, which IMO is very nicely done to ensure proper storage and recovery of the state stores while being almost entirely transparent to any developers creating processors that use state stores.\n\nI tried to keep my description of my use case very simple to avoid small nuances and complexities, but I may have been too abstract to be useful in discussing partitioning alternatives. \n\nBasically, I have a system that involves multiple _services_, where each service consumes one or more topics, performs some logic that may or may not involve local state stores, and writes output messages to one or more other topics. Let's call these services _A_, _B_, _C_, and _D_ (although I actually have about a dozen of them with well over a dozen different topics), and a typical deployment might have 8 instances of service A, 16 instances of service B, 20 of service C, 5 of service D, etc. Previously I was using Samza, and had a separate job for each kind of service. I did not like Samza's dependency on YARN, and wanted more control over deployment. Kafka Streams seemed ideal, so I created a prototype that uses Kafka Streams, where each kind of service is defined by a simple topology with one or more sources, usually a single processor, and one or more sinks, and I can easily deploy these topologies to as many processes as I'd like.\n\nAlthough a minority of my services can easily handle _at least once_ delivery, I've gone to great lengths to ensure that the remainder of my services are able to do _exactly once processing_, despite failures that can occur at any time. Most of this was accomplished with very careful design of the state stored locally and the processing logic. As I'm sure you're aware, this logic is more complex when a single processor writes out to more than one topic: any failure of the processor while having written to at least one but not all of the output topics makes it likely that downstream processors (that consume this service's output streams) will see duplicate messages. Since that cannot be prevented entirely, the downstream processors have to be able to detect duplicate messages.\n\nSo since writing to multiple output topics greatly complicates a processor's logic for exactly once processing, using multiple topics as a means of controlling partitioning would only exacerbate this complexity, and I would deem it a non-starter for my system.\n\nYou also suggest using what I call an \"artificial key\" that is solely used for implicit partitioning via the global/default partitioner. I've done exactly that in several of my topics, especially in those that contain _events_ rather than _entities_, since they are not candidates for log compaction and thus the key no longer becomes terribly important for consumers.\n\nIn cases where the messages do represent _entities_, log compaction is a very important approach to minimize the size of the persisted logs. However, these topics cannot be replaced wholesale by the topics written by the state stores, since they cannot be replayed by downstream consumers. Additionally, the upstream processors shouldn't have to dump all their state to the stream -- that complicates the processor and the whole system, introduces potentially very significant latency, and unnecessarily duplicates persisted data.\n\nI think I've very clearly shown that some Kafka Stream use cases do indeed need to explicitly specify the partitions to which messages are sent, and in these cases how the topics are partitioned becomes an integral part of the system design. I think I've also explained how the global/default partitioner is not very straightforward or efficient for these cases, since any custom global partitioner would have to deal with the specific topics at hand plus delegate to the standard partitioner for all other topics (like those from the stateful stores, offset commits, or any others used by Kafka itself). I hopefully have explained how using \"artificial keys\" solely for partitioning is great in some situations, but is insufficient in others. Using multiple streams for different partitioning schemes has too much overhead and adds too much complexity to some processors that require exactly once delivery/processing.\n\nAll of the issues I've discussed in this PR are easily solved by simply allowing a Kafka Stream topology to explicitly direct messages to specific partitions. So while I completely agree on the importance of keeping the Kafka Streams API as simple and stable as possible, IMO it is a mistake to prevent custom partitioning logic. The proposed PR is a minor change to the public API so that a topology can optionally define a custom partitioner on each sink. It's not mandatory, so all the use cases that don't need to worry about partitioning (other than configuring the number of partitions) don't have to use it. But those use cases that require it have a very simple and straightforward mechanism. \n\nHopefully you agree that the Kafka Streams API does need to enable custom partitioning within a topology. Perhaps you don't agree with how this PR does it, in which case we can certainly look at alternative changes.
