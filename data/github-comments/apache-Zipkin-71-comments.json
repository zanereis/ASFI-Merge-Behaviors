It's just that I tried integrating Zipkin into our own architecture and thought sending spans asynchronously through RabbitMQ is a wonderful feature. When I now run zipkin-server-2.8.4-exec.jar, bind it to an elasticsearch- & rabbitmq-service and add the `spring-cloud-starter-zipkin` dependency to an existing Boot 2.0 app, I would assume it to work out-of-the-box (with sleuth.sampler.probability: 1.0) because the consumer's (Zipkin) framework (based on SB 1.5) shouldn't affect the producer's (based on SB 2.0) and vice-versa because of RabbitMQ as a decoupling-layer. Unfortunately this isn't the case as I don't even see a queue getting created in RabbitMQ-mgmt-ui as I would assume Zipkin would do during startup in order to listen to it and consume incoming messages. So before wasting your time investigating in a different issue, I wanted to clarify whether this use-case is intended to work and if so, what to configure. From a developer's perspective, sending spans asynchronously makes more sense than using a synchronous HTTP interface.

User experience is mostly a dev issue when developing\ncustomizations.\n\n\nFor these scenarios logging or Exception metrics callbacks (normal ones)\ncan help. You can look at the existing unit tests for the collector where\nlogging is verified. We did a lot on collector logging and the fact that\nthere is a new place in lifecycle, adjustment, minimally hints at logging\nneeded here. For example after decoding and before storage, we can have a\ndebug message about any adjustment error.\n\nMeanwhile adjustment errors are bugs. Please keep this in mind that\nadjusters should absolutely never throw. In other words please dont try to\nuse exception as flow control logic.\n\nIf all things above said, the error message in http needs to be customised,\nI would suggest a hook for this, specific to the http collector, probably a\ncallback. However we need to ensure this happens synchronously as otherwise\nyou cant report an error anyway. This might be a challenge as I don't\nrecall where in the lifecycle of http collector we release a 202. If we\nwant a nice message back to what is the requestor, usually an async lib,\nthis needs to be kept in mind.\n\n\nall above basically hints lets keep abstractions clean, not use error as\nflow control, which means exceptions in adjusters are bugs, and finally\nmake the least api for collectors possible.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/396790742/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/396792500","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/2072#issuecomment-396792500","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2072","id":396792500,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5Njc5MjUwMA==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-13T02:21:06Z","updated_at":"2018-06-13T02:21:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"from a metrics mapping pov, recall we have spans dropped metrics. if\nadjuster blew up, or it decided to drop, this should be incremented. in a\nway this impacts the api. for example if the adjuster is a function of one\nspan (which might be appropriate considering no trace id grouping is\nlikely), returning null should increment span drop as should any unexpected\nerror. it should be logged to fine as well.\n\nthis isn't to say we cant add more hooks but bear in mind monitoring is\nvery simple now.. it is messages and spans accepted or dropped. we dont\nhave any splitting hairs about why from metrics pov.\n\nnow consider a site wants to be very specific. they could make a micrometer\ndecorator which adds metrics on unexpected exception classified by type\netc. for example finagle does similar by showing a hierarchy of exception\ntypes.
