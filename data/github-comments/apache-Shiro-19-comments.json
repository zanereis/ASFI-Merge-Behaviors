That did indeed work.  I completely agree with the idea that using the users in the ini file is by no means a production solution but I disagree a bit with not publicizing that you should quote the strings because (as I linked in the original) it is mentioned/shown at least twice in the existing docs with the new format as an example, but it absolutely will not work as shown.  So I think it makes sense to either remove the examples or update them to show the quotes because otherwise users are just getting confused.

The fix for the jakarta version just renames it to `jakarta.annotation.security;version=\"[1.3,2)\"`.\r\n\r\nHowever, Jakarta never released a 1.3.x bundle containing jakarta.* package - they only released a transition bundle containing javax.* packages. The first version of jakarta.annotations-api containing a jakarta.* package is 2.0.0. \r\n\r\nSo we need to change the version, not only the imports.

It seems that the RMI functionality has been removed (I noticed that the content is relatively simple and could potentially be manually added back in to temporarily resolve this issue). Additionally, the compatibility of Spring-Boot3 with Spring-Boot2 doesn't seem to be ideal, especially for parts that rely on the Spring5 framework. My current approach is to create a version of Shiro for Spring-Boot3 and replace the internal javax dependencies with jakarta dependencies (Spring-Boot2 uses javax, while in Spring-Boot3, it has been changed to Jakarta). This might solve the issue. I'm still trying and not sure if it will work, but adding a version specifically for Spring-Boot3 would be more user-friendly for those developing with Spring-Boot3 (so they don't have to manually exclude javax dependencies one by one). I believe that creating an additional version to support Spring-Boot3 is simpler than trying to make the existing shiro-spring-boot support both Spring-Boot2 and 3.(Translated by GPT4o)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/comments/2121822763/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/comments/2123438791","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues/1236#issuecomment-2123438791","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/1236","id":2123438791,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAARy8s5-kRrH","user":{"login":"lprimak","id":1002484,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDI0ODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1002484?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak","html_url":"https://github.com/lprimak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-21T21:03:24Z","updated_at":"2024-05-21T21:03:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Shiro uses `maven-shade-plugin` to produce artifacts with `jakarta` classifier that solve compatibility with Spring 6.\r\nSee https://github.com/apache/shiro/tree/main/samples/spring-boot-3-web for an example.\r\nThe warnings specified in this issue has nothing to do with Boot 2 vs 3 or Framework 5 vs. 6 compatibility as that problem is already solved there.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/comments/2123438791/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/comments/2123736863","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues/1236#issuecomment-2123736863","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/1236","id":2123736863,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAARy8s5-lacf","user":{"login":"SilenceLurker","id":78900386,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4OTAwMzg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/78900386?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilenceLurker","html_url":"https://github.com/SilenceLurker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilenceLurker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilenceLurker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilenceLurker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilenceLurker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilenceLurker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilenceLurker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilenceLurker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilenceLurker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SilenceLurker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-22T02:04:09Z","updated_at":"2024-05-22T02:04:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"It seems that I initially found a tutorial that wasn't very good, which involved manually removing javax related dependencies one by one when importing dependencies.

am not sure if this is the issue, but I noticed that ShiroFilterFactoryBean implements both FactoryBean and BeanPostProcessor interfaces. This could be the cause. However, I have not tried separating them into two classes, each implementing one of the interfaces. In terms of the Spring lifecycle, the order seems to be FactoryBean -> Bean -> BeanPostProcessor. Implementing both might cause issues. The FactoryBean documentation suggests that the implementation class should not be used as a normal bean (\"NB: A bean that implements this interface cannot be used as a normal bean. A FactoryBean is defined in a bean style, but the object exposed for bean references (getObject()) is always the object that it creates.\"). This suggests that users should not manually create beans for its implementing class.\r\n\r\nWhile debugging in the Spring-Boot 2 environment, I noticed similar issues in the call stack, but Spring-Boot 2 seems less strict in its checks compared to Spring-Boot 3, hence no warnings. However, customizing a ShiroFilterFactoryBean or AuthorizationAttributeSourceAdvisor may still trigger these warnings in Spring-Boot 2 (with the former being more severe).(Translated by GPT4o)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/comments/2126697751/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/comments/2127166589","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues/1493#issuecomment-2127166589","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/1493","id":2127166589,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAARy8s5-yfx9","user":{"login":"zhuxindong","id":24989246,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTg5MjQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24989246?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuxindong","html_url":"https://github.com/zhuxindong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuxindong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuxindong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuxindong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuxindong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuxindong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuxindong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuxindong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuxindong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuxindong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-23T13:49:42Z","updated_at":"2024-05-23T13:49:42Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Yeah, i know the rememberMe function is disabled by default.
