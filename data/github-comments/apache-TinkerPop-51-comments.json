It is troubling that it is not any particular test that is a problem, but seems somewhat random and entirely bound to Travis executions (I don't seem to be able to get the failures to occur locally). Aside from this change and an additional modification i made to preserve error messages that we had before, I can't think of anything else that would be causing the problem. As such, I'm starting my investigation here, but reverting these changes in a branch to see if Travis stabilizes. If I find that the branch is stable then I imagine I will need to permanently revert the changes in the release branch until it can be determined exactly what introduced this problem. I would expect to re-open the JIRA.\r\n\r\nI will continue updates here.

I also added that code to prevent error, but that may be best handled by dealing with the connection drop.  I will try to prove this by removing this if statement and seeing if my workaround prevents this as well.

think revert is a good first step here. Depending upon how the dev list thread goes we can figure out if new JIRA issues are required. Aside from a CHANGELOG entry this looks good to me. \r\n\r\n@olivertowers if you have a moment to test this branch with CosmosDB to validate that all is good, that would be hugely helpful. if it would be helpful to have a fresh SNAPSHOT published with this change I can do that ..just let me know.  cc/ @luisbosquez\r\n\r\nVOTE +1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/550296873/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/551035997","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1188#issuecomment-551035997","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1188","id":551035997,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MTAzNTk5Nw==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-07T11:15:13Z","updated_at":"2019-11-07T11:15:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"i have a quick update in thinking on this one - currently we have a working build on linux and at least one windows environment where there is a problem.  somewhere in all the discussion on this i've pointed out that we don't really support a windows build so if the windows build is working it is a convenience mostly.

- this is starting to look really concise. nice to see all the tests passing with your changes. that provides some nice confidence. i have a few thoughts at this point:\r\n\r\n* Please add some CHANGELOG entries for the changes you've put in place.\r\n* I think this is an important enough change that it requires some upgrade documentation to help summarize for users what they can expect as a result of these changes - you would add them [here](https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/tp34/docs/src/upgrade/release-3.4.x.asciidoc).\r\n* I assume there are no breaking changes in existing behavior here (aside from behavior that was previously undesired) - please correct me if I'm wrong.\r\n\r\nIf you're really busy, I can probably add those changes on merge, but those doc fixes would
