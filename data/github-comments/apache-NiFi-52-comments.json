Our focus is only on properties that require user to enter password. All sensitive properties need not be a password property. And password properties are supposed to be single line and should not support expression-language. (Also i believe password boxes cannot be created without `<input type=\"password\">`)\r\n\r\nAlso understand the impact that you mentioned - \r\n\r\n> There exists sensitive properties that currently expect the field to support multi-line input. The input[type=password] only supports a single line.\r\n\r\nI am willing to contribute..

Thanks for the updated commit. I confirmed that my comments are incorporated.\r\n\r\nIt works as expected in most cases, however, I found a case which needs to be addressed.\r\n\r\nLet's say I have a table with a primary key like this:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\ncreate table tutorials_tbl(\r\n   tutorial_id INT NOT NULL,\r\n   tutorial_title VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,\r\n   tutorial_author VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL,\r\n   submission_date DATE,\r\n   PRIMARY KEY ( tutorial_id )\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd insert some rows, then update a row, especially update its primary key:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nupdate tutorials_tbl set tutorial_id = 110 where tutorial_id = 11;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAbove update query generates following JSON via CaptureChangeMySQL:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{ \"type\" : \"update\",\r\n  \"timestamp\" : 1492648209000,\r\n  \"binlog_filename\" : \"mysql-server-bin.000004\",\r\n  \"binlog_position\" : 97152,\r\n  \"database\" : \"nifi_test\",\r\n  \"table_name\" : \"tutorials_tbl\",\r\n  \"table_id\" : 222,\r\n  \"columns\" : [ {\r\n    \"id\" : 1,    \"name\" : \"tutorial_id\",    \"column_type\" : 4,    \"last_value\" : 11,    \"value\" : 110\r\n  }, {\r\n    \"id\" : 2,    \"name\" : \"tutorial_title\",    \"column_type\" : 12,    \"last_value\" : \"11th\",    \"value\" : \"11th\"\r\n  }, {\r\n    \"id\" : 3,    \"name\" : \"tutorial_author\",    \"column_type\" : 12,    \"last_value\" : \"koji\",    \"value\" : \"koji\"\r\n  }, {\r\n    \"id\" : 4,    \"name\" : \"submission_date\",    \"column_type\" : 91,    \"last_value\" : null,    \"value\" : null\r\n  } ]}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`Transform to Flat JSON` (JoltTransform) flattens the event JSON as below. At this point, the record image before update is dropped:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n[ {  \"tutorial_id\" : 110,  \"tutorial_title\" : \"11th\",  \"tutorial_author\" : \"koji\",  \"submission_date\" : null } ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, PutDatabaseRecord generates an update sql statement with `where tutorial_id = 110`. But it doesn't update anything, because it should have used `where tutorial_id = 11` with before update row image.\r\n\r\nWe might be able to handle this by generating two delete and insert records in a NiFi flow, or do something smart at PutDatabaseRecord.\r\nHow do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/295517475/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/295534626","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1677#issuecomment-295534626","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1677","id":295534626,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NTUzNDYyNg==","user":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-20T01:38:00Z","updated_at":"2017-04-20T01:38:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hmm, would this be a problem with Update Keys in general, or only Primary Keys when Update Keys are not specified?
