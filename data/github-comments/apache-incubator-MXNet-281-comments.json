an implementation point of view, it's hard to enable such mono-dimensional array. \r\n\r\nThe 1-D shape could be passed directly to the backend, whereas all the sparse operators in the backend  assumes `shape[0]` is num_rows and `shape[1]` is num_cols at the moment. Accepting 1-D shape for csr would require **significant efforts** to check these cases for each operator in the backend. `zeros` is not the only operator affected, cases include:\r\n- `mx.sym.var('a', shape=10, stype='csr')`\r\n- generate a random uniform csr ndarray with 1-D shape \r\n- dot with 1-D csr\r\n- convert a dense 1-D array to csr\r\n- etc..\r\n\r\nI suggest that we throw an exception for 1-D shape for `sparse.zeros` to guide users the expected usage instead. \r\n\r\n ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/350393045/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/350393232","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/8849#issuecomment-350393232","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/8849","id":350393232,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MDM5MzIzMg==","user":{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-08T22:58:27Z","updated_at":"2017-12-08T22:58:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"`zeros` will not be the only function which require changes if we enable such feature.

We don't want a PR to remove features.\r\n\r\nGoogle test for batch norm is going to be difficult because now batchnorm and batchnorm_v1 are using different interfaces. To enable this test, I guess that the only option is to refactor batchnorm_v1 as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/350410800/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/350414149","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/8949#issuecomment-350414149","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/8949","id":350414149,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MDQxNDE0OQ==","user":{"login":"taliesinb","id":365157,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NTE1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/365157?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/taliesinb","html_url":"https://github.com/taliesinb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taliesinb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taliesinb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taliesinb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taliesinb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taliesinb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taliesinb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taliesinb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taliesinb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taliesinb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-09T01:43:06Z","updated_at":"2017-12-09T01:43:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@piiswrong what name makes more sense to you than `split_layer`? perhaps `unflatten_layer`, because it is doing the opposite of flattening the first two dimensions? I am happy with any name, what is important to me is that it prevents the need for multiple unrollings, which is incredibly expensive. basically, i don't see how a high level framework that wants to efficiently implement variable-length sequences can live without this operation.\r\n\r\ni have an alternative to creating a new layer, which is adding more numeric codes to the Reshape layer, basically -10, -11, -12, etc which means \"take the dims from an optional second reference shape input\". unfortunately having an optional second input in Reshape seemed to be impossible due to technical issues i didn't fully understand to do with gradients having the wrong shape. also, it seemed like a complicated feature that was only going to be used for this splitting purpose. i now regret those previous codes we added to Reshape layer, because i have only ever used them for splitting and merging the first two dimensions, i think it would be much more understandable to have `flatten_dims` and `unflatten_dims` that are only for this purpose.
