keep in mind that Flink's current SSL support doesn't achieve _mutual authentication_ - there's no client certificate there.    Even with SSL enabled, an untrusted client can launch jobs in your Flink cluster and thus gain access to the Kerberos credential associated with the cluster.\r\n\r\nSSL mutual authentication is a good alternative to a shared secret, but at the time we were limited to built-in Akka functionality (which doesn't include mutual auth).   Given the \"flakka\" fork that's now in place, a pure SSL solution might now be possible (I haven't thought it through completely).\r\n\r\nThe fact remains that, today, _all the secrets known to a Flink job are exposed to everyone who can connect to the cluster's endpoint_.  \r\n\r\nIt would be nice to construct a holistic plan that worked out how the Web UI would support authentication and also incorporated FLIP-6.      Both YARN and Mesos interpose a web proxy for the UI with its own limitations, notably no support for SSL mutual auth.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/286530655/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/286536766","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3523#issuecomment-286536766","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3523","id":286536766,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NjUzNjc2Ng==","user":{"login":"gyfora","id":5880972,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODA5NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5880972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora","html_url":"https://github.com/gyfora","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-14T19:40:34Z","updated_at":"2017-03-14T19:40:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hm, doesnt seem to work for the first try.
