Unfortunately the documentation hasn't been updated to reflect the change in the API though, and I only realised after making the PR that the documentation is outdated and my PR redundant.\n\nThe change is (mentioned [here](https://libcloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/changelog.html#changes-with-apache-libcloud-0-14-0-beta3)) is:\n\n> Deprecate the following EC2 provider constants: EC2_US_EAST, EC2_EU, EC2_EU_WEST, EC2_AP_SOUTHEAST, EC2_AP_NORTHEAST, EC2_US_WEST_OREGON, EC2_SA_EAST, EC2_SA_EAST and replace it with a new EC2 constant. Driver referenced by this new constant now takes a “region” argument which dictates to which region to connect.\n\nSo the following example (lifted from the docs):\n\n```\ncls = get_driver(Provider.EC2_US_WEST)\ndriver = cls('temporary access key', 'temporary secret key', token='temporary session token')\n```\n\nbecomes:\n\n```\ncls = get_driver(Provider.EC2)\ndriver = cls(\"auth key\", \"auth secret\", token=\"token\", region=\"us-west-1\")\n```\n\nSo the driver type is no longer used to determine the location which the driver connects to. Instead, if you specify a valid region, that is the region it connects to. Valid regions are: \n- eu-west-1\n- sa-east-1\n- ap-southeast-2\n- us-west-1\n- us-east-1\n- ap-southeast-1\n- ap-northeast-1\n- us-gov-west-1\n- eu-central-1\n- us-west-2\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/148729592/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/148737889","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/545#issuecomment-148737889","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/545","id":148737889,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0ODczNzg4OQ==","user":{"login":"JamesGuthrie","id":1117749,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTc3NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1117749?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesGuthrie","html_url":"https://github.com/JamesGuthrie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesGuthrie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesGuthrie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesGuthrie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesGuthrie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesGuthrie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesGuthrie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesGuthrie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesGuthrie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesGuthrie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-16T14:51:53Z","updated_at":"2015-10-16T14:51:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've opened #606 to fix the docs.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/148737889/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/148741216","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/545#issuecomment-148741216","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/545","id":148741216,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0ODc0MTIxNg==","user":{"login":"ralphbean","id":331338,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTMzOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/331338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralphbean","html_url":"https://github.com/ralphbean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralphbean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralphbean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralphbean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralphbean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralphbean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralphbean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralphbean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralphbean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralphbean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-16T15:05:34Z","updated_at":"2015-10-16T15:05:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks @JamesGuthrie.

@davidwilson2038, thanks for this!\n\nAlthough I don't know of any actual differences off the top of my head, GCE's pricing _can_ vary by region.  We also have a pricing calculator that can be used to get the most current price list.\n\nRegarding format of the pricing file, this varies a bit from what is proposed in #464?  I likely need to just get this updated and merged.

Also, one other thing...I jumped the gun on my previous comments...just realized the other drivers use the name of the driver + region name for the name on the pricing json if they have different prices for regions. (e.g. ec2_ap_northeast). Having the region nested in the json as you have currently should break the _get_size_price method when called for list_sizes in the driver. To get this to work, we need to change the list_sizes method and have each region be its own entry in the json file (ie google_asia or google_europe, etc.)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/151189927/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/151775732","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/616#issuecomment-151775732","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/616","id":151775732,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MTc3NTczMg==","user":{"login":"wido","id":326786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/326786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido","html_url":"https://github.com/wido","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-28T09:14:55Z","updated_at":"2015-10-28T09:14:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The
