See e. g. https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/master/components/camel-debezium-mysql/pom.xml. The important part to note here is the dependency scope (\"provided\") which means they don't include the dependency in the final build artifact. As far as I know the closest equivalent in Gradle should be compileOnly. That means that at least from the IDE perspective this issue should be solved (e. g. IntelliJ doesn't make a distinction between these scopes). Not sure if that applies also for running unit tests on the console, would need to test. It will not be included in the release package or Docker images (automatically). The current Dockerfile does download mysql-connector-j from Maven Central with a wget command and the jar file is then included to the Fineract startup with \"java -cp\"...

Just let me know how you and @ptuomola decide... and I'll change it accordingly. I can see your point here with the non-recurring includes; in general I find those modular gradle files useful.\r\n2.  Currently the root wrapper is disabled with the content in settings.gradle. You can't have 2 wrappers (actually project roots), and as I understood you the goal with that first PR was not to change anything for existing setups... because if we change this - and I would really like to do that - then everyone needs to re-import their Gradle project in their IDEs. If that is OK with everyone I'd be happy to do it.\r\n3.  See my answer in 2.\r\n4.  There's no particular reason for -all, just a habit of mine, because with that you get also Gradle's sources for your IDE. Don't need it that often, but sometimes for debugging when something is messed up with the Gradle build. Overall you are right, the community probably won't need it.\r\n5.  Sure, I can move just the wrapper.\r\n6.  Done. Approved and merged. Will rebase this branch.\r\n7.  See my answer in 2. I just wanted to start moving things to the root folder while still maintaining the same setup for everyone else. I just thought you would find it too invasive otherwise. So again, if everyone is OK re-importing their project from root then I'll happily do that change.\r\n\r\nConcerning squashing: no problem, will do.\r\n\r\nConcerning Maven Central: trivial, will appear with the next rounds of cleanups.\r\n\r\nConcerning Gradle Plugin Portal: official repo for all Gradle plugins; can't really say that some might not be available in Maven Central; but could be. Until we really have resolution errors we can remove.\r\n\r\n@vorburger Could you just confirm that those breaking changes are OK before I edit? And please let me know if you want to see the wrapper move to root in a separate PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/706539080/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/706553102","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/1383#issuecomment-706553102","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/1383","id":706553102,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwNjU1MzEwMg==","user":{"login":"vorburger","id":298598,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODU5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/298598?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger","html_url":"https://github.com/vorburger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-10T13:57:34Z","updated_at":"2020-10-10T13:57:34Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Self merged based on 1 LGTM, this change is trivial enough that I don't think we need several LGTM.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/706553102/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/706555171","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/1381#issuecomment-706555171","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/1381","id":706555171,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwNjU1NTE3MQ==","user":{"login":"vorburger","id":298598,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODU5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/298598?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger","html_url":"https://github.com/vorburger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-10T14:12:36Z","updated_at":"2020-10-10T14:12:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@vidakovic thanks for letting me follow along the changes slowly and step by step! Sorry if this is a pain, and I'm learning more about what makes most sense in which order based on review feedback. So, to me personally, forcing people to re-import into an IDE is actually a non-issue, as long as we do everything in steps that everyone can easily understand. IMHO expecting re-import is totally fine; we can always send a line about it to the dev list if required, but I don't even think it really is.. you git pull, it's red, you git log, you figure it out. We can let others chime in on PR review dedicated to JUST that small change for that as well. So what would be the smallest possible incremental next step here then? Do you want to raise a separate new PR with JUST git mv the wrapper out of the fineract-provider into root, and whatever other minimal adjustments that requires, but only what's strictly required? (E.g. don't change bin to dev, yet; could be separate after.) I'm guessing that move, alone, wouldn't give us Spotless coverage for root files just yet, which is fine, we can get back to that in this PR, after.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/706555171/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/706557099","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/1381#issuecomment-706557099","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/1381","id":706557099,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwNjU1NzA5OQ==","user":{"login":"vidakovic","id":380079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MDA3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/380079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic","html_url":"https://github.com/vidakovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-10T14:23:47Z","updated_at":"2020-10-10T14:23:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@vorburger No problem, learning too 😉.

If I'm following along correctly here, you have created [a `release-1.4.0` branch](https://github.com/apache/fineract/compare/release-1.4.0), presumably from [the 1.4.0 tag](https://github.com/apache/fineract/commits/1.4.0), and then in ffed594 _Merge branch 'develop' into release-1.4.0_ (don't we want to do the opposite?), and now this PR wants to merge 16 commits from that `release-1.4.0` branch back into `develop` - which is a NOOP, with no diff.\r\n\r\nThe way I understood what you were after in FINERACT-1154 would be more something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit checkout develop\r\ngit checkout -b FINERACT-1154_merge-1.4.0\r\ngit merge -s recursive -Xignore-all-space 1.4.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis showed me 3 conflicts, which were relatively trivial to resolve; the result is https://github.com/apache/fineract/compare/develop...vorburger:FINERACT-1154_merge-1.4.0?expand=1. It's very similar to this - except for the last merge commit... your _Merge branch 'develop' into release-1.4.0_ has parents ee99f30 + e985597, whereas my _Merge tag '1.4.0' into develop (FINERACT-1154)_ has parents 3ee46b0 + ee99f30 - the \"other way around\" (and a later point on develop). Which is right/better? I'm honestly :smile_cat: asking, as I'm not 100% sure what we are after here.

What I would do now in such a situation, if I were you, is to already start to `git rebase` your #1381 on this, and then the latest develop. That way, you can proceed at least locally. You could even also already push it to GitHub. GitHub is, unfortunately, a bit too stupid to understand that a PR is continuation of another one (FYI Gerrit does this MUCH better), but it still unblocks you, and reviewers can look at the N+ separate new commits after the \"base\" commits from another PR on a new PR;  and it means that once this PR is merged, even if there are still some small changes requested by another reviewer, your still ahead and will have an easier time to re-rebase other work that depends on this.

And _Squash and merge_, while available (green) and \"possible\", as far as I understand things actually wouldn't do at all what you/we are after here - I think that would create 1 \"empty\" commit, without the merge commit that's really what this is all about (`git describe`) - pointless. So TL;DR, yeah, click _Merge pull request_ which _Create a merge commit_. My hope here is that GitHub is somehow smart enough to see that this PR ALREADY ends with a Merge Commit (the 09e08fdc71e86d0133ebf0c27f829d07738208af), and doesn't add ANOTHER one. If it does, then IMHO that's a bit \"ugly\" - but not the end of the world either.

When I pulled in the latest changes from upstream I had to solve one conflict. During rebase I ran then multiple times into various conflict situations and didn't really entirely understand why. But the Spotless configuration is now moved to the root build.gradle and will work for any module that is added (not only for fineract-provider). I've removed also everything that's unnecessary in fineract-provider (mostly Spotless related). @vorburger as you can see the changes are inline and not externalized with \"apply from\" etc.\r\n\r\nI just don't know why the CI build is failing again.
