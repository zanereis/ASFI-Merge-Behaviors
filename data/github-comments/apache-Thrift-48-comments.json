many tests (each time waiting for CI execution is too long, which is equivalent to a basketball game), this problem has been determined to be a cross-language SSL communication test between a Java

The cause has been found out.\r\nThe Erlang community released OTP-23 in May this year. This version has major changes that damage compatibility. SSL3.0 is abandoned and TLS1.3+TLS1.2 is used by default. However, the Java server uses TLS1.2 by default and does not support TLS1.3. Therefore, the Travis-CI integration test has not been working properly since the end of May. \r\nFor now, I think a feasible solution is available. \r\n1. By default, Travis-CI uses the latest Erlang version for integration tests. It may be set to OTP-22. After all, the Erlang version 22 is also specified on the readme. \r\n2. Upgrade JDK8 to JDK11. TLS1.3 is supported by default. \r\n3. The TLS1.3 protocol can also be supported on JDK8. That's what I've been working on.
