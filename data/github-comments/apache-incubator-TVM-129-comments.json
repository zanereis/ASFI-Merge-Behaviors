\r\nThe current loop partition aims to remove conditions based on the bounds returned from the `DeduceBound`. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/1d00c083cbd77b8523d4952d624f1fab5de13056/src/pass/loop_partition.cc#L568\r\n\r\n\r\nHence, it is implicitly making the assumption that bounds are strict. \r\n\r\nE.g in the example you posted above: \r\n\r\n```\r\nfor (i, 0, 4) {\r\n    if (i < 3) body\r\n} \r\n```\r\nBased on the bounds for the `i < 3` it makes three loops `pre_stmt`,  `mid_stmt` and `post_stmt`. \r\n\r\n`mid_stmt` is the loop where it is assuming (or has proven) that conditions are definitely either true or false. \r\n\r\nso, it directly replaces that condition with either `bool (1) or (0)`. \r\n\r\noutput from first iteration would look like: \r\n\r\n```\r\nfor (i, 0, 0) { // pre_stmt i.e. dead loop removed later by the `RemoveNoOp` pass\r\n    if (i < 3) body\r\n} \r\nfor (i, 0, 2) { // mid_stmt here it requires/assumes  that bounds are tights and then replaces the condition\r\n    if ((uint1(1)) body\r\n} \r\nfor (i, 2, 4) { //post_stmt \r\n    if (i < 3) body \r\n} \r\n```\r\n`pre_stmt` and `post_stmt` are further recursed in order to remove the conditions. \r\n\r\nI think it is better to tighten the bounds from the `deduce_bound` itself.  `deduce_bound` is already taking into account rounding up error for the `GE` op here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/1d00c083cbd77b8523d4952d624f1fab5de13056/src/arithmetic/bound_deducer.cc#L160\r\n\r\nHowever, it doesn't do so for the `LE` op. \r\n\r\nSo far from my experience and From the LoopPartition perspective (the one and only user of the deduce_bound I guess),  I haven't seen an example where deduce bound succeeded and produced relaxed bounds except for the particular case of the rounding up for the `LE`.  \r\n\r\nI think it is more or less safe to assume that bounds are always tight except the case mentioned in this issue.\r\n\r\n@xqdan also share your thoughts.

I havent checked the performance of this agains fp32 model we are interested in. I will report the numbers soon. But we do get a lot of speed up on skylake with avx512 and assuming we dont get anything from AVX2 instructions itself due to latency issues you mention, there should still be some perf left from the memory bw persepctive.\r\n\r\nOk. This might be useful to do some paper calculations to see if we can get performance theoretically - https://www.agner.org/optimize/instruction_tables.pdf\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/533733370/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/533746399","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/3983#issuecomment-533746399","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3983","id":533746399,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMzc0NjM5OQ==","user":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-20T23:50:28Z","updated_at":"2019-09-20T23:50:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@soiferj if you change the default behavior of schedule_extern in topi/python/topi/generic/extern.py, you should update topi/include/topi/generic/extern.h too.\r\n\r\n I would rather move your implementation of schedule_extern in x86/extern.h to generic/extern.h, and use it from both python and x86 cpp.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/533746399/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/533746730","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/3983#issuecomment-533746730","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3983","id":533746730,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMzc0NjczMA==","user":{"login":"soiferj","id":3534847,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MzQ4NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3534847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/soiferj","html_url":"https://github.com/soiferj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soiferj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soiferj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soiferj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soiferj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soiferj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soiferj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soiferj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soiferj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soiferj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-20T23:52:53Z","updated_at":"2019-09-21T00:11:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sure, I can work on that.

In fact, the schedules are already registered as generic functions in C++ [here](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/88cd1b1c545797eab8cb0ec32f10fc17cfef9142/topi/src/topi.cc#L714).
