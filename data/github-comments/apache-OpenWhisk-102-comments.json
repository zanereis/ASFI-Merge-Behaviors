I am not yet familiar enough with the ansible set up, but I do know that nginx is configured to only listen for https requests. \r\n\r\nIf I want to write a test to verify that ```Client.Config.BackendURL.Scheme```  is set to http, how can I do so without having to redeploy things?\r\n\r\nHere is another, better question now that I have spent some time looking at this. Should insecure requests ever be supported?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/340571329/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/340619810","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/2802#issuecomment-340619810","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/2802","id":340619810,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MDYxOTgxMA==","user":{"login":"bwmcadams","id":98358,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MzU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98358?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwmcadams","html_url":"https://github.com/bwmcadams","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwmcadams/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwmcadams/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwmcadams/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwmcadams/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwmcadams/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwmcadams/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwmcadams/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwmcadams/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwmcadams/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-30T23:58:50Z","updated_at":"2017-10-30T23:58:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks

Could you motivate why splitting the incoming workload into multiple streams before it hits the load balancing layer is needed?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/341148367/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/341180573","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/2921#issuecomment-341180573","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/2921","id":341180573,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MTE4MDU3Mw==","user":{"login":"dubee","id":11520887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIwODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11520887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee","html_url":"https://github.com/dubee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-01T17:36:15Z","updated_at":"2017-11-01T17:36:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@abaruni, @drcariel, @jessealva ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/341180573/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/341181463","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/2912#issuecomment-341181463","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/2912","id":341181463,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MTE4MTQ2Mw==","user":{"login":"dubee","id":11520887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIwODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11520887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee","html_url":"https://github.com/dubee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-01T17:39:16Z","updated_at":"2017-11-01T17:39:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@jessealva, @drcariel ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/341181463/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/341182248","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/2921#issuecomment-341182248","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/2921","id":341182248,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MTE4MjI0OA==","user":{"login":"dubee","id":11520887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIwODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11520887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee","html_url":"https://github.com/dubee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-01T17:41:56Z","updated_at":"2017-11-01T17:41:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I think we can use the echo test action that already exists as the trigger feed.

dgrove,\r\n\r\nKafka-topics are for  \"payload/message categories\" and Invokers are Architectural entity instances,\r\nSo  making the categories/topics to directly(1-1) map to Invoker-Ids is inflexible, Architecturally, I think. \r\n\r\nAs we know the Invokers can keep coming and going down and when an Invoker goes down the remaining messages in the partition should be automatically picked up by an Invoker with the same capabilities (eg. runtime, size of payloadetc.) ,  because an Invoker subscribes to a specific topic, based on its capabilities, so I think a topic should be tied to \"capabilities - e.g runtime\" than an Invoker-Id.\r\n\r\nI'm expecting the latency may be more or less same, as the load-balancing is done by automatic subscription and the number of partitions  in Kafka. But there should be a  clear Kakfa Message Producer &   Kafka Message Consumer\", and the \"Controller\" & \"LoadBalancer\" can be Producer & Consume respectively.\r\n\r\nAlso of the 3 models for Kafka mentioned  @ https://kafka.apache.org/intro probably, in openwhisk context,  it is a  a bit of \"storage -system\" for the messages, until they are addressed/consumed\" , along with being a Messaging system (for other topics like Health and Invoker Registration) \r\n\r\nThis is my thinking -  please correct/add as you see fit. \r\n\r\nThank you, \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/341299806/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/341333967","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/2913#issuecomment-341333967","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/2913","id":341333967,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MTMzMzk2Nw==","user":{"login":"markusthoemmes","id":1289147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODkxNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1289147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes","html_url":"https://github.com/markusthoemmes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-02T06:59:34Z","updated_at":"2017-11-02T06:59:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"There is quite a bit of history of the loadbalancer. There is one specific issue which prevents OpenWhisk to be auto-loadbalanced by Kafka's partitioning: locality.\r\n\r\nOur loadbalancer has a very strong locality constraint. We need to make use of warm containers as much as possible to keep performance numbers anywhere acceptable. Balancing via consumer groups won't give us that locality necessarily. Do you know how if it's possible to implement that constraint on consumer groups?\r\n\r\n@tysonnorris proposed a change to our topic design which is being implemented on the dev list. You might want to look that up for some more context.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/341333967/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/341343463","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/2913#issuecomment-341343463","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/2913","id":341343463,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MTM0MzQ2Mw==","user":{"login":"ServoKvd","id":10113782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTEzNzgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10113782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ServoKvd","html_url":"https://github.com/ServoKvd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ServoKvd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ServoKvd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ServoKvd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ServoKvd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ServoKvd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ServoKvd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ServoKvd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ServoKvd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ServoKvd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-02T07:55:31Z","updated_at":"2017-11-03T02:15:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi Markus,\r\nthank you for the info.
