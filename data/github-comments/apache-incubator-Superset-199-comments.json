I took a closer look at this and have a few suggestions.\r\n\r\nInstead of applying the overrides at individual control panel file (, which will be moved into plugins).

Additionally at Airbnb we're in the process of migrating away from the Druid REST API in favor of Druid SQL and hence would like to remedy this problem prior to the migration (to ensure consistency). \r\n\r\nNote @mistercrunch I feel that the suggestion you provided still doesn't completely alleviate the problem as it doesn't address the fact that we're mixing dates with timestamps and using lexicographical ordering which means that for SQLAlchemy datasources the time period is a mix of (1) and (4) depending on the underlying temporal data types. Additionally I wonder if introducing a mechanism for having the option to use either `<` or `<=` will add more confusion. \r\n\r\nThis may be a bitter pill to swallow, but given the complexity of the problem (unknown user intent, column datatypes, etc.) the only possible feasible solution may be to make a (somewhat severe) breaking change in an upcoming release which: \r\n\r\n1. Updates the SQLAlchemy model to use `<` rather than `<=`. \r\n2. Updates the database engine specs to use timestamps for temporal fields. \r\n3. Provides a banner on every chart informing users of the change (which can only be dismissed by an owner).\r\n4. Update the release notes which clearly informs individuals of the breaking change. \r\n\r\nNote it would then be up to each institution to send out a PSA to their users informing them of the breaking change and inform chart owners how to modify their charts if necessary.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/468847716/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/468857262","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/6956#issuecomment-468857262","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/6956","id":468857262,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2ODg1NzI2Mg==","user":{"login":"michellethomas","id":817955,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNzk1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/817955?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas","html_url":"https://github.com/michellethomas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-02T00:17:31Z","updated_at":"2019-03-02T00:17:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I
