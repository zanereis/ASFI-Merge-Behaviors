For that to work, we need to integrate it into our public facing APIs.\n\nFor example when the user wants to use an `IFileInfo` object in our APIs, they will simply do:\n`IFileInfo info = DefaultFileInfo.FromFileInfo(new FileInfo(...));`\n\nFor our testing, because we don't actually want to use a `FileInfo` object, we can use NSubstitute in the following way:\n\n```\nIFileInfo infoForTesting = Substitute.For<IFileInfo>();\ninfoForTesting.DirectoryName.Returns(\"FakeDirectoryName\");\n```\n\nSuch that when we test one of our functions with the parameter of an `IFileInfo` with the fake `infoForTesting` object, it will not perform actual actions on a file.
