So calling `receiveAsync` infinitely without any limit while no messages could be received will make pending receives in memory growing infinitely.\r\n\r\nHowever, you can add the limit for the number of pending receives from a client side:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n#include <pulsar/Client.h>\r\n#include <mutex>\r\n#include <condition_variable>\r\n\r\nusing namespace pulsar;\r\n\r\nstruct PendingReceiveTracker {\r\n    std::mutex mutex_;\r\n    std::condition_variable cond_;\r\n\r\n    size_t numPendingReceives_ = 0;\r\n    const size_t maxNumPendingReceives_;\r\n\r\n    PendingReceiveTracker(size_t maxNumPendingReceives) : maxNumPendingReceives_(maxNumPendingReceives) {}\r\n\r\n    void beforeReceiveAsync() {\r\n        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(mutex_);\r\n        while (numPendingReceives_ >= maxNumPendingReceives_) {\r\n            // TODO: you can add other handler instead of wait here\r\n            cond_.wait(lock);\r\n        }\r\n        numPendingReceives_++;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    void completeReceiveAsync() {\r\n        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(mutex_);\r\n        if (numPendingReceives_ == 0) {\r\n            return;\r\n        }\r\n        numPendingReceives_--;\r\n        cond_.notify_all();\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n\r\nint main() {\r\n    Client client(\"pulsar://localhost:6650\");\r\n    Consumer consumer;\r\n    client.subscribe(\"my-topic\", \"consumer-1\", consumer);  // ignore the returned value check here\r\n\r\n    PendingReceiveTracker tracker(1000);\r\n    for (int i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {\r\n        // When the number of pending receives reaches 1000, this method blocks here until any message is received.\r\n        // You can also change the strategy, see the TODO in beforeReceiveAsync()\r\n        tracker.beforeReceiveAsync();\r\n        consumer.receiveAsync([&tracker](Result result, const Message& msg) {\r\n            tracker.completeReceiveAsync();\r\n            if (result == ResultOk) {\r\n                // TODO: process `msg`\r\n            } else {\r\n                // TODO: handle error\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n        // do other things here...\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    client.close();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs for a timeout limit, it's a little more complicated that a timer is needed.\r\n\r\nLet's go back to the timeout case. Send timeout means some specific messages' associated responses are not received during the timeout. Users can choose to reproduce **the same messages** again if they don't care message duplication.\r\n\r\nHowever, unlike the send timeout, receive timeout is not related to any message. So when you encounter the timeout with N pending receives, what will you do? Clear these pending receives? OK, then you'll add more pending receives again.  Clear and then re-add the pending receives is not much different with make these receives continue pending. The only behavior that make much difference is stop receiving, like triggering an alarm.\r\n\r\nA simpler way is just calling `receive()` with a timeout. IMO, `receiveAsync()` doesn't has any more significant benefit than `receive(Message& msg, int timeout)` except waiting for multiple messages at the same time. C++ client doesn't provide something like Java's `CompletableFuture`, so you need to play tricks with the callback.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/739970491/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/739987242","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/8846#issuecomment-739987242","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/8846","id":739987242,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczOTk4NzI0Mg==","user":{"login":"BewareMyPower","id":18204803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MjA0ODAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18204803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower","html_url":"https://github.com/BewareMyPower","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-07T15:24:46Z","updated_at":"2020-12-07T15:25:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think the issue is similar to #8300 .

Add a pending receive when `receiveAsync` is called.\r\n2. Remove a pending receive when an incoming messages is received by `ClientConnection`, while the callback of `receiveAsync` is called.\r\n3.

The only case to use `receiveAsync` is to wait multiple messages.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Java client, when you choose `receiveAsync`, the logic will still be complicated.\r\n\r\nLet's start with a simple client code:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n        try (PulsarClient client = PulsarClient.builder().serviceUrl(\"pulsar://localhost:6650\").build()) {\r\n            Consumer<byte[]> consumer = client.newConsumer()\r\n                    .topic(\"my-topic\")\r\n                    .subscriptionName(\"my-sub\")\r\n                    .subscribe();\r\n            for (int i = 0; i < 100000/* just to represent a large number */; i++) {\r\n                consumer.receiveAsync().whenComplete((msg, e) -> {\r\n                    if (e == null) {\r\n                        // TODO: process `msg`\r\n                    } else {\r\n                        // TODO: handle error\r\n                    }\r\n                });\r\n            }\r\n        } catch (PulsarClientException e) {\r\n            e.printStackTrace();\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe issue is the same. If there're no messages, the pending receives queue will grow infinitely until OOM.\r\n\r\nThen you need to manage these futures, e.g.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n            ArrayBlockingQueue<CompletableFuture<Message<byte[]>>> queue = new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(1000);\r\n            for (int i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {\r\n                CompletableFuture<Message<byte[]>> future = consumer.receiveAsync();\r\n                queue.put(future); // it blocks when the queue is full\r\n                future.whenComplete((msg, e) -> {\r\n                    if (e == null) {\r\n                        // TODO: process `msg`\r\n                    } else {\r\n                        // TODO: handle error\r\n                    }\r\n                    queue.poll(); // just to release a space\r\n                });\r\n            }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo it's like the first C++ example. The code looks more simple just because `ArrayBlockingQueue` has already encapsulated the conditional variable. Also,\r\n\r\nAs for the second C++ example, instead of using `queue.put(future)`:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n                if (!queue.offer(future)) {\r\n                    // TODO: handle the queue is full error to make sure the next queue.add won't fail\r\n                    queue.add(future);\r\n                }\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can just wait for a while, or after #8326 , you can call `cancel` here to remove all pending receives:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n                if (!queue.offer(future)) {\r\n                    queue.forEach(futureInQueue -> futureInQueue.cancel(true));\r\n                    queue.add(future);\r\n                }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe code looks more simple but it's just because Java standard library is more strong. You still have to handle the corner cases from a client side instead of relying on the library.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/740629832/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/740707443","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/8854#issuecomment-740707443","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/8854","id":740707443,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0MDcwNzQ0Mw==","user":{"login":"eolivelli","id":9469110,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0NjkxMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9469110?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli","html_url":"https://github.com/eolivelli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-08T15:56:12Z","updated_at":"2020-12-08T15:56:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"There
