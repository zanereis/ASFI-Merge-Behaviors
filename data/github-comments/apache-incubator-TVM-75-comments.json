This is really nice work. IMHO, the value of this auto diff feature lies in providing a generic way of generating gradient expression for operators, so that developers can avoid tedious implementation of gradient expression. To achieve reasonable performance in BP, we can attach schedules at operator level.\r\n\r\nTwo more questions:\r\n1. How is race condition handled in BP in this PR? For example, `topi.take` uses a input indices tensor to get elements from the input data. When there are duplicate indices provided, there is a race condition at the time of back-propagating output gradient to the same location of the input gradient tensor. How is this problem resolved in this PR?\r\n\r\n2. I have tried `differentiate` on several operators in `topi`. Most of them can return correct results, but there are a few errors. The following is one of them. Any idea where went wrong?\r\n```python\r\nimport tvm\r\nimport topi\r\n\r\nm, n = 40, 50\r\ndata = tvm.placeholder((m, n), name='data')\r\nindices = tvm.placeholder((1,), dtype='int32', name='indices')\r\nret = topi.take(data, indices)\r\nhead = topi.full_like(ret, 2.0)\r\ndiff_ret = tvm.differentiate(ret, [data], head)\r\n\r\n# error message:\r\n# Process finished with exit code 139

SIGSEGV)\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/458356593/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/458371502","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2503#issuecomment-458371502","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2503","id":458371502,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1ODM3MTUwMg==","user":{"login":"icemelon","id":2696494,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTY0OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2696494?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon","html_url":"https://github.com/icemelon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-29T01:31:58Z","updated_at":"2019-01-29T01:31:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@tqchen

How is race condition handled in BP in this PR? For example, `topi.take` uses a input indices tensor to get elements from the input data. When there are duplicate indices provided, there is a race condition at the time of back-propagating output gradient to the same location of the input gradient tensor. \r\n\r\nThis implementation of autodiff doesn't create race conditions in the first place, instead it generates huge naive loops directly. For example, in the case of `take` it will check every single index for every single element of the output:\r\n```\r\n  for (ax0, 0, 40) {\r\n    for (ax1, 0, 50) {\r\n      grad[((ax0*50) + ax1)] = 0.000000f\r\n      for (k0, 0, 10) {\r\n        if (((ax0 == ((indices[k0]/50) % 40)) && (ax1 == (indices[k0] % 50)))) {\r\n          grad[((((indices[k0]/50) % 40)*50) + (indices[k0] % 50))] = grad[((((indices[k0]/50) % 40)*50) + (indices[k0] % 50))] + head[k0]\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nThat is, `take` may be an example when this differentiation algorithm is not a good choice. (Upd: I think, it is possible to rearrange the loops so that `k0` become the outer variable, and then eliminate the variables `ax0` and `ax0` by merging the corresponding loops with the condition. However it seems that this cannot be expressed on the tensor expression level and should be done during or after the scheduling phase.)\r\n\r\n> 2. I have tried `differentiate` on several operators in `topi`. Most of them can return correct results, but there are a few errors. The following is one of them. Any idea where went wrong?\r\n\r\nThank you for reporting, I'll upload the fix soon.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/458458534/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/458574842","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/2522#issuecomment-458574842","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2522","id":458574842,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1ODU3NDg0Mg==","user":{"login":"leeexyz","id":7345156,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNDUxNTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7345156?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leeexyz","html_url":"https://github.com/leeexyz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leeexyz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leeexyz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leeexyz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leeexyz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leeexyz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leeexyz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leeexyz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leeexyz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leeexyz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-29T15:08:44Z","updated_at":"2019-01-29T15:08:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi, it is a sub-repository under`tvm/3rdparty/rang`. you should clone it. please check [rang](https://github.com/agauniyal/rang/)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/458574842/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/458579486","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/2522#issuecomment-458579486","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2522","id":458579486,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1ODU3OTQ4Ng==","user":{"login":"zzzzzzch","id":22396913,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzk2OTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22396913?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzch","html_url":"https://github.com/zzzzzzch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-29T15:20:23Z","updated_at":"2019-01-29T15:20:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"It solves!

I will extract the high-level idea of your comment and say that the development of any Rust functionality will be independent of the main project. Although I jokingly suggested that the reason to rewrite in Rust is because of the language alone, doing so would have the benefits of easier extensibility/prototyping and bringing any re-implemented functionality to new platforms like riscv. For instance, imagine having an in-browser editor for TVM modules backed by a Wasm compiler enabled by Rust; or a F1 instance running a riscv soft core with VTA. As @Ravenwater mentioned, many of us (myself included) are trying to do science. Having more options _as long as it's not a distraction to the core project_ can only help that goal.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/458802162/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/458816467","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/2518#issuecomment-458816467","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2518","id":458816467,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1ODgxNjQ2Nw==","user":{"login":"zhiics","id":5145158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDUxNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5145158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics","html_url":"https://github.com/zhiics","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-30T05:25:27Z","updated_at":"2019-01-30T05:25:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"It looks these two ops are also training related: https://www.tensorflow.org/api_guides/python/threading_and_queues\r\nIt is probably safe to map them to _undef.\r\n\r\n@srkreddy1238 Could you please take a look and confirm?

I think the answer is yes.  Let me elaborate that a bit. The TVM project is a layered system: we have runtime, frontend and compiler core. So we should really ask what does it mean to introduce rust in each setting.\r\n\r\n## Rust Runtime Backend\r\n\r\nRuntime backend means implementing the C APIs in ```include/tvm/runtime/c_runtime_api.h```. TVM runtime is the standalone thing that allows us to implement all the runtime features, in this case, the answer is definitely yes. The main reason is rust have good WASM support as @nhynes mentioned and probably better SGX support. Having a rust runtime gives us good options in these settings. Also because the runtime is minimum, having a rust alternative version helps us to build good support for WASM and SGX. \r\n\r\nThanks to @nhynes , we already have good rust runtime backend support, and I think it makes sense to think about supporting graph to some extent to get good WASM support(without libc).\r\n\r\n## Rust Frontend Support\r\n\r\nFrontend means wrap  C APIs in ```include/tvm/runtime/c_runtime_api.h``` to provide a rust abstraction.  It allow us to deploy models using rust. I think it also makes sense, and @ehsanmok has been working on that.\r\n\r\n## Compiler Core and Node System\r\n\r\nSo the most interesting questions come when we want to think about Rust for compiler cores. In particular,  we should ask where should the AST(i.e. TVM's Node class) live. Nodes are important not only because they are in C++, but also because we have clean API to expose them to python. While I have no doubt it is possible to re-implement the Node system in rust, it makes C++ obsolete, because you cannot directly visit these memory object directly as struct pointer access in C++, so it is not a realistic option.\r\n\r\nA more realistic, but still a challenging question, is whether can we enable writing passes in rust, and plug them in as PackedFunc to the C++ core. I have some serious thoughts in that direction. The simplest way is to use frontend API, like python. However, that is only good for prototyping purposes, because we need to do C API calls just like python did. \r\n\r\n### A Common Node System\r\n\r\nWhat we really want in our case, is to make rust access the C++ AST as backend language, so the Node field access can be done natively via struct address accessing, without getting into C API. Because some folks in the community expressed interest in Rust, I gave some serious thought into this.\r\n\r\nI think it can done, but also technically challenging. The general idea is to make use of C ABI. That is, we build most of the Node system as C objects, which then allows us to expose them directly to Rust. The primary AST and core are still in C++, but the rust language module can directly access these in-memory AST fields via pointer de-referencing. The key challenges here, however, is how can we solve the problem of virtual functions tables, since they are part of C++ ABI and not visible in Rust. For the base Node system, that is partially achievable by defining our own version of vtable struct. In that way, we might be able to expose some of the Nodes partially to rust. I have not tried it out, but it could be an interesting step as long as it does not change the current c++ code base.\r\n\r\n## Summary of My Take\r\n\r\n- We should support rust runtime/frontend, and get most of the benefit @nhynes mentioned(riscv, wasm). \r\n- We should not rewrite codebase in rust, but we could try to explore possible directions to enable rust module plugin alongside with the current c++ core.\r\n\r\nMost of the current @nhynes 's proposal makes sense since they fall into support rust runtime, perhaps we should change the title to Enable rust support instead of rewriting :)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/458821056/reactions","total_count":9,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/458827930","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/2450#issuecomment-458827930","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2450","id":458827930,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1ODgyNzkzMA==","user":{"login":"chinakook","id":5417628,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MTc2Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5417628?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chinakook","html_url":"https://github.com/chinakook","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chinakook/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chinakook/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chinakook/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chinakook/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chinakook/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chinakook/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chinakook/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chinakook/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chinakook/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-30T06:28:16Z","updated_at":"2019-01-30T06:28:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/windows-nnvm-module-export-library-error/1506/3","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/458827930/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/458830320","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/2521#issuecomment-458830320","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2521","id":458830320,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1ODgzMDMyMA==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-30T06:40:46Z","updated_at":"2019-01-30T06:40:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for pointing it out.

So fundamentally you would learn very little from modifying the simulator as functionality is not why you would create a local memory, you would do that for performance, and thus you would need to model the temporal dimension of managing the local memory resource. \r\n\r\nHowever, this request does demonstrate that the simulation back-end of VTA needs a lot of TLC before it becomes usable as a

tool.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/459141825/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/459165815","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/2523#issuecomment-459165815","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2523","id":459165815,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1OTE2NTgxNQ==","user":{"login":"ajtulloch","id":1121581,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjE1ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1121581?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajtulloch","html_url":"https://github.com/ajtulloch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajtulloch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajtulloch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajtulloch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajtulloch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajtulloch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajtulloch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajtulloch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajtulloch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajtulloch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-31T00:25:52Z","updated_at":"2019-02-01T18:43:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I

Memory management. \r\n\r\n2. Kernel support.\r\n\r\nMemory management will determine  whether a program is able to run or not, then may determine efficiency of the runtime. However Kernel support only determines efficiency.\r\n\r\nIf you agree with this, we can future decompose what blocks us: memory management. \r\n\r\nThere are two ways to handle dynamic memory: static allocation and create many views on static memory, or do it in dynamic, where we can call it AOT or JIT. Ideally, if we have a very powerful allocator, two ways are equivalent.  \r\n\r\nIn this RFC we are going to use AOT approach. \r\nTo know how much memory we need to allocate for each storage pool node, we also have two approaches: 1. Give a hint, then get a number 2. Pre compute expression of each pool node size. To quickly get it work this PR is using a ```max_bytes``` hint to get a fixed size, then create view. Note if we can get expression of storage node, JIT allocator will be much easier too.\r\n\r\nAt this point, we already have solutions to deal with memory management. Let's come back to efficiency problem: kernels. \r\n\r\n0. Assume we are doing tensorization + vectorization + loop partition, we will have a good default kernel (most of human code today is written in this way). \r\n\r\n1. Assume for each work load, we have different kernel. If during compile we can have a map between the compiled function, we can handle it during create views. (see ```view_cache_```)\r\n\r\n----------------------------This is a separation line------------------------\r\n\r\nEnd to end changes:\r\n\r\nPython API:\r\n```\r\nb1 = tvm.var(\"n1\")\r\nb2 =
