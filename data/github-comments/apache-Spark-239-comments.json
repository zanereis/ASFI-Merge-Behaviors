I just mean two different operators or methods of some kind. Why bother with these issues instead of making two methods?\n\nYes, choosing 1.0 as the switching point removes the discontinuity. I think it will surprise readers to find that, in a test with a series of checks like \"0.1 +- 0.01\", \"1 +- 0.01\", \"3 +- 0.01\" that the latter doesn't mean [2.99,3.01], when the first two do in fact mean [0.09,0.11] and [0.99,1.01], which matches what one would expect from all these other unit testing frameworks.\n\n@dbtsai I think developing two operators is a good solution If there is a separate operator for relative error, you don't need to special-case the behavior. Sure it's meaningless to make a relative error test at 0 but you can just warn the caller; it's well-defined what happens. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49853321/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49853965","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1403#issuecomment-49853965","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1403","id":49853965,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5ODUzOTY1","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-23T09:53:20Z","updated_at":"2014-07-23T09:53:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA tests have started for PR 1403.

reason for maxNumExecutorsFailure isn't because yarn can't give it more, its because something has happened to enough of your executors that you think there is a problem with the application.  One silly example of this is you start an application and ask for 8G of memory but are only using jdk32.  All executors will fail to launch since asking for more memory then jdk32 can handle. \n\nThere are always possible errors that can occur and executors will just be restarted. Like disk failures, machines go down, etc.  But if you keep having executors fail for other reasons then there is likely a problem with Spark or the application

I don't think that's the goal here; the executor is already dead, so this is not targeted at freeing up executor memory through a very indirect way. This is targeted at cleanup: looking at the posted logs (also see SPARK-2491, although that's just the logs that are also posted here), there are exceptions that would be caused by code holding files open when the VM shuts down.\n\nI stand by my earlier comment that relying on the gc for this is hacky: the code that is making these references unreachable should be cleaning them up. BTW, this also means that, in my opinion, ContextCleaner.scala is similarly hacky, and should be replaced with code that does the right thing without relying on the gc. (Also, because ContextCleaner can be disabled through a conf option...) Regardless of whether one JVM implementation consistently triggers the gc when you call `System.gc()`, others might not, and that still doesn't mean everything that we'd like to be collected actually is.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49901334/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49902317","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1511#issuecomment-49902317","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1511","id":49902317,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5OTAyMzE3","user":{"login":"ScrapCodes","id":992952,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5Mjk1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/992952?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes","html_url":"https://github.com/ScrapCodes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-23T16:53:50Z","updated_at":"2014-07-23T16:53:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"it would be good, if you could describe when do you get this NPE ?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49902317/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49904887","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1460#issuecomment-49904887","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1460","id":49904887,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5OTA0ODg3","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-23T17:13:19Z","updated_at":"2014-07-23T17:13:19Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA tests have started for PR 1460.

That means that, in most cases when data is cached, there would be only one \"preferred\" host for each partition, so that might have unwanted side-effects. The locality would still be NODE_LOCAL even though, in practice, it's more like PROCESS_LOCAL.\n\nOtherwise, choice 2 seems to be the closer to what I think would be ideal. It seems weird to return (host, TaskLocality) though, since it wouldn't make sense to return (\"x\", RACK_LOCAL) for example. But I think this is the most flexible solution.\n\n3 seems like it's just 2 in disguise; instead of enforcing type-safety in the API, you'd have to do runtime checks that the returned strings make sense.
