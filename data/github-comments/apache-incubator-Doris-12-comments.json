And this requires the statistic of size of a row of data in memory.\r\n\r\nI will leave this Issue opened and try to resolve it sometimes later.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/547930873/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/547931891","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/2013#issuecomment-547931891","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/2013","id":547931891,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NzkzMTg5MQ==","user":{"login":"wuyunfeng","id":5183061,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxODMwNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5183061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuyunfeng","html_url":"https://github.com/wuyunfeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuyunfeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuyunfeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuyunfeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuyunfeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuyunfeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuyunfeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuyunfeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuyunfeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuyunfeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-30T14:27:58Z","updated_at":"2019-10-30T14:27:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-doris/issues/2106","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/547931891/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/547933569","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/issues/2036#issuecomment-547933569","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/2036","id":547933569,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NzkzMzU2OQ==","user":{"login":"morningman","id":2899462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTk0NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2899462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman","html_url":"https://github.com/morningman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-30T14:30:55Z","updated_at":"2019-10-30T14:30:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It works well with trunk code, so I think this is already fixed.

have analyse the two problems of this test.\r\n1. char65535 load job is failed. This is becasue there is max_body_size limit for brpc message. The batch sent  between BE for char65535 when loading data is too large which lead to failure when rpc. This can be fixed by limit the batch size under the max_body_size or set brpc_max_body_size to a bigger number in BE.\r\n2. char10 is too big. The reason is that the dict page's size limit is default to 1M and the dict is too large, DictEncoding automatically switch to BinaryPlainEncoding. BinaryPlainEncoding is less effiecient than V1. I will optimize the PlainEncoding later.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/548237258/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/548240109","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/issues/2113#issuecomment-548240109","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/2113","id":548240109,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0ODI0MDEwOQ==","user":{"login":"kangpinghuang","id":40422952,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNDIyOTUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40422952?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangpinghuang","html_url":"https://github.com/kangpinghuang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangpinghuang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangpinghuang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangpinghuang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangpinghuang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangpinghuang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangpinghuang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangpinghuang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangpinghuang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangpinghuang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-31T06:57:49Z","updated_at":"2019-10-31T06:57:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I

All bitmap_union_int query will make BE down. \r\nHere are the create table sql and some rows:\r\n`CREATE TABLE table1 (\r\n  k1 date NOT NULL COMMENT \"key1\",\r\n  k2 varchar(20) NOT NULL COMMENT \"key2\",\r\n  k3 varchar(100) NOT NULL COMMENT \"key3\",\r\n  k4 int(11) NOT NULL COMMENT \"key4\",\r\n  id int(11) NOT NULL COMMENT \"id\",\r\n  flag bigint(20) SUM NOT NULL DEFAULT \"1\" COMMENT \"flag\"\r\n) ENGINE=OLAP\r\nAGGREGATE KEY(k1, k2, k3, k4, id)\r\nCOMMENT \"OLAP\"\r\nDISTRIBUTED BY HASH(`k1`) BUCKETS 6\r\nPROPERTIES (\r\n\"storage_type\" = \"COLUMN\"\r\n);`\r\nRows:\r\n`2018-01-01,主键二,主键三,10000001,1000001,1\r\n2018-01-02,主键二,主键三,10000002,1000002,1\r\n2018-01-03,主键二,主键三,10000001,1000003,2`\r\nThe last column is used to calculate `count(1)`.\r\nTHX!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/548442525/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/548654395","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/issues/2115#issuecomment-548654395","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/2115","id":548654395,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0ODY1NDM5NQ==","user":{"login":"kangkaisen","id":9894906,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4OTQ5MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9894906?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangkaisen","html_url":"https://github.com/kangkaisen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangkaisen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangkaisen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangkaisen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangkaisen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangkaisen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangkaisen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangkaisen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangkaisen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangkaisen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-01T03:38:26Z","updated_at":"2019-11-01T03:38:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@XShun I just tried reproducing this issue, but bitmap_union_int work well. \r\nSo I want to be confirm again,  If you only load dozens of line raw data to `table1`, the `select bitmap_union_int(id) from table1` will make BE down?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/548654395/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/548669633","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/issues/2115#issuecomment-548669633","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/2115","id":548669633,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0ODY2OTYzMw==","user":{"login":"hxianshun","id":34292183,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjkyMTgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34292183?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hxianshun","html_url":"https://github.com/hxianshun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hxianshun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hxianshun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hxianshun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hxianshun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hxianshun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hxianshun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hxianshun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hxianshun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hxianshun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-01T05:18:04Z","updated_at":"2019-11-01T05:18:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@kangkaisen I just insert into `table2` 10 rows from `table1`, the structure of `table2` is the\r\nsame to  `table1`.
