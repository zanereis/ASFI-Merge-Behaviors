Nevertheless I can still move it to the error check list.\r\n\r\nThat's a fair point... :smile: I didn't even think of that. Here are 2 reasons why I suggest you still do:\r\n\r\n1. it's probably \"clearer\" to future new developers to the project if they see Errors from EP, instead of just Warnings, which then cause the build to anyway fail - just because, by \"convention\", Warnings _normally_ don't cause build failure, in Java. (I'm assuming that Error Prone's reporting issues errors instead of warnings, once you explicitly list everything.)\r\n\r\n2. how much do you want to bet that at some point, in future years, when people who are currently active on his project have moved on, and others maintain it, someone disagrees with making all warnings errors, and removes that again? (Or someone may do that in a private in-house fork.) They would then also loose all Error Prone validation which by default is just a warning, but that you are working hard on fixing and enforcing. If you make all EP checks errors, then it's more \"durable\" - independent of the `-Werror` thing.\r\n\r\nMakes sense? OK for you to raise a PR adding what is in so far, and doing so going forward?\r\n\r\n@awasum FYI","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/637755487/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/637755852","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/963#issuecomment-637755852","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/963","id":637755852,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzNzc1NTg1Mg==","user":{"login":"thesmallstar","id":42006277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMDA2Mjc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42006277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar","html_url":"https://github.com/thesmallstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-02T19:21:52Z","updated_at":"2020-06-02T19:22:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"That probably happened during a rebase(unintentional), fixed it.

You suggested gradually, in a serious of several smaller PRs, right? So I guess what you could do is just remove actually already adding the `<module name=\"ConstantName\" />` to `fineract-provider/config/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml` here (because it's not fully complete yet, right?), and rebase and un-draft this, and I'll merge it pronto (tomorrow), if it builds of course, and then you can keep doing that? \r\n\r\nThen when only you are fully done, you raise a last

Edit: preferences cannot be exported as XML, and spotless only wants .XML (hence this extra step was needed\r\n\r\nUnderstood, but https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/blob/master/ECLIPSE_SCREENSHOTS.md gives me the impression that x1 EPF can be exported as xN XML - one for formatting, another one for Organize Imports, right? Let's do that. One that the Spotless doc doesn't show is for _Preferences > Java > Code Style > Clean Up_ (which in the EPF I've extensively customized for Fineract) - that's your 3rd XML.  You can ignore Code Templates (because I have not customized those; although it could be nice to have them with the License header... but that's separate).\r\n\r\nOnce you have done that, for any other Preferences see what you can spot in the EPF that is still not in the XML. What we should do IMHO, to avoid \"redundancy\", is just to manually edit and strip out anything from the EPF that you have put into XML, and only keep a very small EPF! At least 2 things which I suspect will be left that I see (in Eclipse) are the _Preferences > Java > Compiler > ..._ settings, as well as the _Preferences > Java > Editor > Save Actions_. Those are great, and in January I have extensively customized those for Fineract. [It looks like there is no easy way to export those](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22891425/eclipse-importexport-actions-in-save-actions-option) (link), so just keep anything related to that in a manually edited small EPF.\r\n\r\nPS: Here's an idea for a future follow-up, not for this PR: I think the right way to eventually replace what will be left in an EPF is to try to put it all into a Gradle configuration. But reading https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/856, it looks like this is not (easily) possible, yet... :sob: An alternative in the mean time may be to simply switch from workspace global properties in the EPF to actually just have `fineract-provider/.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs` in Git (instead of `.gitignore`) instead of using EPF, assuming that it contain what will be left in the EPF. I can make that switch later, once we are done with this PR (unless you want to already do it as part of this here).\r\n\r\nHope this makes sense and helps and is not too confusing.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/638080245/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/638140582","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/965#issuecomment-638140582","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/965","id":638140582,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzODE0MDU4Mg==","user":{"login":"ptuomola","id":2398858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzOTg4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2398858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola","html_url":"https://github.com/ptuomola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-03T11:37:26Z","updated_at":"2020-06-03T11:37:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@vorburger For a project builder, you have to choose at least one of the options from: after a clean, during manual builds, during auto builds, during a clean.
