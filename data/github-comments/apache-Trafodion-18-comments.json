I see the code below in EXECUTE method in SqlInterface.cpp. This code below expects the isClosed flag in SRVR_STMT_HDL to be set to TRUE after initialization and the execute to set to FALSE upon successful execution. I think the path taken by the getTypeInfo() call to execute the query is not setting the flag to FALSE after execution. That needs to be fixed rather than setting this flag to FALSE in the constructor. Logically, the SRVR_STMT_HDL is in closed state till the query is prepared and executed. The execution of the query changes it to open state.\n\nif(GlobalInformation::getSQLMX_Version() == CLI_VERSION_R2)\n        {\n                pSrvrStmt->isClosed = FALSE;            // Assume we are open after EXEC_Exec\n\n```\n            if (pSrvrStmt->sqlStmtType & TYPE_SELECT) retcode = CLI_Exec(pStmt, pInputDesc, 0);\n            else retcode = CLI_ExecFetch(pStmt, pInputDesc, 0);\n    }\n    else                            // VER 2.1\n    {\n            // Should be Closed.
