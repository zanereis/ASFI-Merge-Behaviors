it.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612502238/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/58483015","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/287#issuecomment-58483015","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/287","id":58483015,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NDgzMDE1","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-10-09T09:17:17Z","updated_at":"2014-10-09T09:17:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1

This does not relate to your commit since you didn't invent the System.exit(11) thingy, however it would make things worse when a process is not responding.

Personally I would like to see ShellBolt and ShellSpout tested with true unit tests that don't rely on storm.py being there, but because we release everything together I am OK with just relying on the integration tests in the other three jars for now.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612504199/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/59226497","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/291#issuecomment-59226497","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/291","id":59226497,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5MjI2NDk3","user":{"login":"revans2","id":3441321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDEzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3441321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2","html_url":"https://github.com/revans2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-10-15T15:41:27Z","updated_at":"2014-10-15T15:41:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I am +1 for this change.
