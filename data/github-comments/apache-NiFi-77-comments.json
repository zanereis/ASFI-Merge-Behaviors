I should probably have read through all the comments before adding my own :) Sorry about that. I did notice though, that you have resources for \"DISK\" and \"NETWORK\" but they are not used anywhere. I would imagine that any processor that changes the content of the FlowFile would get a \"DISK\" one - which is a very large number of them. And perhaps even processors that read the content? I wonder if that's actually necessary. Since the Processor shows how much data is being read/written in the 5 minute stats, I wonder if we could just drop that? Similarly, I think that the NETWORK utilization may be kind of inferred in most cases - any processor that interacts with an external service is likely to have high network utilization. But not sure it makes sense to label every single one of those. Would recommend that we either remove those or add javadocs explaining when exactly we recommend using those annotations if we are not going to use them for each processor that touches flowfile content / network.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/369026396/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/369030344","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2475#issuecomment-369030344","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2475","id":369030344,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2OTAzMDM0NA==","user":{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-27T21:21:34Z","updated_at":"2018-02-27T21:21:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thinking about this a little more, I think that the DISK resource makes a lot of sense to have but I think we should document as to when to use it - that being, it should be used if the Processor would use the disk in a way that may not be intuitive. For example, ConvertRecord perhaps does not need it, given that it reads the records once and writes them once, which is what would be expected for converting from one format to another.\r\n\r\nHowever, QueryRecord is a great example of where this annotation would make sense. This is because QueryRecord will read the data up to N number of times, where N is the number of SQL statements supplied. DetectMimeType is also an interesting example, because I would expect it to read through all of the FlowFile content, but in some cases it is able to read only a few bytes, I believe, to determine the content's mime type.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we should treat the NETWORK one the same way? Or potentially drop it? I don't know of any cases off the top of my head that would use the network in any unexpected way.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/369030344/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/369144824","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2493#issuecomment-369144824","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2493","id":369144824,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2OTE0NDgyNA==","user":{"login":"tasanuma","id":11712443,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzEyNDQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11712443?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tasanuma","html_url":"https://github.com/tasanuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tasanuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tasanuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tasanuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tasanuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tasanuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tasanuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tasanuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tasanuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tasanuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-28T07:21:52Z","updated_at":"2018-02-28T07:21:52Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi @david-streamlio.

I've been thinking about writing processors for interacting with Pulsar myself but haven't had a chance yet. Just a few things that we should think through a bit:\r\n\r\n- Re: Connection Pool in controller service vs. doing it in the processor: what makes sense here I think depends on how you expect to use it. If you expect to be creating several Pulsar processors with the same connection info, then a Controller Service makes sense. If you think the more common case will be a single instance of the Processor then configuring it in the Processor is probably easier for the user. I think both have their merits though, so I'm fine with either approach personally.\r\n\r\n- One concern that I have is that with the Kafka processors, we end up having to create a new copy of the processors with pretty much each release of Kafka, so that we can take advantage of the new features. Have you considered how you see this evolving as more versions of Pulsar are released? There are two approaches that we often see with NiFi. One is to create a new processor for each new version as we did with Kafka. The other is to have a \"Client Service\" Controller service. It would then have methods like publish(FlowFile), consume() or something like that. Then there is only a single ConsumePulsar processor and a single PublishPulsar processor. Each is then just configured with the controller service that handles interacting with Pulsar directly. Either approach is okay, I think. But we should probably think about naming at least - does it make sense to name these ConsumePulsar_1_20 or ConsumePulsar_1_0 or something of that nature? I think it's best to figure this part out before the initial release because it can then become confusing if we have processors like ConsumePulsar and ConsumePulsar_1_35 for instance.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/369289825/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/369290640","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2477#issuecomment-369290640","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2477","id":369290640,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2OTI5MDY0MA==","user":{"login":"pvillard31","id":11541012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTQxMDEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11541012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31","html_url":"https://github.com/pvillard31","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-28T16:12:29Z","updated_at":"2018-02-28T16:12:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1.

This has been a great learning experience for me, and I am happy to contribute back to such a great project. I am still new to developing processors, so I really appreciate the feedback on my design and these are great points I hadn't considered.\r\n\r\n- I decided to go with a ControllerService, because I envision the user will only have 1 or 2 Pulsar clusters they are interacting with, therefore it made more sense to have a controller service that the user can configure once (Broker URL & SSL ControllerService), and pull Publishers and Consumers  from a single pool. I believe that the common usage pattern will be to have small number of Producers, that leverage the expression language to route the messages to multiple topics. I would expect Consumers to be configured to a single topic/subscription pair to feed data into the flow.\r\n\r\n- I have not given much thought to how we are going to handle Pulsar client evolution from these processors to be honest, as I don't expect the API to change drastically. Having said that, I think it is safe to at least associate these with the major version number of Pulsar just in case there is a major functionally shift between 1.x and 2.x. I am ok with naming these ConsumerPulsar_1_0. \r\n\r\n- Can you point me to an example of the \"Client Service\" Controller pattern you mention?

Without that, you end up having to split your data up into tons of FlowFiles and then push each one individually to Pulsar. So you would have to use a SplitText, SplitJson, SplitAvro, etc. type of processor if the data is already 'batched together.' But if we had a PublishPulsarRecord, you can skip having to split the data up. It turns out that splitting the data up becomes quite expensive because instead of a single FlowFile containing 10,000 records you now have 10,000 FlowFiles, each with their own attributes, their own Provenance events, etc. So the record-oriented processors allow the flow to be much more efficient, and they also allow easy conversion, validation, etc. so the flows are also easier to build and maintain. So even without a schema registry integrated into Pulsar, the record-oriented approach is very helpful for the users building the flow.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/369348196/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/369348885","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2486#issuecomment-369348885","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2486","id":369348885,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2OTM0ODg4NQ==","user":{"login":"MikeThomsen","id":108184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODE4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen","html_url":"https://github.com/MikeThomsen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-28T19:10:33Z","updated_at":"2018-02-28T19:10:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 LGTM.

Since the schema would be generated by the reporting task, then we could create a schema for the example above, but then each flow file would have its own schema, and even worse, each flow file would have only one metric, so at that point it's not really conducive to record processing. As an alternative we could convert the output (before or after JSON conversion) to an altered spec with a consistent schema definition. \r\nFor the Ambari reporting task, since Ambari is expecting this format, then fine; if we keep the same spec in this new reporting task for consistency, then I'd hope to see a template on the Wiki using the new reporting task with a JoltTransformJSON processor to do the aforementioned transformation, along with including an AvroSchemaRegistry that contains the schema definition for the files coming out of the JoltTransformJSON processor. This would allow us to keep a consistent (standard) defined format (albeit non-schema-friendly), but offer a well-known solution to prepare the data for record-aware processors.

I think we can just update the AvroTypeUtil#createSchema(Schema, String, SchemaIdentifier) with something like this:\r\n```\r\n                Object defaultValue = field.defaultVal();\r\n                if (fieldSchema.getType() == Schema.Type.ARRAY && !DataTypeUtils.isArrayTypeCompatible(defaultValue)) {\r\n                    defaultValue = new Object[0];\r\n                }\r\n                recordFields.add(new RecordField(fieldName, dataType, defaultValue, field.aliases(), nullable));\r\n```\r\nAnd I think that will address the issue without breaking anything else.

Thanks for the extra info!  We can do additional PRs to add more descriptions as needed, but I think the default descriptions are good to at least mark the current processors that might cause resource issues.\r\n\r\nAs @joewitt mentioned, the annotation doesn't need to be used just to convey that a component might use a lot of a particular resource.  It can also include descriptions on how to best utilize the resources, or indicate that the component uses very little of a type of resource and can parallelized to a high degree without degrading system performance.  I can agree that currently, there aren't many components that would use the DISK or NETWORK SystemResource type when referring to how a single flowfile would affect them, but there may be in the future.

this is not the final version, I still have unit tests and \"additional details\" doc to add, but wanted to give you an update in case you want to have a look and if you already have feedbacks.\r\n\r\nI've reworked the new reporting task as I suggested with two additional properties. I also reworked the way metrics are constructed to have the ambari format and the \"record\" format with the minimal code duplication. I also chose this implementation (using the JsonTreeReader) so that we can easily reuse the code for the other S2S reporting task. If it sounds OK to you, adding an optional Record Writer property to the other S2S reporting tasks should be really easy (I guess best is to take care of it into a follow-up JIRA).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/370174201/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/370193206","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2505#issuecomment-370193206","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2505","id":370193206,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MDE5MzIwNg==","user":{"login":"jvwing","id":3151078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTEwNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3151078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing","html_url":"https://github.com/jvwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-04T01:06:46Z","updated_at":"2018-03-04T01:06:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The extra close is a result of my carelessness, sorry.
