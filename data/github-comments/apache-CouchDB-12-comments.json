(This needs to be run from the same build tree that was installed.) \n- make clean -  Erase from the build tree the files built by make all. \n- make distclean - Also erase anything ./configure created. \n- make check - Run the test suite, if any. \n- make installcheck - Check the installed programs or libraries, if supported. \n- make dist - Recreate package-version.tar.gz from all the source files. \n\nSometimes you will find other things like make install-strip, etc. Usually you don't need all of them (uninstall, check, installcheck aren't always there), but it seems like the couchdb Makefile mostly adheres to these defaults, just the release/distclean stuff is deviating a little from the norm and is exposing these issues.\n\nIn a way we are stepping one by one into the different issues that autotools was created to solve. I don't want to suggest that you stop and autotoolize couchdb, because that is another world of pain, but there is a point where you end up doing so many of the things that it solves that the pain of doing that is going to be a lot less than solving those again yourself (not to mention the support over time)... just something to keep in mind.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/75807216/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/77425413","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/308#issuecomment-77425413","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/308","id":77425413,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3NDI1NDEz","user":{"login":"janl","id":11321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl","html_url":"https://github.com/janl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-05T18:51:53Z","updated_at":"2015-03-05T18:51:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@robertkowalski

@micah on make uninstall what is expected to happen with user-data that was created by the package? Like databases that might still have important data, are they expected to be rm’d? I understand logs could go, but I’m hesitant to include databases.\n\nregarding user-data, most linux distros follow the File Hierarchy Standard (FHS) and the package would handle the creation, and optional removal, of this data. For example, on debian, it would likely be that the package will create /var/lib/couchdb and the configure script would be run to set that as the directory for this data, and /var/log/couchdb would be be where logs go. The packaging system usually asks you about those things on removal, asking you if you want to remove the databases? are you sure? are you REALLY SURE?! So, I dont think a make distclean/clean etc. should touch that stuff\n\nRegarding the most recent updates, they have eliminated the problems with files changing, being removed from unpacked source that were in the tarball, great! Now the only problem is that after the first build, the following ones fail (even after a make distclean) because these files remain:\n\ntmp/\ndev/boot_node.beam\ndev/data\ndev/lib\ndev/pbkdf2.pyc\nlog/crash.log\ndev/logs\n\nThe other issue I've been struggling with is that even if I pass a relative path to the -p option to configure, its still trying to use the absolute path on installation. So for example, I've been trying to do ./configure -p debian/couchdb/usr (here because this is where the package wants the resulting build so it can then take everything in there and make a package that would then install into /usr), but during the make install phase this happens:\n\n```\nmkdir: cannot create directory ‘/usr/local/couchdb’: Permission denied\n```\n\nIt makes sense that I get a permission denied, because I am building as my unprivileged user, but I dont know why it is trying to use that directory, when I specified the -p option.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/90751051/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/91920174","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/302#issuecomment-91920174","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/302","id":91920174,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDkxOTIwMTc0","user":{"login":"janl","id":11321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl","html_url":"https://github.com/janl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-11T20:01:09Z","updated_at":"2015-04-11T20:01:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@micah good findings, I keep chipping away at them.
