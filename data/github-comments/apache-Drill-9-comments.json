avoided.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/211443568/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/211443930","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/483#issuecomment-211443930","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/483","id":211443930,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMTQ0MzkzMA==","user":{"login":"jaltekruse","id":365366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NTM2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/365366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaltekruse","html_url":"https://github.com/jaltekruse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaltekruse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaltekruse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaltekruse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaltekruse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaltekruse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaltekruse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaltekruse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaltekruse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaltekruse/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-18T15:56:18Z","updated_at":"2016-04-18T15:56:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Is

I spent more time looking at ways to create a unit test for this, and I don't think it's possible:\nFirst, current implementation of ProtobufLengthDecoder for the data tunnel uses the root allocator, which is weird and changing the rpc max allocation won't help in this case.\nSecond, even after I changed the implementation and made sure ProtobufLengthDecoder uses the rpc allocator, this same allocator is used by netty too and you can't control where it will run out of memory, in most of my experiments it run out of memory in ByteToMessageDecoder, so writing a unit test using this won't be

The current patch also does not build as there is no artifact for Arrow 0.1-SNAPSHOT.\n2) I see that the entire memory module of Drill is gone. I don't think that drill memory management and accounting should be outsourced to Arrow. I can see needing to use ArrowBuf for value vectors but removing the entire memory module is not OK. I can see other uses of Direct/Heap memory (caching metadata for example) that should be managed under a Drill resource manager. This ties back to #1. Arrow needs to get its design figured out to allow Drill and other projects to manage their resources while providing a 'reference' implementation. \n-1 until we resolve this.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/214433058/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/214565715","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/482#issuecomment-214565715","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/482","id":214565715,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNDU2NTcxNQ==","user":{"login":"parthchandra","id":6529136,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MjkxMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6529136?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra","html_url":"https://github.com/parthchandra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-25T23:50:55Z","updated_at":"2016-04-25T23:50:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1.

I added a comment in code, but it does not completely address your concerns.\n\nUnfortunately, not all class (e.g. RootAllocator) can be instrumented for metrics if the single instance is part of a contextual object. Static instance is fine according to [library doc](https://dropwizard.github.io/metrics/3.1.0/getting-started/#the-registry). This means maintaining state in a static object. Is there a workaround?\n\nAFAIK we do not provide a way to run multiple drillbits in the same JVM in production use cases.

I'm not sure why you only want to make it work for file system schema, and return \"information not available\" for other schema. Also, what's the reason to only show \"location\"? What if we add support for other schemas, and will \"location\" still make sense for non-filesystem schema?\n\nTo me, it would make more sense to return all the properties of schema for \"describe schema/database\", as a JSON format string.  The properties could be anything defined in the schema. For file system schema, it could be location, whether writable, default input format, etc. For other schemas, there would be schema-dependent properties.  In case we add new properties to schema in later release, there is no need to change the implementation of \"describe schema\".  In other words, \"describe schema/database\" should return the content shown in webui storage tab for that particular schema. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/218630539/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/218763967","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/436#issuecomment-218763967","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/436","id":218763967,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxODc2Mzk2Nw==","user":{"login":"arina-ielchiieva","id":15086720,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDg2NzIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15086720?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva","html_url":"https://github.com/arina-ielchiieva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-12T13:53:55Z","updated_at":"2016-05-12T15:22:17Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@jinfengni, \nI agree that it could be useful to display content shown in webui storage tab as well.\nI have added new column `properties` which will contain this information.\nI will still keep physical_location in separate column as it's generated from several properties (from FileSystemConfig.connection and WorkspaceConfig.location) plus it's was one of initial requirements\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/218763967/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/218786032","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/436#issuecomment-218786032","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/436","id":218786032,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxODc4NjAzMg==","user":{"login":"jinfengni","id":5742011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDIwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5742011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfengni","html_url":"https://github.com/jinfengni","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfengni/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfengni/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfengni/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfengni/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfengni/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfengni/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfengni/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfengni/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfengni/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-12T15:04:50Z","updated_at":"2016-05-12T15:04:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@arina-ielchiieva ,\n1. the link you posted is actually not a public document.

Once the foreman is ready to process events it will check if there are any events in the queue and process them otherwise they will be processed by the threads that will add them.\nWe are still assuming processing an event does not block\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/219571472/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/219573757","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/503#issuecomment-219573757","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/503","id":219573757,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxOTU3Mzc1Nw==","user":{"login":"hnfgns","id":3476250,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NzYyNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3476250?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hnfgns","html_url":"https://github.com/hnfgns","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hnfgns/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hnfgns/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hnfgns/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hnfgns/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hnfgns/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hnfgns/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hnfgns/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hnfgns/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hnfgns/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-16T23:00:52Z","updated_at":"2016-05-16T23:00:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I see that you are enabling task hand-off for the first task in the serializer as well.
