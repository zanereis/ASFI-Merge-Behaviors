More specifically, the problem is that ARQ collation doesn't work with the Fuseki Docker image, apparently due to lack of locale support (though the underlying issue might be different or more complicated than just lack of locales). Copying my analysis from the relevant Skosmos issue:\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI tested this with the example query from the [Jena ARQ Collation](https://jena.apache.org/documentation/query/collation.html) documentation. I put this in `collation.rq`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPREFIX arq: <http://jena.apache.org/ARQ/function#>\r\nSELECT ?label WHERE {\r\n    VALUES ?label { \"tsahurin kieli\"@fi \"tšekin kieli\"@fi \"tulun kieli\"@fi \"töyhtöhyyppä\"@fi }\r\n}\r\nORDER BY arq:collation(\"fi\", ?label)\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen ran it against the Fuseki Docker container using `rsparql` (from Jena) and the result was this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ rsparql --query collation.rq --service http://localhost:9030/skosmos/sparql\r\n-----------------------\r\n| label               |\r\n=======================\r\n| \"töyhtöhyyppä\"@fi   |\r\n| \"tsahurin kieli\"@fi |\r\n| \"tšekin kieli\"@fi   |\r\n| \"tulun kieli\"@fi    |\r\n-----------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is not the correct, locale-aware order; `tsahurin kieli` should be first and `töyhtöhyyppä` last. So I think that the Fuseki container configuration should be modified to enable support for locale-aware collation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1697375359/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1697396005","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/issues/1997#issuecomment-1697396005","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/1997","id":1697396005,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec5lLDUl","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-29T12:57:24Z","updated_at":"2023-08-29T12:59:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"That is relying on a Jena-specific feature.\r\n\r\nBy the standards, blank nodes in the results format are scoped to the result document, not across documents.

If we regenerate yarn.lock (by \"rm yarn.lock; yarn install\" - is there a better way?) won't dependabot changes be lost?\r\n\r\nNot sure. We'd have to look at the transitive dependencies (babel deps are not listed in our package.json, I think). The lock contains the sate of dependencies at one point in time.\r\n\r\nIf we delete the lock file, and re-create it, that will be a new point with the latest dependencies, which probably don't have the version with the security issue.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like we can try changing our `dependabot.yml` to use that setting in versioning-strategy: https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file#versioning-strategy.\r\n\r\nThat should make dependabot to update the lock file and also `package.json`. But I am not sure about dependencies that are not in our list of dependencies. I don't think it will add something to ... resolutions? Can't recall the name of the key used to pin down versions. But maybe it's worth a shot if you prefer to use package.json.\r\n\r\nI normally don't delete the lock files. \r\n\r\n>I tried yarn upgrade-interactive - build failed - I get a lot of 404's (below)\r\n\r\nNever tried that utility of yarn. I just run `npx ncu ...` to ask npm to check and update dependencies from the NPM registry, then update my dependencies in `package.json`, freeze the dependencies again in my lock file and commit it. Then dependabot keep that lock file free of security issues (which should be fixed in the transitive dependencies, otherwise I think Dependabot gives one of those error messages \"Dependabot is not able to generate a pull request for this issue etc etc\").\r\n\r\nSometimes a dependency just cannot be upgraded, because it depends on another version that conflicts with another library already in use. In cases like this we can only wait -- unless it is in Vue, for example, which would be critical as that's used in the final apps -- for issues in the dev libraries it's normally fine.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1769271756/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1770389435","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/2043#issuecomment-1770389435","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/2043","id":1770389435,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec5phf-7","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-19T09:10:24Z","updated_at":"2023-10-19T09:10:24Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for the explanation and background.\r\n\r\nI've tried just updating the yarn.lock file for this PR and it builds 😃.\r\n\r\nAs this one is critical, let's do this.

It's development related.\r\n\r\nThen there are two security items related to cypress so that's development only.\r\n\r\nThe other is related to nodemon (test/build) having an older dependency on semver which is blocking upgrade in product dependencies elsewhere - the code dependencies are upgradable.

There is a long timescale history and a very slow/careful evolution in the standards and implemnentations on the web.\r\n\r\nBrowsers handle all this for the user so often the user does not notice. Toolkits nowadays often seem to do it as well (the newer `java.net.http`, for example) so applications rarely see this. But if you push on detail and correctness, it can show though.\r\n\r\nNowadays, I see \"URI\" beginning to be used generally and interchangeably with \"IRI\" with \"IRI\" fading away.\r\nThe extreme case of this is https://url.spec.whatwg.org/ where \"URL\" is used for everything within the HTML area.\r\n\r\nURI = [RFC3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986)\r\nIRI = [RFC3987](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3987)\r\n\r\nIRIs (Unicode) are abstract and have to be mapped to URIs to be used.\r\n\r\nThe HTTP infrastructure grew up around old URLs which have an ALPHA production `[A-Z][a-z]` of ABNF [RFC2234](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2234). When using someone else's server, you can't rely on the server understanding e.g, UTF-8.\r\n\r\nIn parallel, there is also [punycode](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc3492/) to be able to write non-ASCII host names in strict ASCII URLs so that DNS can be used for the host name.\r\n\r\nJava `java.net.URI` isn't even RFC3986 - it's the closest to the preceding [RFC2396]https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2396) but I don't think it's every going to be updated.\r\n\r\n`jena-iri` started because compliance to the standards was not great.\r\n\r\nIn Jena, we now have an abstraction `IRIx` and a test suite of expectations (in the `jena-core`) so that the URI/IRI library can be switched. We'll replace use of `jena-iri` with the new code sometime; `jena-iri` will remain for testing and for a part of the legacy code which isn't normally used by apps but is available.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1773725617/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1773785051","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/2047#issuecomment-1773785051","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/2047","id":1773785051,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec5puc_b","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-21T13:06:00Z","updated_at":"2023-10-21T13:06:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@shawnsmith Looks good to me.

They are known as r-component, q-component, and f-component [...] each of these components has a distinct role that is independent of any given URN and its URN namespace. It is intended that clients will be able to handle these components uniformly for all URNs. These components MAY be used with URNs from existing URN namespaces, whether or not a URN namespace explicitly supports them.\r\n\r\n[RFC 8141 Section 2.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8141#section-2.2):\r\n\r\n> The NSS is a string, unique within a URN namespace, that is assigned and managed in a consistent way and that conforms to the definition of the relevant URN namespace.\r\n\r\n[Section 2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8141#section-2):\r\n\r\n> Rules not defined here (specifically: alphanum, fragment, and pchar) are defined as part of the URI syntax [[RFC3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986)]\r\n\r\nWhile indeed [RFC 4122](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4122) does not allow them, my assumption would be that [RFC 4122](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4122) (and others) simply describe what is allowed in the “Namespace Specific String” for that specific \"Namespace Identifier\". The optional components would therefore be out-of-scope (in regards to whether it is allowed) for [RFC 4122](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4122). It might define explicit support, though not mentioning it should still mean these are allowed if I understand the above correctly.
