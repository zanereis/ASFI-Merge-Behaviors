If the plugin doesn't currently support I'm sure it would be an easy add.\r\n\r\nSorry I wasn't very clear there. I was thinking about a more infrastructure level. For us to actually host our official image on Dockerhub there must be a unique tag, commit, and directory that points to our Dockerfile for a specific Docker tag. So if we had a minor release we would need to create a new directory. That is why in this commit I have the two directories \"1.1.0\" and \"1.1.1\" to illustrate that. I don't like that structure at all but it almost seems necessary to host via Dockerhub. This is somewhat of a limitation for \"official\" images only which most likely other users of the docker-maven-plugin are not doing but rather making internal release and sending to their own private docker repos.\r\n\r\nSo when we made a PR to https://github.com/docker-library/official-images our PR would be a single file looking something like ...\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/docker-library/official-images/blob/master/library/storm","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/270385910/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/270390231","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1309#issuecomment-270390231","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1309","id":270390231,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MDM5MDIzMQ==","user":{"login":"bbende","id":605416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTQxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende","html_url":"https://github.com/bbende","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-04T14:58:21Z","updated_at":"2017-01-04T14:58:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Reviewing...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/270390231/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/270390995","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1372#issuecomment-270390995","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1372","id":270390995,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MDM5MDk5NQ==","user":{"login":"apiri","id":502889,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjg4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/502889?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri","html_url":"https://github.com/apiri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-04T15:01:23Z","updated_at":"2017-01-04T15:01:23Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I think the tags should be fine and it is okay to continuously version the one, true Dockerfile with each release.  From a release perspective, it would be on the RM to kick off the various processes that would generate a build with the new tag, but our core, source release is the Dockerfile and whatever periphery we may choose to include (in future releases, this could include things like compose files).  We could likely additionally make use of maven filtering to have the needed versions get updated.\r\n\r\nInsofar as tagging/versions, I have taken a similar approach with the image I have been maintaining: https://hub.docker.com/r/aldrin/apache-nifi/tags/.  Upon each update, I tag that source and push both that commit and tag to the repository.  This manifests itself as the latest version being tagged latest and its respective version.  When a new version comes out, latest is advanced to correspond to the same image generated from the new tag.\r\n\r\nFor the official repo as provided, we could just add the new version to that list and keep it there as long as supported.  Given our release structure, this seems to coincide pretty well with the guidance provided at https://github.com/docker-library/official-images#library-definition-files.  As certain versions become obsolete/unsupported, those associated entries would be purged.  I think this also allows us to get away from the directory structure as every release we perform will have a new commit which we can reference whilst keeping a consistent path to the Dockerfile.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/270390995/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/270391173","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1372#issuecomment-270391173","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1372","id":270391173,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MDM5MTE3Mw==","user":{"login":"ai-christianson","id":24681233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjgxMjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24681233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ai-christianson","html_url":"https://github.com/ai-christianson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ai-christianson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ai-christianson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ai-christianson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ai-christianson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ai-christianson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ai-christianson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ai-christianson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ai-christianson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ai-christianson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-04T15:02:01Z","updated_at":"2017-01-04T15:02:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jdye64 Interesting, wasn't aware of the restrictions with the official docker hub.

@pvillard31 for tackling this. I reviewed the code and tested. While this PR fixes toDate to work even when an attribute value is null, there's another method that throws NPE, that is StandardAttributeExpression.evaluate.

Besides that, when I tested toNumber passing a non-existing attribute, it works fine, before applying this fix.\r\n\r\nSo I looked at the code closer and found NumberToDateEvaluator may be the one should be fixed, because functions below react against null input value as followings:\r\n\r\n- NumberToDateEvaluator returns `null` <-- We probably need to fix this to return new DateQueryResult(null)\r\n- StringToDateEvaluator returns new DateQueryResult(null)\r\n- WholeNumberCastEvaluator returns new WholeNumberQueryResult(null) : this is an implementation for toNumber() function\r\n\r\nIt seems returning XXXQueryResult(null) is a convention in EL functions when input is null.\r\n\r\nHow do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/272994244/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/272999628","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1381#issuecomment-272999628","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1381","id":272999628,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3Mjk5OTYyOA==","user":{"login":"ijokarumawak","id":1107620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak","html_url":"https://github.com/ijokarumawak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-17T01:35:43Z","updated_at":"2017-01-17T01:35:43Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"All LGTM, +1!
