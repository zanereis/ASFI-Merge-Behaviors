spend 10 minutes trying to figure out what it is doing because the method names aren't helping at all.\r\n\r\nThe widely-accepted notion that the name of a class and test method are supposed to be enough documentation for test is quite questionable IMO; and by enforcing a javadoc on the class we give a little nudge to make the developer hopefully think about whether something needs to be
