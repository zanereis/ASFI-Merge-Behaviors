There is a case not taken into account in this PR.\r\n\r\nLet's assume we have these configs:\r\n- the cleaning policy is `KEEP_LATEST_FILE_VERSIONS`\r\n- the incremental cleaning is activated\r\n- and the `cleaner.fileversions.retained` is X\r\n\r\nif in the next clean we use a `cleaner.fileversions.retained`  >= X, everything is fine, we just need to check the changed partitions since the last clean and clean them. But if in the next clean we change the `cleaner.fileversions.retained`  to any value < X, we will not be able to use the incremental cleaning, and we will need to run the method `getPartitionPathsForFullCleaning` to recheck all the partitions.\r\n\r\nSo to decide if we can use the incremental cleaning or we need to run a brute force check, we need to save the  `cleaner.fileversions.retained` value used in the last clean in the clean commit avro file.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1301473361/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1301490604","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/7076#issuecomment-1301490604","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/7076","id":1301490604,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5Nkyus","user":{"login":"hudi-bot","id":79415918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDE1OTE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79415918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/hudi-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-02T23:32:04Z","updated_at":"2022-11-02T23:32:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\nMeta data\n{\n  \"version\" : 1,\n  \"metaDataEntries\" : [ {\n    \"hash\" : \"82cc7354ee41a3983583dc8a5455110c9b66f0f6\",\n    \"status\" : \"DELETED\",\n    \"url\" : \"https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=12620\",\n    \"triggerID\" : \"82cc7354ee41a3983583dc8a5455110c9b66f0f6\",\n    \"triggerType\" : \"PUSH\"\n  }, {\n    \"hash\" : \"a2d3672965a7bce164434b6cf64a7ec422db71da\",\n    \"status\" : \"DELETED\",\n    \"url\" : \"https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=12625\",\n    \"triggerID\" : \"a2d3672965a7bce164434b6cf64a7ec422db71da\",\n    \"triggerType\" : \"PUSH\"\n  }, {\n    \"hash\" : \"565b83f6ba744fd62312d9e2dff8dbf6956d6b80\",\n    \"status\" : \"DELETED\",\n    \"url\" : \"https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=12694\",\n    \"triggerID\" : \"565b83f6ba744fd62312d9e2dff8dbf6956d6b80\",\n    \"triggerType\" : \"PUSH\"\n  }, {\n    \"hash\" : \"d4f5107ca1bd9bba7bda422609072e971f89f12c\",\n    \"status\" : \"SUCCESS\",\n    \"url\" : \"https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=12736\",\n    \"triggerID\" : \"d4f5107ca1bd9bba7bda422609072e971f89f12c\",\n    \"triggerType\" : \"PUSH\"\n  } ]\n}-->\n## CI report:\n\n* d4f5107ca1bd9bba7bda422609072e971f89f12c Azure: [SUCCESS](https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=12736) \n\n<details>\n<summary>Bot commands</summary>\n  @hudi-bot supports the following commands:\n\n -
