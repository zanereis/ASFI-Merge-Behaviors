far we used slightly different approach for GCP services:\r\n1) In most cases (and this is preferred per official google recommendations) instead of discovery API we used the new python-idiomatic APIs, specific for each service. See for example here: https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/airflow/contrib/hooks/gcp_spanner_hook.py \r\nDiscovery API is officially deprecated by Google (but still works so far)\r\n\r\n2) whenever there is no  python-idiomatic API or it is not enough, discovery API is used (for example: https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/airflow/contrib/hooks/gcp_compute_hook.py). Each such hook is implemented separately (and it's usually not a lot of code per hook - especially the query method is usually few lines of code)\r\n\r\n3) In both discovery and idiomatic APIs we use this base hook (it provides authentication that is usable by both types of APIs + exception handling + default project_id handling): https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/airflow/contrib/hooks/gcp_api_base_hook.py\r\n\r\nThe only part which is not in the gcp_api_base_hook.py (from this proposal) is some common way of handling pagination. \r\n\r\n@feluelle  -> are you aware of the implementation ? Do you see any problem with following the approach of other GCP operators that you need to solve? Maybe the pagination could be implemented in the gcp_api_base_hook instead if you think it's worth to implement some common code?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/496952575/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/496984039","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4005#issuecomment-496984039","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4005","id":496984039,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5Njk4NDAzOQ==","user":{"login":"aoen","id":1592778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTI3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1592778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoen","html_url":"https://github.com/aoen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-29T15:22:43Z","updated_at":"2019-05-29T17:03:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ashb Tests were passing for me before I merged this several times, and it looks like the old logs are gone.

I thought so before and checked other columns with the same file, but the problem is not with all columns, it's with execution_date since it is used part of key between dag to dag_run and also to other tables. If SQL server rounds a time columns that is not referenced or used as part of join to fetch data, then it's ok. This one is necessary since it used to trigger and acts as bridge.
