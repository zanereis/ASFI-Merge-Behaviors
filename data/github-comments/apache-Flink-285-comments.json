The lowerBound and upperBound are used by RocksDB's interface to avoid wasting time on deleted values. The situation is not the same when storing state in heap. Do you still think that we should support the new API for all `MapState` implementations? Also, I do not understand the meaning of \"declare the method as a best-effort filter\". Because previous implementation will return all the values and it is just the bottleneck in our situation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/445098945/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/445103065","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/7180#issuecomment-445103065","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/7180","id":445103065,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NTEwMzA2NQ==","user":{"login":"walterddr","id":3581352,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1ODEzNTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3581352?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr","html_url":"https://github.com/walterddr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-07T02:38:35Z","updated_at":"2018-12-07T02:38:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @lamber-ken sorry for the late response.

All of this has to be resolved and it becomes harder to understand and reason about the code. This can be avoided if scheduler and slot pool run in the same thread, and we are also aiming at having all modifications to the execution graph in the same thread as well. The threading model would then be that blocking or expensive operations run in their own thread so that the main thread is never blocked, but the results are always synced back to a main thread to

I'm wondering what the exact problem is which we are facing here. To me it looks as if the `flink-shaded-hadoop2` and `flink-shaded-curator` module correctly relocate the curator dependency. Therefore, there should be no problem with differing Curator versions.\r\n\r\nI would suspect that this problem arises if you run the test out of IntelliJ because it does not correctly respect relocated resources: https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-93855. Moreover, if you use a Maven version higher than `3.2.5`, then you need to run your build twice in order to generate the relocated artifacts.\r\n\r\nI was able to run `ZooKeeperStateHandleStoreTest` with Hadoop version 2.6.5 and Maven version 3.2.5 by calling `mvn verify -pl flink-runtime`.

think this suggestion is problematic for the following reasons:\r\n1. Map state is in general unordered\r\n2. Keys in map state are not required to be `Comparable`, so what defines the order against which we can compare upper and lower keys?\r\n3. Even if keys implement, `Comparable`, their order in RocksDB is depending on the lexicographical order of there bytes in serialized form, which can be a differnt order from what can be defined in the `compareTo()`\r\n4. The method is doing different things for RocksDB and Heap right now and this is not properly reflecting in the documentation of the method.\r\n\r\nOverall that leads me to the conclusion that we cannot rush to add this optimization but need a bit more careful thinking, e.g. introducing a subclass OrderedMapState (openly or hidden and cast where optimization is required). Even in that case we need to be careful when addressing the problem of different orders (`Comparable` vs byte-lexicographical) and I feel that needs more thought. So currently I am leaning towards 👎 for the suggested approach.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/446148429/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/446148631","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6777#issuecomment-446148631","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6777","id":446148631,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NjE0ODYzMQ==","user":{"login":"azagrebin","id":10573485,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTczNDg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10573485?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/azagrebin","html_url":"https://github.com/azagrebin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azagrebin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azagrebin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azagrebin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azagrebin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azagrebin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azagrebin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azagrebin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azagrebin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azagrebin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-11T10:19:41Z","updated_at":"2018-12-11T10:19:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@klion26 right, sorry for confusion.\r\nI think we should move `DirectExecutorService` into `org.apache.flink.runtime.concurrent`.\r\nWe have already there `Executors.directExecutor()`.
