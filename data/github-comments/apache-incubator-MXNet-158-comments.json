Suppose some client code created a simple MLP:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndata = mx.sym.Variable('data')\r\nfc1 = mx.sym.FullyConnected(data=data, name='fc1', num_hidden=100)\r\nact1 = mx.sym.Activation(data=fc1, name='act1', act_type='relu')\r\nfc2 = mx.sym.FullyConnected(data=act1, name='fc2', num_hidden=10)\r\nout = mx.sym.SoftmaxOutput(data=fc2)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen we have some host code we're writing that will receive a symbol. In this case, out. What I would like to be able to do, is from that single symbol received determine what the input symbols are. If I call list_arguments() on out, what it will give me is data and the labels, because those are the variables in the graph. But I want the input symbols; that is, I want it a minimum to return me fc2 (and the internally created softmax labels symbol). And if it returns me fc2, that means I could similarly query it for its input symbols, which would return act1; and so on.\r\n\r\nBeing able to explore the symbol graph, along with reflection, facilitates programmatic adaptation of graphs. Here's one possible way I might use that. Suppose I have a non standard RNN structure (not LSTM or the usual layers). With the ability to explore the graph, I could create a function that took an arbitrary zero-time step graph with a specification of any cyclic edges and have it automatically unroll the graph to an arbitrary time horizon. But there are other things that could be done too.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/277527704/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/277528846","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/4833#issuecomment-277528846","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/4833","id":277528846,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NzUyODg0Ng==","user":{"login":"ap-hynninen","id":4775826,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NzU4MjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4775826?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ap-hynninen","html_url":"https://github.com/ap-hynninen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ap-hynninen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ap-hynninen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ap-hynninen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ap-hynninen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ap-hynninen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ap-hynninen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ap-hynninen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ap-hynninen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ap-hynninen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-05T16:01:32Z","updated_at":"2017-02-05T16:01:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@piiswrong  I thought the requirement was >= 3.0 all along.

I ran mxnet on multi-machine and the program hangs after several epochs. \r\n```\r\nfor i in range(10):\r\n    python dmlc-submit --cluster mpi --num-servers 2 --num-workers 8  --hosts host  python train.py xxx\r\n```\r\nThe program hangs when i > 1 occasionally. I observed that the process still exists after finishing last epoch  training. Would this cause the hang problem since they may use the same DMLC_PS_ROOT_PORT  @mli ? Do I need to kill the program manually after each mpi training?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/277568680/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/277574567","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/4887#issuecomment-277574567","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/4887","id":277574567,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NzU3NDU2Nw==","user":{"login":"feiyulv","id":18651286,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxMjg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651286?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feiyulv","html_url":"https://github.com/feiyulv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feiyulv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feiyulv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feiyulv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feiyulv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feiyulv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feiyulv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feiyulv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feiyulv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feiyulv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-06T02:41:40Z","updated_at":"2017-02-06T02:43:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This is the log when set PS_VERBOSE=1.
