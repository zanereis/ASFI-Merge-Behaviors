I don't think this is up for debate.\r\n\r\n`ALL_SUCCESS_OR_SKIPPED` is a reasonable new trigger rule.\r\n\r\nThe real question is how `SKIPPED` states should propagate in virtue of trigger rules. I believe that the current behavior is that the branching operator recurses and marks tasks as `SKIPPED` on all of the branches it's not taking. That recursion part should probably not live in the operator, but in the scheduler. In the specific case of `ALL_SUCCESS` and one of the upstream tasks being `SKIPPED`, I think that the task should be `SKIPPED` if the branching operator did not already mark it as `SKIPPED` (in the case where a DAG changes shape in the meantime).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/287111047/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/287144939","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2161#issuecomment-287144939","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2161","id":287144939,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NzE0NDkzOQ==","user":{"login":"mention-bot","id":15710697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzEwNjk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15710697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/mention-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-16T18:11:11Z","updated_at":"2017-03-16T18:11:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@UnclaimedPants, thanks for your PR!

Thanks for the clarification.\r\n\r\nOn a related note, what is the latest stable release? PyPI [shows 1.7.1.3](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/airflow/1.7.1.3). JIRA [doesn't have a release date](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:summary-panel) for that version and [shows 2 unresolved issues for it](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/fixforversion/12336740/?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:version-summary-panel); it also shows [1.8.0 as having a release date of 2017-02-02](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/fixforversion/12339190/?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:version-summary-panel) and with 0 unresolved issues. There [is a Git tag for 1.8.0](https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/tags), but that tag seems to be getting overwritten regularly. (For example, it used to point at https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/commit/310fb589ae867ff2ec8b7ce3cc5b1659db4dad49, but was changed recently to point at https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/commit/f4760c320a29be62469799355e76efa42d0b6bb2.) (I'm unfamiliar with Apache's conventions, so am uncertain what source to consider the canonical reference.)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/287218556/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/287223593","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2139#issuecomment-287223593","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2139","id":287223593,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NzIyMzU5Mw==","user":{"login":"ldct","id":130362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/130362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ldct","html_url":"https://github.com/ldct","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ldct/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ldct/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ldct/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ldct/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ldct/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ldct/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ldct/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ldct/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ldct/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-16T23:30:23Z","updated_at":"2017-03-16T23:30:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"👍 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/287223593/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/287223659","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2152#issuecomment-287223659","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2152","id":287223659,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NzIyMzY1OQ==","user":{"login":"jlowin","id":153965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Mzk2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/153965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin","html_url":"https://github.com/jlowin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-16T23:30:44Z","updated_at":"2017-03-16T23:30:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Latest stable is 1.7.1.3.

Sorry for the trouble!\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, BranchPython, ShortCircuit, and LatestOnly operators all only set their **direct** downstream tasks as `SKIPPED` (https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/blob/1.8.0/airflow/operators/python_operator.py#L109). So the states of any task past that is determined by the trigger rule logic. Agreed it sounds like logic should be handled in the scheduler, but it probably still to has be defined somehow by the operator? For example, I assume all tasks downstream from `LatestOnly` should be skipped despite any `ALL_SUCCESS` trigger rule. But tasks downstream from a `Sensor` with `soft_fail=True`...should fail if it has an `ALL_SUCCESS` trigger rule, I think?\r\n\r\n@aoen I filed https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-983 a few
