you guys,\r\nAs @addisonj mentioned we spoke (thanks a lot for effort) about improvements and i have some things that may be good\r\n\r\n- command for unsetting offload policies for namespace so it can go back to default `pulsar-admin namespaces unset-offload-policies`\r\n- command for getting default offload policies(**EDIT**: this actually you can see in broker.conf so it is not that important)\r\n- Sparse properties saved for namespaces, if property is set for namespace use it, if not go back to default. (this one maybe is not that important but it is nice for this usecase: i wan't for every namespace to use default driver, bucket, etc.. and only to change offload threshold, so if i use set-offload-threshold, only threshold can be saved in namespace offload properties, and then if i want to change bucket or other common property for namespaces i can only change it in default (**from configuration**) and won't need to do it for every namespace like i need

I haven't tried it myself, but there's a note that it doesn't work with the shaded client and you should use pulsar-client-original dependency instead of pulsar-client.\r\n\r\nThanks, I'll review this and check if it's possible to use it. I'm unaware about pulsar-client-original and what's the difference between non \"original\" one. If they are the same then I can switch to it if it passes tests. However this is not only for JSON it's also mentioning other Schema translator substitutions so it would help if they have more than just ObjectMapper.. However I'll check it out even just JSON is good enough for now.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/713651608/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/713665152","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/8249#issuecomment-713665152","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/8249","id":713665152,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxMzY2NTE1Mg==","user":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-21T15:36:13Z","updated_at":"2020-10-21T15:36:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> For example, there are no ack test in AbstractWebSocketHandlerTest.
