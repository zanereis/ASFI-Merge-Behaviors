I'm not quite sure why we need an \"official\" branch for this feature in the repo itself. We have never done that to date. Can you not work on this feature on a fork and incrementally merge the bits into master? Merging this once it's done into master is kinda impractical anyway.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/508364370/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/508418170","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/4539#issuecomment-508418170","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/4539","id":508418170,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwODQxODE3MA==","user":{"login":"jiangpengcheng","id":1858477,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTg0Nzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1858477?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangpengcheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-04T09:45:26Z","updated_at":"2019-07-04T09:45:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think change the `default_image_tag` to `nightly` in `ansible/group_vars/all` should be better comparing to change travis configuration in other projects like [incubator-openwhisk-cli](https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-cli)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/508418170/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/508424417","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/4539#issuecomment-508424417","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/4539","id":508424417,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwODQyNDQxNw==","user":{"login":"jthomas","id":2322,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jthomas","html_url":"https://github.com/jthomas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jthomas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jthomas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jthomas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jthomas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jthomas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jthomas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jthomas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jthomas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jthomas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-04T10:04:25Z","updated_at":"2019-07-04T10:04:25Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This seems sensible to me but I'm not familiar enough with the configuration to make a judgement on whether this is the best approach.

am not quite sure but I think the issue is happening in this way.\r\n\r\n`MesosContainerFactory` ask to the `mesosClientActor` which is `testActor` in test cases. \r\n```scala\r\nprivate def subscribe(): Future[Unit] = {\r\n    logging.info(this, s\"subscribing to Mesos master at ${mesosConfig.masterUrl}\")\r\n    mesosClientActor  // here\r\n      .ask(Subscribe)(mesosConfig.timeouts.subscribe)\r\n      .mapTo[SubscribeComplete]\r\n      .map(complete => logging.info(this, s\"subscribe completed successfully... $complete\"))\r\n      .recoverWith {\r\n        case e =>\r\n          logging.error(this, s\"subscribe failed... $e}\")\r\n          if (closed) Future.successful(()) else subscribe()\r\n      }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n    factory = new MesosContainerFactory(\r\n      wskConfig,\r\n      system,\r\n      logging,\r\n      Map(\"--arg1\" -> Set(\"v1\", \"v2\"), \"--arg2\" -> Set(\"v3\",

testTaskId _)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince `testActor` does not respond to the request `Subscribe`, `ask` request will be timed out and be caught by `recoverWith`.\r\n`recoverWith` logic will be asynchronously executed by another thread and the thread will call `subscribe()` again and be timed out recursively.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I think one easy way could be to define a simple testing actor which respond with static `SubscribeComplete` response against `Subscribe` request and pass the testing actor to the `MesosContainerFactory` instead of using just `testActor`.\r\n(We may want to define `AutoPilot` instead of defining a simple actor, but anyway)\r\n\r\nSince I did not look into the `MesosContainerFactory` logic in-depth, it would be great if @tysonnorris confirm this behavior once.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/510420965/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/510818245","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/4555#issuecomment-510818245","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/4555","id":510818245,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMDgxODI0NQ==","user":{"login":"mhenke1","id":15377852,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Mzc3ODUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15377852?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhenke1","html_url":"https://github.com/mhenke1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhenke1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhenke1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhenke1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhenke1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhenke1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhenke1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhenke1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhenke1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhenke1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-12T09:25:45Z","updated_at":"2019-07-12T09:25:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@KeonHee
