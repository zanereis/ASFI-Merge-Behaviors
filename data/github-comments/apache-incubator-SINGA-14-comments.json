The C++ test error can be found [here](https://github.com/moazreyad/singa/runs/855402800?check_suite_focus=true#step:6:98). Can anyone fix this error and make sure that the C++ test passes before we add it to this workflow of the Github Action? The problem happens when we compile SINGA with ENABLE_TEST=ON, and run the unit tests by ./bin/test_singa\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/issues/comments/657314106/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/issues/comments/657314363","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/singa/pull/761#issuecomment-657314363","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/issues/761","id":657314363,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1NzMxNDM2Mw==","user":{"login":"nudles","id":3797447,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3OTc0NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3797447?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles","html_url":"https://github.com/nudles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-13T01:36:25Z","updated_at":"2020-07-13T01:36:25Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@chrishkchris could you help check the cpp test cases? thanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/issues/comments/657314363/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/issues/comments/657324170","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/singa/pull/760#issuecomment-657324170","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/issues/760","id":657324170,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1NzMyNDE3MA==","user":{"login":"Shashankwer","id":15552734,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTUyNzM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15552734?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shashankwer","html_url":"https://github.com/Shashankwer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shashankwer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shashankwer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shashankwer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shashankwer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shashankwer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shashankwer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shashankwer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shashankwer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shashankwer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-13T02:21:45Z","updated_at":"2020-07-13T02:21:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @joddiy,\r\n\r\nWould we be considering only 2 dimensions for the scatter_elements operation?\r\nFor backwards operation with scatter_elements can we store the indexes we process during the forward pass, this can help us reducing the time complexity for the operation?\r\nAlso for implementing the advanced indexing operation, we can implement it as a suboptimal operation for processing the index as a list of tuples and further indexing only based on those list of tuples?

There is a function in [scheduler.cc](https://github.com/apache/singa/blob/dev/src/core/scheduler/scheduler.cc#L116) which can be used to print the graph info. If we want to visualize the graph, we can use this function to obtain the structure info of the neural network and then use some python library(e.g. matplotlib and networkx) to achieve that. In other words, we need to change the source code.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/issues/comments/671822400/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/issues/comments/671927190","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/singa/pull/110#issuecomment-671927190","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/issues/110","id":671927190,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3MTkyNzE5MA==","user":{"login":"lijiansong","id":10958439,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU4NDM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10958439?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijiansong","html_url":"https://github.com/lijiansong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijiansong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijiansong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijiansong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijiansong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijiansong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijiansong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijiansong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijiansong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijiansong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-11T12:50:17Z","updated_at":"2020-08-11T12:50:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@XJDKC
