think this would only apply to the the topologies in the executors, which are written in their own language and user execution environment - generally this is probably best left to the users to find a balance between their language, cluster, log shipping, and application logging needs. Even going through every piece of code that write a log message and may be able to determine it's topology name, then putting that into the log message in a consistent format, might not yield much.\r\n\r\nThat would leave me tempted to close this as a non-issue/no great solution or requirement.\r\n\r\n_p.s. in Kubernetes the general approach is to log to stdout and let leave aggregation to the cluster's log shipping. For me, the ideal is to have logs rendered into a JSON envelope (e.g. `{\"level\": \"info\", \"message\": \"become the log\", \"tag\": \"value\"}`). Then it can be nicely loaded into an ELK stack with a JSON filter (or similar elsewhere), then elements of data are very easy to explore and
