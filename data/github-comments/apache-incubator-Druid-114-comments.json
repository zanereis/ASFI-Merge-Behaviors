in our system we have lots of datasources, so in overload it will create lots of tasks, when the times go, the table will biggger than before so that it will influence query from mysql. Now we just add index in druid_pendingSegments table, and it make the query fast a lot. So I think we can first simplely add indexes to this table and than cleanup the table automatically.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/259023298/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/259061922","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/3665#issuecomment-259061922","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3665","id":259061922,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1OTA2MTkyMg==","user":{"login":"kaijianding","id":8663725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NjM3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8663725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijianding","html_url":"https://github.com/kaijianding","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijianding/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijianding/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijianding/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijianding/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijianding/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijianding/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijianding/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijianding/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijianding/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-08T07:04:41Z","updated_at":"2016-11-08T16:35:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Here is the detail process how this error happens.\n1. run the old task with hour segmentGranularity and announce two segments: s1 (\"2016-10-31T00:00:00.000+08:00/2016-10-31T01:00:00.000+08:00\", \"v1\", NumberedShardSpec(0, 2)) and s2 (\"2016-10-31T00:00:00.000+08:00/2016-10-31T01:00:00.000+08:00\", \"v1\", NumberedShardSpec(1, 2)), and finaly handoff s1 and s2\n2. user can query\n3. kill the old task and disable s1 and s2 in db, but brokers will remove s1/s2 from memory several minutes later due to druid.coordinator.period on coordinator side and the time needed to unload s1/s2 from historicals\n4. reset checkpoint and immediately run the new task to read from 2016-10-31T00:00:00.000+08:00 (we have an internal product like kafka with the ability to rewind from specified timestamp) and use day segmentGranularity\n5. announce s3 (2016-10-31T00:00:00.000+08:00/2016-11-01T00:00:00.000+08:00\", \"v1\", NumberedShardSpec(0, 2)) and s4 (2016-10-31T00:00:00.000+08:00/2016-11-01T00:00:00.000+08:00\", \"v1\", NumberedShardSpec(1, 2))  \n   5.1 in BrokerServerView.serverAddedSegment, timeline.add(...) adds s3/s4 to allTimelineEntries but failed to add to completePartitionsTimeline due to overlap error, then selectors.put(segmentId, selector) is not called and queryableDruidServer is not bound to the selector\n6. administrator gets the \"can't overlap error \" alert\n7. brokers remove s1/s2, and add s3/s4 to completePartitionsTimeline in VersionedIntervalTimeline.remove(...) \n\n```\n    for (Map.Entry<Interval, TreeMap<VersionType, TimelineEntry>> versionEntry : allTimelineEntries.entrySet()) {\n      if (versionEntry.getKey().overlap(interval) != null) {\n        if (incompleteOk) {\n          add(timeline, versionEntry.getKey(), versionEntry.getValue().lastEntry().getValue());\n        } else {\n          for (VersionType ver : versionEntry.getValue().descendingKeySet()) {\n            TimelineEntry timelineEntry = versionEntry.getValue().get(ver);\n            if (timelineEntry.getPartitionHolder().isComplete()) {\n              add(timeline, versionEntry.getKey(), timelineEntry);\n              break;\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n```\n- 8. query can find the s3/s4 when timeline.lookup() called, then \"No servers found for SegmentDescriptor\" raised in CachingClusteredClient due to s3/s4 don't have any server bound to selector, as mentioned in step 5\n- 9. administrator gets the \"No servers found for SegmentDescriptor\" alert, and try to kill the new task to remove s3/s4  \n  9.1 In BrokerServerView.serverRemovedSegment(), because selectors don't contain s3/s4 as mentioned in step 5, and then allTimelineEntries/completePartitionsTimeline is kept no change  \n  9.2 administrator gets the \"No servers found for SegmentDescriptor\" alert continually  \n  9.3 administrator try to run old task and read from 2016-10-31T00:00:00.000+08:00 again, and s1/s2 are announced again, but failed due to overlap error (s1 conflicts with s3, s3 is still in allTimelineEntries as mentioned in step 9.1)  \n  9.4 administrotor either can restart old task like 9.3, or restart new task again.

`PickledGraphite`, it seems the socket is marked as connected, so it failes to reconnect.\n\nWe suggest calling the `close()` method before calling `connect()`, like so :\n\n```\npickledGraphite.close();\nlog.info(\"trying to re-connect to graphite server\");\npickledGraphite.connect();\n```\n\nAnd also calling it after calling `flush()` (in the end of `run()`), like so :\n\n```\ntry {\n          pickledGraphite.flush();\n} catch ( IOException e) {\n          log.error(e, e.getMessage());\n          if (e instanceof SocketException) {\n            log.warn(\"closing connection to graphite server\");\n            pickledGraphite.close();\n         }\n}\n```\n\nThat way, we'll actually be able to reconnect (albeit loosing the current batch of metrics).\nWe've tried it in our environment, and it seems to work.\n\n@b-slim @l15k4 - what do you
