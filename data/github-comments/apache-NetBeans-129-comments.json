Forcing users/reviewers to do a forced push or request one sounds stupid and I remembered, that gitlab had an option to manually trigger CI/CD pipelines and it turns out github has something similar:\r\n> \r\n> https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/manually-running-a-workflow https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#workflow_dispatch\r\n> \r\n> This would allow a reviewer add labels and then trigger a run. What do you think?\r\n\r\nthanks for taking a look @matthiasblaesing I can always count on you for reviews :)\r\n\r\nI fully agree that this is currently the most annoying aspect of this change, I haven't figured out how to solve this though. Here the issues:\r\n\r\n - if a workflow is manually triggered via `workflow_dispatch` it can't access the pr-context since there is none, it would simply run on a branch. So it would see no labels etc, it would also not show up below the PR as checkmark i am afraid (not tested but i can't see how it would)\r\n - there are various [other triggers](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#available-events) available. E.g it would be possible to trigger if someone adds or removes a label on the PR. but this would be overkill. Due to the limitations of the declarative yaml file I don't know how to trigger only on a certain label (I don't think its currently possible), it would run on every add or remove event.\r\n\r\nI haven't given up on that. Ideas welcome.\r\n\r\nWe have still options though:\r\n- we could let unlabeled PRs run everything instead of the minimum job count, (`ci:all-tests` equivalent) would this be a better default? disadvantage: this could make committers lazy and never label anything which would cancel out this effort here\r\n- or we could check if it is even a problem in practice: how often does it happen that a new contributor submits a perfect PR which would create the awkward situation of a reviewer having to label the PR and request a sync? another aspect: maybe the default jobs already cover the PR well enough if its a trival change\r\n- (I should probably also update the PR template text to mention that PRs should be labeled before pressing create)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1264147789/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1264271541","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/4650#issuecomment-1264271541","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4650","id":1264271541,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5LW0C1","user":{"login":"kresoSusec","id":113850461,"node_id":"U_kgDOBsk4XQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/113850461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kresoSusec","html_url":"https://github.com/kresoSusec","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kresoSusec/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kresoSusec/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kresoSusec/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kresoSusec/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kresoSusec/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kresoSusec/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kresoSusec/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kresoSusec/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kresoSusec/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-01T07:06:49Z","updated_at":"2022-10-01T07:07:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> @kresoSusec is there any progress on this one?\r\nNothing new.

But as tom cruise would say: we need two miracles in succession. First the manual dispatch would have to actually appear under the PR if its even possible to run them on PR branches. Second: dispatch can use up to 10 input variables on its form, i could try to map them to labels somehow. I hope you can use them in job conditions since there are some things you can't use: e.g env vars for entirely undocumented reasons.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1264488347/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1264494300","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/4652#issuecomment-1264494300","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4652","id":1264494300,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5LXqbc","user":{"login":"mbien","id":114367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien","html_url":"https://github.com/mbien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-01T22:13:25Z","updated_at":"2022-10-01T22:13:25Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"null is actually a valid return value:\r\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/net/URLConnection.html#getContentType()\r\nso the JDK should probably check for that (haven't looked at the code yet since the source I am looking at doesn't match the line numbers :P).\r\n\r\nIt could still be invalid input which ends up throwing the internal NPE.

If the label trigger works, IMO we could also consider going back to minimal tests by default from the start.\r\n\r\nwhen I read the doc this indeed seemed to be the obvious way how to solve this issue. But this dissipated quickly:\r\n - labeled events are fired for each label. So if you put 3 labels on a pr it will start 3 workflows + the open event which makes 4. We have the concurrency rule which would shut down all workflows except the newest, but this would still create a lot of noise on the /actions page\r\n - we use do-not-merge/stale/bugfix etc labels for meta-info. This can become a problem when someone accidentally resets a build someone else is looking at\r\n - i sometimes go around and add labels to PRs so that they will go the right category on the feature list. Since not all labels are used as conditions, this would make me fixup less since it would cause unnecessary builds just for cosmetics.\r\n - when someone would bulk label a bunch of PRs at once via the /pulls page it would simply cause too much building at once IMO\r\n\r\nhow about using the `unlocked` event as \"secret\" trigger for the workflow? I just tested it in a sandbox and it worked well\r\n - I don't think it sends mails (I am not sure, difficult to test with just one account, in fact, let me test this by locking this PR, you can tell me if you got a mail :)), close/reopen does\r\n - it is less invasive than 'reopened'\r\n - maybe one day gh will support better ways of doing this. e.g via adding a custom button to the checks or restarting workflows with a fresh context optionally\r\n\r\nI assume that most devs will try to label PRs correctly right away or will sync PRs several times anyway during review which gives enough opportunities to update labels. For new contributors and the event of a PR which does not need any changes, reviewers could use this semi-secret trick to trigger a new build after labeling the PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1264779169/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1264800068","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/4711#issuecomment-1264800068","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4711","id":1264800068,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5LY1FE","user":{"login":"mbien","id":114367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien","html_url":"https://github.com/mbien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-03T01:12:44Z","updated_at":"2022-10-03T01:16:23Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"i am no heavy gradle user.
