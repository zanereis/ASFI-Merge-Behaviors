I found two minor improvements. Can you correct your formatter. For example, Zeppelin uses an indentation of two spaces. Furthermore, the use of antlr4 must be included in the [license](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/22ae6cdcd1f526b66808c2b994b53f808f390cfe/zeppelin-distribution/src/bin_license/LICENSE#L288). Also, it would be nice if you upload screenshots of both frontends in the pull request description. Glad you've been reading up on the new Angular frontend. In my opinion, this one was always easier than the other.

All new dependencies and classes should also be located there.\r\n - It seems that in case of a complex query you modify the dataset with the JDBC interpreter at the source. With your current implementation, the user is not aware of this right away.\r\n - You want to cache complex queries with an LRUCache. Depending on the size of the cache, queries may not be removed from the cache and the user may see stale data. I think a time based cache would be more appropriate here.\r\n - Have you ever heard of PreparedStatements?\r\n - At first view your configuration options are only JDBC interpreter configuration, therefore the configuration should be stored only in the JDBC interpreter and not as global ZeppelinConfiguration.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/1582000098/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/1582001696","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/4563#issuecomment-1582001696","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/4563","id":1582001696,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAfU5DM5eS24g","user":{"login":"Reamer","id":454320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NDMyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/454320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer","html_url":"https://github.com/Reamer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-08T07:04:57Z","updated_at":"2023-06-08T07:04:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Feel free to prepare a PullRequest with JIRA ticket.

I glance at your PR and suggest you make a child interpreter like `jdbc.debug` instead of adding a menu. The debug paragraph is currently only for JDBC, but the menu would be exposed for all kinds of paragraphs. `zeppelin-interpreter` package and `NotebookServer` class affect all of interpreters. If you want to make an interpreter-specific feature, I recommend adding a new sub-interpreter.
