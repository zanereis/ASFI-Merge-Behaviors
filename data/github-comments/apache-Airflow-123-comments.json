Given the results above, it looks like every once a while fqdn can't be resolved so it defaulted to the hostname instead. \r\n\r\nNot familiar with why we started with using hostname... I guess that it was easier to read and easier to implement, since for IP a host can have multiple network interfaces with multiple IPs so we'd want to make sure the right one is selected. In terms of using IP instead of fqdn,  it sounds reasonable... as long as backward compatibility is addressed.\r\n\r\nGiven that getfqdn will return hostname if it fails to resolve...
