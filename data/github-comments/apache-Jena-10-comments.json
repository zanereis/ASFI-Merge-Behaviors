However, Fuseki isn't built at this point in the build process.\r\n\r\njena-rdfconnection goes into the apache-jena-libs and apache-jena artifacts but Fuseki is built after those.\r\n\r\nThis must be a common need in system so if there is a better common pattern, then I'm happy to switch to that.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of ways this could be done:\r\n\r\n1. Build modules in a different order - e.g. do building steps before delivery modules.\r\n2. Put the tests in Fuseki\r\n3. As here, a specific module.\r\n4. Use a previous version of Fuseki.\r\n\r\n(1) works in this case but it may not work out whereas the idea of an integration testing module, seems general. (2) is a less clean version of (1); this is already done in a small way - those can be moved now. (4) seems accident prone.\r\n\r\nSo (3) looks the best way and may be applicable for other situations. It may even to help unblock evolution of the legacy module/packing structure (the old Turtle reader in jena-core is needed for assembler tests - I haven't had a chance to try yet).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/267679474/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/267842771","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/197#issuecomment-267842771","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/197","id":267842771,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2Nzg0Mjc3MQ==","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-18T20:00:33Z","updated_at":"2016-12-18T20:00:33Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I wasn't happy with a single fixed way to use a local connection - I think all of copy (pseudo remote), no isolation and read-only (no copy so a pragmatic balance for larger datasets) make sense in different situations.\r\n\r\nso I have added two isolation modes added to the documentation and added tests.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/267842771/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/267995818","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/197#issuecomment-267995818","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/197","id":267995818,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2Nzk5NTgxOA==","user":{"login":"ajs6f","id":110994,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDk5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/110994?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f","html_url":"https://github.com/ajs6f","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-19T15:39:57Z","updated_at":"2016-12-19T15:39:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I am completely cool with the idea of separate i-test modules-- I think that's very much the right idea.
