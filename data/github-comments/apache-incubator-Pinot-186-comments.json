What happens if proper headers are there already ? Here the algorithm should not get this wrong and override the proper headers. How do we safeguard against this?\r\n> 2. What happens when there are no headers and we assign default headers\r\n> 3. What happens when there are no headers and we fail to detect and assign default\r\n\r\nGood point. \r\n\r\nI added more comments on the user experience. By the way, the current logic is the following:\r\n\r\n- Check the header\r\n- If header found, keep the existing behavior\r\n- if header not found, fill default header `col_0, col_1`\r\n\r\nThere can be 2 possibilities that the logic can go wrong:\r\n1. False negative:  detect 'no header' while there's a header <- in this case, we will replace the header to `col_0, col_1...` instead of honoring the header. I do see some reports on this. https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/104380\r\n2. False positive: detect 'header' while there's no header <- in this case, the end behavior would be the same as today because we will fall back to the original behavior when we detect the header (`format.withHeader()`). So, this would not cause any degradation.\r\n\r\nI think that `false negative` cases will cause new issues that doesn't exist today when this feature is turned on. However, I think that we need to incrementally improve the logic as we see more edge cases because it looks that the csv header detection cannot be perfect. When the user controls the csv config, they can override the header `.setHeader()` or turn off this feature.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1580148040/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1580172849","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/10861#issuecomment-1580172849","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/10861","id":1580172849,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5eL4Yx","user":{"login":"satish-mittal","id":3016626,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMTY2MjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3016626?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/satish-mittal","html_url":"https://github.com/satish-mittal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satish-mittal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satish-mittal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satish-mittal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satish-mittal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satish-mittal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satish-mittal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satish-mittal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satish-mittal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satish-mittal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-07T08:15:24Z","updated_at":"2023-06-07T08:15:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"The entire 10 minutes seem to be taken in index building only.

Here, CSVReader's `header` is indicating about the source schema. \r\n\r\nIn regular cases, `source schema + mapping (transform config) = pinot schema`.  So, it's the caller's responsibility to make the Pinot schema & record reader to be aligned. \r\n\r\nThe code is just changing the behavior on putting `header information`. If the header does not exist in today, we will try to use the first row as the header and we won't be able to read the data either.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1581665194/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1581669237","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/10871#issuecomment-1581669237","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/10871","id":1581669237,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5eRlt1","user":{"login":"abhioncbr","id":1076944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzY5NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1076944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhioncbr","html_url":"https://github.com/abhioncbr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhioncbr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhioncbr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhioncbr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhioncbr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhioncbr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhioncbr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhioncbr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhioncbr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhioncbr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-07T23:58:54Z","updated_at":"2023-06-07T23:58:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sounds good to me.

For example:\r\n- [Mixpanel Any Order](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/analysis/reports/funnels#ordering)\r\n- [Amplitude Any Order](https://help.amplitude.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052745632#h_6b432e9f-a491-439e-a2c6-005bc16bc6f6)\r\n\r\nI believe we can expand in future iterations on supporting temporal order constraints.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1583319291/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1583342815","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/10874#issuecomment-1583342815","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/10874","id":1583342815,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5eX-Tf","user":{"login":"swaminathanmanish","id":126024920,"node_id":"U_kgDOB4L82A","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/126024920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swaminathanmanish","html_url":"https://github.com/swaminathanmanish","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swaminathanmanish/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swaminathanmanish/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swaminathanmanish/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swaminathanmanish/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swaminathanmanish/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swaminathanmanish/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swaminathanmanish/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swaminathanmanish/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swaminathanmanish/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-08T21:06:03Z","updated_at":"2023-06-08T21:06:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@snleee , @rajagopr -
