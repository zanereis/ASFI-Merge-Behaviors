It could cause some skew since the memcached is shared and sharded by key, but hopefully pretty close regardless. The other option is to append to an async logger and assuming that it doesn't drop messages too frequently.\n\nThe ARC traces are the best I have so far, and they are each around 50 - 100mb gzip'd. The paper reports that they are 1-6 hours or a few days, I guess depending on how active the cache is for that product. Given @drcrallen's description of the concurrency challenges I suspect an hour is plenty if you have such high volumes. I would `xz` compresses for a much smaller file.\n\nI suspect your workloads have a lot of scans, so it will be interesting to see where the different policies line up.
