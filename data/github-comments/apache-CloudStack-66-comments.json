It's intent is to add the ability to set certain hv parameters with an end goal in 8978 of implementing hyper-V enlightenment features for Windows Server 2008 guests.\n\nThe current code for HyperVEnlightenmentFeatureDef only allowed the setting of the hv_relaxed bit.  This bit disables a windows sanity check that commonly results in a BSOD when the VM is running on a host under heavy load.\n\nThe change here adds the ability to set the hv_vapic and hv_spinlocks bits as well as retry time.  The hv_vapic bit tries to reduce interrupt overhead in guests.  The hv_spinlock bit is used by the guest to notify the hypervisor that the calling virtual processor is attempting to access a resource that may be held by another virtual processor.  For the host, the retry value for hv_spinlock indicates the number of times the virtual processor should attempt to access before the spinlock is considered excessive.\n\nBasically these changes are setting the stage for changes I am going to submit in CLOUDSTACK-8974.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/152675128/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/152707311","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1016#issuecomment-152707311","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1016","id":152707311,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MjcwNzMxMQ==","user":{"login":"remibergsma","id":1630096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzAwOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1630096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma","html_url":"https://github.com/remibergsma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-31T07:27:07Z","updated_at":"2015-10-31T07:27:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @mike-tutkowski thanks for the details in the jira ticket and the pr.
