I agree with your points. \n1). Let's move all sort logic into a SortStep including the merge part then pass the row to MDKeyGenStep. Then we can change the implementation of it without changing interface. \n2). We can do the similar way as Spark. In spark, there are [`ExternalSorter`](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/util/collection/ExternalSorter.scala) and [`UnsafeInMemorySorter`](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/util/collection/unsafe/sort/UnsafeInMemorySorter.java) for safe and unsafe version. `ExternalSorter` internally uses [`TimSort`](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/util/collection/TimSort.java), you  can see descrption of `sort` function about the space usage:\n\n```\nIn the worst case, this sort requires\n temporary storage space for n/2 object references; in the best case,\n  it requires only a small constant amount of space.\n```\n\nAnd for `UnsafeInMemorySorter`, it is sorting using a key prefix to approve CPU cache efficiency:\n\n```\n/**\n * Sorts records using an AlphaSort-style key-prefix sort. This sort stores pointers to records\n * alongside a user-defined prefix of the record's sorting key. When the underlying sort algorithm\n * compares records, it will first compare the stored key prefixes; if the prefixes are not equal,\n * then we do not need to traverse the record pointers to compare the actual records. Avoiding these\n * random memory accesses improves cache hit rates.\n */\n```\n\nIs it ok I do the 1) in this PR and leave 2) for future PR?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/carbondata/issues/comments/254372716/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/carbondata/issues/comments/254403301","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/carbondata/pull/243#issuecomment-254403301","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/carbondata/issues/243","id":254403301,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NDQwMzMwMQ==","user":{"login":"Vimal-Das","id":11293485,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjkzNDg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11293485?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vimal-Das","html_url":"https://github.com/Vimal-Das","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vimal-Das/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vimal-Das/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vimal-Das/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vimal-Das/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vimal-Das/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vimal-Das/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vimal-Das/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vimal-Das/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vimal-Das/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-18T04:23:21Z","updated_at":"2016-10-18T04:23:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@scwf

PR has two benefits:\n1. Modify the compressor inteface to make it easier to add new compressors, like adding no compression option, and other compressor like lz4, gzip, etc. Based on this PR, developer can add lz4 compressor in the future, which decompression speed is faster than snappy. I found a compression benchmark [here](https://github.com/ning/jvm-compressor-benchmark/wiki)\n2.
