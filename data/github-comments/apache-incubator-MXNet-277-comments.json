E.g. [batchnorm.st](https://github.com/indhub/mxnet/blob/caffe_translator/tools/caffe_translator/src/main/resources/templates/batchnorm.st).\r\n- Some sort of guidance/document on how the translator internally works will be useful since from what I see there are bunch of components for this translator. Such details will help 1. reviewers better do the review and 2. for anyone else who wants to fix any issues with the translator later on when you are not around.\r\n- No unit tests?\r\n- Do you think it'll be good to exit in case of exceptions like [this](https://github.com/indhub/mxnet/blob/caffe_translator/tools/caffe_translator/src/main/java/io/mxnet/caffetranslator/Solver.java#L56) or [this](https://github.com/indhub/mxnet/blob/caffe_translator/tools/caffe_translator/src/main/java/io/mxnet/caffetranslator/Converter.java#L284)? Basically fail fast in case of issues? Or would it make more sense to generate a code-comment which says \"// Couldn't convert <blah> lr policy\" and continue. Also, with that in mind, what do you think about having a force flag to the translator which if present ignores such errors and continues instead of exiting?\r\n- Probably integrate FAQ with the main README since main README doesn't have too much info? (this may just be my personal preference though).\r\n- Out of curiosity what happens when [this](https://github.com/indhub/mxnet/blob/caffe_translator/tools/caffe_translator/src/main/java/io/mxnet/caffetranslator/Converter.java#L362) returns null?\r\n\r\nFew points mainly around style:\r\n- Do you think having better class docs would be helpful for anyone trying to maintain the code?\r\n- Generally good to have braces for if statements even if it contains only one statement. Also spaces b/w if and () would be good everywhere. See [google braces guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s4.1.1-braces-always-used) and [whitespace guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s4.6.2-horizontal-whitespace) for more. I'm assuming fixing now would require too much effort w/o giving enough in return so feel free to choose accordingly.\r\n- I'm seeing some inconsistencies regarding use of final modifier. E.g. [here](https://github.com/indhub/mxnet/blob/caffe_translator/tools/caffe_translator/src/main/java/io/mxnet/caffetranslator/Converter.java#L48) and [here](https://github.com/indhub/mxnet/blob/caffe_translator/tools/caffe_translator/src/main/java/io/mxnet/caffetranslator/CreateModelListener.java#L40). Generally good to be strict unless we there is a reason to not be.\r\n- (Minor) Instead of calling this [GenHelper](https://github.com/indhub/mxnet/blob/caffe_translator/tools/caffe_translator/src/main/java/io/mxnet/caffetranslator/GenHelper.java#L33) GeneratorHelper may be a more appropriate name since it clearly says what is it about.\r\n- Also it would be good to expand the imports such as [this](https://github.com/indhub/mxnet/blob/caffe_translator/tools/caffe_translator/src/main/java/io/mxnet/caffetranslator/GenHelper.java#L33).\r\n\r\nFeel free to ignore comments in the interest of time/effort if necessary or if you don't agree with them :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/347362396/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/347363364","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/8836#issuecomment-347363364","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/8836","id":347363364,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NzM2MzM2NA==","user":{"login":"reminisce","id":4978794,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Nzg3OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4978794?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce","html_url":"https://github.com/reminisce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-27T23:27:02Z","updated_at":"2017-11-27T23:27:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think there is an undefined behavior of backend (C++) code, as the example behaves differently on different platforms with the latest master branch code.

@anirudh2290 @ZiyueHuang @piiswrong  any comment on converting shape (10) to (1,10) explicitly for csr & row_sparse arrays? I was thinking about making (10) to (10,1) for row_sparse array since it's usually for matrices of large number of rows, but it seems scipy always convert the shape consistently for csr & csc:\r\n```\r\n>>> a = np.ones((10))\r\n>>> a.shape\r\n(10,)\r\n>>> import scipy.sparse as spsp\r\n>>> spsp.csr_matrix(a)\r\n<1x10 sparse matrix of type '<type 'numpy.float64'>'\r\n        with 10 stored elements in Compressed Sparse Row format>\r\n>>> spsp.csc_matrix(a)\r\n<1x10 sparse matrix of type '<type 'numpy.float64'>'\r\n        with 10 stored elements in Compressed Sparse Column format>\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/347424436/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/347426000","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/8817#issuecomment-347426000","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/8817","id":347426000,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NzQyNjAwMA==","user":{"login":"reminisce","id":4978794,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Nzg3OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4978794?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce","html_url":"https://github.com/reminisce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-28T06:23:48Z","updated_at":"2017-11-28T06:23:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think it's natural to reshape a vector of shape (10,) to a matrix of shape (1, 10), placing 10 elements in the same row by inserting an axis before the existing one, so I agree that we follow the scipy's convention.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/347426000/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/347430542","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/8484#issuecomment-347430542","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/8484","id":347430542,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NzQzMDU0Mg==","user":{"login":"kkebo","id":601636,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMTYzNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/601636?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkebo","html_url":"https://github.com/kkebo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkebo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkebo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkebo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkebo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkebo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkebo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkebo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkebo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkebo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-28T06:51:39Z","updated_at":"2017-11-28T06:51:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Why don't you use `_get_attrs()`?
