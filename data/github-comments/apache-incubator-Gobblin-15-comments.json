actually I just realized using a plain integer has one problem: the `getApplicationReportFailureCount` is shared and updated in both event handlers `handleApplicationReportArrivalEvent` and `handleGetApplicationReportFailureEvent`, which may be called by different threads. So for any change to `getApplicationReportFailureCount` in any of the two event handlers to be visible to the other, it at least needs to be `volatile`. So I still think `AtomicInteger` is a good choice here and it offers more than `volatile` with thread

If you are moving from HDFS to the _same_ HDFS, then renaming the folder is fine.  As soon as you are doing any other kind of move (local -> HDFS, local -> S3, etc.) then the rename is an issue.  The problem really is that the rename is a hadoop filesystem call and what it does underneath is hidden from gobblin.  For instance, when the filesystem is HDFS then it can just rename the folder.  However, when the filesystem is S3, it needs to walk the directory tree and and upload each file individually.  \n\nReally, what is needed is different code paths for the different filesystems.  That way we could do an atomic folder copy for HDFS and update all WorkUnitStates when done.  For the S3 filesystem we could move the folder like I have done in this PR and update the WorkUnitStates while moving.  The problem with this approach is that it doesn't extend to new filesystems.  \n\nAlternatively, like you have suggested, we could add a flag to control whether we publish the folder as one atomic unit or walk the folder and upload the contents individually.  The issue with adding this flag is that if the S3 filesystem is used then the we basically require that the folder is uploaded by walking the structure. If this setting is missed or forgotten, then we cannot guarantee \"at least once\" semantics.\n\n_The method in this PR will work for all hadoop filesystems._ \n\nI understand your concern for performance, but can you quantify the performance hit this would cause?  Also, can you please specify the expected size of a folder that is being published so we have a common benchmark to use for comparison?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/171442039/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/171449810","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/572#issuecomment-171449810","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/572","id":171449810,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MTQ0OTgxMA==","user":{"login":"kadaan","id":1904898,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDQ4OTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1904898?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan","html_url":"https://github.com/kadaan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-13T21:57:27Z","updated_at":"2016-01-13T21:57:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@zliu41 @liyinan926 As this seems to be a pretty high priority issue, I'd like to see if we could hash out a solution in a more interactive method.
