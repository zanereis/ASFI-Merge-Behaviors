/ @gr4ve \r\n\r\nIndependent of where you get your class loader, you'll need to update to the latest version of Janino to be able to pass your intended class loader to get their default compiler factory.\r\n\r\nHere are my suggestions for updating to Janino. \r\n\r\nNote: there is still a bug in the Janino code that is not passing the class loader to load the factory class. I've left a [comment](https://github.com/janino-compiler/janino/issues/141#issuecomment-858078770) with the author to resolve the issue.\r\nhttps://github.com/janino-compiler/janino/issues/141#issuecomment-858078770\r\n\r\nSo, in the end, we'll need to update to version 3.1.5, assuming the fix is completed in that version.\r\n\r\n```\r\n .../apache/calcite/adapter/enumerable/EnumerableInterpretable.java   | 5 +++--\r\n .../main/java/org/apache/calcite/interpreter/JaninoRexCompiler.java  | 5 +++--\r\n

I can't tell whether these are real changes or just instability in the file format. If you can, preserve the file format. Generally \"planBefore\" should occur before \"planAfter\" (even though that is not alphabetical).\r\n\r\nThis is because I have homogenized several tests. Originally, some of the tests were checking \"manually\" a certain plan with some boilerplate code e.g.\r\n```\r\nRelNode output = hepPlanner.findBestExp();\r\nfinal String planAfter = NL + RelOptUtil.toString(output);\r\nfinal DiffRepository diffRepos = getDiffRepos();\r\ndiffRepos.assertEquals(\"planAfter\", \"${planAfter}\", planAfter);\r\nSqlToRelTestBase.assertValid(output);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis has been refactored to reuse `RelOptTestBase#Sql` methods:\r\n```\r\nrelFn(relFn).withRule(...).check();\r\n...\r\nrelFn(relFn).withRule(...).checkUnchanged();\r\n```\r\n- `check`: for the plans that must change when the rules are applied. They require `${planBefore}` and `${planAfter}`, and they must be different.\r\n- `checkUnchanged`: for the plans that must not change when rules are applied. They require only `${planBefore}` (which is used two times, before and after the rules application).\r\n\r\nOriginally, some tests were checking an unchanged plan by checking manually the after plan, and they only defined `${planAfter}` in the xml file. With the proposed homogenization, these tests are now using `checkUnchanged` (and the plan is defined as `${planBefore}`). \r\nAnalogously, some tests were checking a changed plan by manually checking the after plan, and they only defined `${planAfter}` in the xml file. These tests are now using `check`, and they define also their corresponding `${planBefore}` too.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, we can have tests (the unchanged ones) that define only `${planBefore}`; and tests (the changed ones) that defines  `${planBefore}` and `${planAfter}` (which must be different). I agree that the appropriate order for the latter is `${planBefore}` and then `${planAfter}`, I have tried to apply this convention; @julianhyde do you have any concrete example where this order is inversed in the patch?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/868976929/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/869418153","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/2443#issuecomment-869418153","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/2443","id":869418153,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2OTQxODE1Mw==","user":{"login":"chunweilei","id":37774589,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3Nzc0NTg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37774589?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chunweilei","html_url":"https://github.com/chunweilei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chunweilei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chunweilei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chunweilei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chunweilei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chunweilei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chunweilei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chunweilei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chunweilei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chunweilei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-28T07:07:38Z","updated_at":"2021-06-28T07:07:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The PR seems to have nothing to do with Calcite.

@vlsi @hsyuan @chunweilei,\r\nIt's been a while since I opened this PR. I do not have a reproducer anymore. The problem appeared in the private codebase in one of the TPC-DS tests with a certain set of rules and a concrete `derive/passThrough` logic. Since then there were multiple changes and I no longer can reproduce the error. I cannot prove that it was a real problem with a planner as opposed to a problem with my own logic.
