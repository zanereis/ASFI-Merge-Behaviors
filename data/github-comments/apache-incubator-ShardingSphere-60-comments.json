I hope the author can solve this bug as soon as possible, because I think it is a few bugs that are easy to reproduce. I and my friends around me say that it is a bug in sharding-jdbc. In fact, mycat also has such a bug, the reason is also because of the sorting problem, please refer to https://blog.csdn.net/u013235478/article/details/53178657 for details.\r\nHowever, I think there is a way to solve this problem. For example, first pass the total number of couns, then calculate the offset, and then rewrite sql. It can also solve the non-ID fragmentation, but sharding-jdbc does not. Provide such a function.\r\n\r\n```\r\n.....\r\n2019-08-04 15:13:31.387 [http-nio-8210-exec-9] INFO  ShardingSphere-SQL - Actual SQL: user_1 ::: SELECT\r\n        *\r\n        FROM t_user_97 as u\r\n        WHERE 1=1\r\n        AND insert_time  >=?\r\n         AND insert_time <=?\r\n        ORDER BY id desc\r\n            limit ? offset ? ::: [[2019-01-27T00:00:00.000+0800, 2019-08-04T23:59:59.000+0800, 852760, 0]]\r\n2019-08-04 15:13:31.387 [http-nio-8210-exec-9] INFO  ShardingSphere-SQL - Actual SQL: user_1 ::: SELECT\r\n        *\r\n        FROM t_user_98 as u\r\n        WHERE 1=1\r\n        AND insert_time  >=?\r\n         AND insert_time <=?\r\n        ORDER BY id desc\r\n            limit ? offset ? ::: [[2019-01-27T00:00:00.000+0800, 2019-08-04T23:59:59.000+0800, 852760, 0]]\r\n2019-08-04 15:13:31.387 [http-nio-8210-exec-9] INFO  ShardingSphere-SQL - Actual SQL: user_1 ::: SELECT\r\n       *\r\n        WHERE 1=1\r\n        AND insert_time  >=?\r\n         AND insert_time <=?\r\n        ORDER BY id desc\r\n            limit ? offset ? ::: [[2019-01-27T00:00:00.000+0800, 2019-08-04T23:59:59.000+0800, 852760, 0]]\r\n2019-08-04 15:13:31.387 [http-nio-8210-exec-9] INFO  ShardingSphere-SQL - Actual SQL: user_1 ::: SELECT\r\n        *\r\n        FROM t_user_100 as u\r\n        WHERE 1=1\r\n         AND insert_time  >=?\r\n         AND insert_time <=?\r\n        ORDER BY id desc\r\n            limit ? offset ? ::: [[2019-01-27T00:00:00.000+0800, 2019-08-04T23:59:59.000+0800, 852760, 0]]\r\nException in thread \"http-nio-8210-ClientPoller-1\" Exception in thread \"NettyClientWorkerThread_2\" Exception in thread \"recoverScheduler_QuartzSchedulerThread\" Exception in thread \"AsyncAppender-Dispatcher-Thread-25\" Exception in thread \"MQ-AsyncTraceDispatcher-Thread-be9e7518-bf87-4d9b-93f7-a42668e86cfc\" Exception in thread \"Catalina-utility-1\" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: GC overhead limit exceeded\r\n```\r\n\r\nOriginal sql\r\n\r\n```\r\n2019-08-04 15:13:31.387 [http-nio-8210-exec-1] DEBUG com.UserMapper.selectByExample - ==>  Preparing: select * from t_user WHERE 1=1 AND insert_time  >=?

I don't know the implementation of MyCat, but I think ShardingSphere don't have the problem.\r\n> \r\n> ShardingSphere provide ways to save memory. Please follow the instructions below to reduce the memory cost.\r\n> \r\n> 1. Make a stream ResultSet:\r\n>    **statement.setFetchSize(1);**\r\n>    or\r\n>    jdbc:postgresql://127.0.0.1:5432/demo?**defaultRowFetchSize=1**\r\n> 2. Make sure the ExecuteEngine in MEMORY_STRICTLY Mode:\r\n>    I noticed your SQL will be full routed to 200 nodes. (Everyone need to avoid full routing)\r\n>    Any way, set the props max.connections.size.per.query more than 200. For example:\r\n>    **max.connections.size.per.query: 300**\r\n> \r\n> After 1&2, both jdbc and ShardingSphere will not fetch all data in memory.\r\n> \r\n> For more details:\r\n> https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzUzNjgwODk2Mw==&mid=2247483679&idx=1&sn=ee7335b72b9105a53a55ee59b42358b1&chksm=faf1da73cd8653656b0c56ba852a98d67eb67f4f36e294a8c08507f5c3dc3b6897a90b99ea53&scene=0&key=4062b15c04f483fc1db8d4359b898767266e0bca63e1553ea724f2bf8a298d9cb0562f695b0804411c278e9e3db279cf63de75965c6f84781027c9ab8495334243939bbfc2f8ee21bacda90671addb29&ascene=1&uin=MTM1ODcxNDE1&devicetype=Windows+7&version=62060833&lang=zh_CN&pass_ticket=CdqzKWxf9iryvwQkRSxKqGt8Wz3LIqnQyhtmzMOC6eY%3D\r\n\r\n1. In fact, mycat also has this problem, the official is also recommended to use id query and then pagination, it is not recommended to directly page.\r\n2.Sharding-Proxy does not support postgresql\r\n3. Some more complicated queries, I think ShardingSphere has more advantages, because some queries I need to use stored procedures, I have written a set of business rules tool class, can directly get the specified data source directly from ShardingDataSource and then execute through JdbcTemplate .\r\n4. The answer you provided is not the same question that I am asking. The question I asked is ShardingSphere page sorting. Because the memory is too large, the memory leaks, and you send a ShardingSphere principle and optimization process.\r\n5. I have doubted whether the mqsql driver and the postgresql driver are inconsistent. It may be that mysql does not get all the data at once, and the postgresql driver may acquire all the data at a time, and then perform the memory and return, which leads to a one-time query. 8000000 data out of memory caused memory overflow, I tried to increase the java memory, and then did not crash, but when returned, the query is super slow, I spent more than 8 seconds from the beginning to the end of the data query, this is unacceptable If multiple concurrent calls will cause the same problem, memory overflows.\r\n6. Actually, I have thought about the solution.\r\n     First, it is preloading a number of data and then paging according to id.\r\n     Second, or synchronize the data to mongodb or ElasticSearch, but postgresql is not the same as mysql, can not directly resolve binlog, and the server is Alibaba Cloud, if using mq as compensation and frequently update the table data, resulting in business is extremely complicated , but also involves the order before and after, if the use of sequential messages involves the issue of fast consumption, of course, I can specify the channel.\r\n7. The service has been routed to the smallest possible table, but there are still more than 100 tables. I used multiple routes depending on the business.\r\n\r\n8. I have tried your configuration above, but this time it is a lot better, the system does not crash, but because the processing time is too long, the database timeout, if a large number of links, will drag the database.

Thanks for your reply.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I see Sharding JDBC as a layer over my datasource. I believe that since Sharding JDBC is actually a part of the application and not something in between the application and the database (like ProxySQL), Sharding JDBC is much more powerful as it can let me shard via an application logic as well and not only on basis of the SQL.\r\n\r\nAlso, I ll try to shed some light on my use case:\r\n\r\n- I have a multi-tenant application and we are sharding by tenant identifier. \r\n- Almost all requests served by the application are within the scope of the tenant.\r\n- Not all queries have the sharding column  (in my case, the tenant identifier). \r\n- If the query has sharding column, i will want to decide the target name as per that.\r\n- Otherwise, I will fetch tenant information from the current request being served by the application, and then decide target name from that \r\n\r\nI have a patch in my mind which should resolve this use case. If it will be ok, i can submit that as a pull request.
