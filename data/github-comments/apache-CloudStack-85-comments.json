thanks for the update, I will just call your attention to a few points:\n\nFirst of all, why did you open a new PR? I know you closed the other one, but IMHO it makes my job harder. The other PR had all of our conversions; you should have kept working there. It would be easier to track everything that was discussed if everything was at the same PR. Now please, keep with this one, no need to come back to the one you already closed or to open a new one after my suggestions.\n\nI noticed that you extract the code to a method as I suggested and created some test cases. You also add the “required = true” as Daan suggested; that is good.\n\nNow about the method “getVolumeNameFromCommand” you created. Please note that // is not the proper way to create a Java doc, please replace the // by the proper mark of Java docs\n\n```\n/** \n* this is a java doc\n**/\n\n/*\n*This is a block comment\n*/\n\n// this is a line comment\n```\n\nAbout the Java doc I would also encourage you to detail a little bit more the method such as:\n\n```\n/** \n* This method retrieves the volume name from the CreateVolumeCmd object.\n* If the method CreateVolumeCmd#getVolumeName() returns null, empty or blank, It will be generated a random name using getRandomVolumeName().\n**/\n```\n\nI do not know the proper notation of java doc to make reference to java classes and methods, so you will need to google it.\n\nNow about the tests, please remove those comments over method names. I believe they are not needed as the test method name is self-explained.\n\nAbout the “docs.js”, please improve the sentence you wrote.\nSomething like this would be better: 'Enter a unique volume name; if a name is not provided, a random name will be created'\n\nNow, I draw your attention again to the idea of sticking to the same PR were we started reviewing and chatting. If another reviewer comes to help with this new PR, she/he would not know about the blank case I told you in the other PR. The reviewer might even give a LGTM without even noticing that this PR is incomplete.\n\nHaving said that, could you add a test case to check the case in which users enter blank strings in the volume name? And of course, fix that in the code; otherwise, the test methods would not work.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/166987980/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/167040113","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1274#issuecomment-167040113","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1274","id":167040113,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NzA0MDExMw==","user":{"login":"anshul1886","id":1712815,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MTI4MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1712815?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886","html_url":"https://github.com/anshul1886","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-24T04:33:52Z","updated_at":"2015-12-24T04:33:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@pdube That part is handled elsewhere.
