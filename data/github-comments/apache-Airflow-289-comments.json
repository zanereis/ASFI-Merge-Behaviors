I really need a generic parser - without adding artificial markers in the code, where the structure is already there.\r\n\r\nI will need a few more places to parse yaml and such generic yaml parser for bash scripts will be super handy.\r\n\r\nIt has numerous advantages - most importantly it does not require any external tools to run. I am going to add also some BAT tests to automate most of the bash code that I wrote, so I think this might be better digestible if we have some tests around and they are running automatically. I will update the PR including tests for the parser so that we can also make sure the code is tested.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/571122332/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/571127225","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/7077#issuecomment-571127225","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/7077","id":571127225,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MTEyNzIyNQ==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-06T12:52:23Z","updated_at":"2020-01-06T12:55:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#

Many companies do not use Kerberos, but this option appears on the user screen. This can confuse new users because they don't know what Kerberos is and whether they should use it. However, if the company decides to use Kerberos, then the option is still available, and people should be aware of it.  We have win-win situations because new users can use Airflow more easily, and current users can still use this feature. In my opinion, we should not think of Airflow CLI as a utils application that performs one function, e.g. CURL. But as a complex application that is used in everyday work. Some users install Airflow locally and use CLI in their daily work. In the next step, they upload files to the production server. \r\n\r\nIn my opinion, we should split CLI into two parts:\r\n* one intended for normal users\r\n* one for administrators\r\n\r\nThe administrator would be able to run Kerberos. The user would not have this command. Unfortunately, it will be very difficult to do now, but...in the future, after we create the API, we can go back to this topic.

Many companies do not use Kerberos, but this option appears on the user screen. This can confuse new users because they don't know what Kerberos is and whether they should use it. However, if the company decides to use Kerberos, then the option is still available, and people should be aware of it. We have win-win situations because new users can use Airflow more easily, and current users can still use this feature. In my opinion, we should not think of Airflow CLI as a utils application that performs one function, e.g. CURL. But as a complex application that is used in everyday work. Some users install Airflow locally and use CLI in their daily work. In the next step, they upload files to the production server.\r\n> \r\n> In my opinion, we should split CLI into two parts:\r\n> \r\n> * one intended for normal users\r\n> * one for administrators\r\n> \r\n> The administrator would be able to run Kerberos. The user would not have this command. Unfortunately, it will be very difficult to do now, but...in the future, after we create the API, we can go back to this topic. Currently, this is the best way to improve the experience for a normal user\r\n\r\nI definitely don't have a strong opinion **against**  it :) but I just feel that there is no much to gain \r\nSo happy to get it merged if others agree.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/571239159/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/571242909","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/7070#issuecomment-571242909","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/7070","id":571242909,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MTI0MjkwOQ==","user":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-06T18:01:01Z","updated_at":"2020-01-06T18:02:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I think it's very rare thing to hide some command line options.

Our [pre-commits](\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/STATIC_CODE_CHECKS.rst#prerequisites-for-pre-commit-hooks)\nwill help you with that.\n- In case of a new feature add useful documentation (in docstrings or in `docs/` directory).\nAdding a new operator? Consider adding an example DAG that shows how users should use it.\n- Consider using [Breeze environment](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/BREEZE.rst) for testing\nlocally, it’s a heavy docker but it ships with a working Airflow and a lot of integrations.\n- Be patient and persistent. It might take some time to get a review or get the final approval from\nCommitters.\n\nApache Airflow is a community-driven project and together we are making it better 🚀.\n\nIn case of doubts contact the developers at:\nMailing List: dev@airflow.apache.org\nSlack: https://apache-airflow-slack.herokuapp.com/\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/571351950/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/571354709","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6948#issuecomment-571354709","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6948","id":571354709,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MTM1NDcwOQ==","user":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-06T23:05:09Z","updated_at":"2020-01-06T23:05:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"OK.

Our [pre-commits](\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/STATIC_CODE_CHECKS.rst#prerequisites-for-pre-commit-hooks)\nwill help you with that.\n- In case of a new feature add useful documentation (in docstrings or in `docs/` directory).\nAdding a new operator? Consider adding an example DAG that shows how users should use it.\n- Consider using [Breeze environment](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/BREEZE.rst) for testing\nlocally, it’s a heavy docker but it ships with a working Airflow and a lot of integrations.\n- Be patient and persistent. It might take some time to get a review or get the final approval from\nCommitters.\n\nApache Airflow is a community-driven project and together we are making it better 🚀.\n\nIn case of doubts contact
