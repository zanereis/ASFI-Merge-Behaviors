@tzulitai ! Thanks for testing also this. \r\n\r\nThe problem with the `CEP` failing test for `1.3` while passing for `1.2` is that the semantics of the `followedBy()` changed between `1.2` and `1.3`, so the expected results cannot be the same. \r\n\r\nIn `1.2`, `followedBy()` implied non-deterministic relaxed contiguity while in `1.3` it is just relaxed contiguity. So for `1.3`, either change the expected result to contain only one match with the `foo1` as middle element, or change the pattern to have `followedByAny(middle)` (and in this case you have to take the savepoint again).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/306482352/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/306493108","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4059#issuecomment-306493108","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4059","id":306493108,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNjQ5MzEwOA==","user":{"login":"tzulitai","id":5284370,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODQzNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5284370?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai","html_url":"https://github.com/tzulitai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-06T13:53:38Z","updated_at":"2017-06-06T13:53:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @kl0u, your suggestions fixes the problem.
