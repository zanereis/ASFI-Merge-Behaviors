I have reproduced the issue by making a change to one of the templates, then touching with a date far in the back. After that gets cached, the browser won't fetch the new version when I go to the affected page just by hitting enter in the URL bar. On refresh it does reload (this is for Chrome specifically). </p>\n\n<p>After thinking about it more, I think having a getStatic method that adds the url query param is the way to go, instead of setting the option globally.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612915112/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/224645572","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1451#issuecomment-224645572","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1451","id":224645572,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNDY0NTU3Mg==","user":{"login":"harshach","id":38649,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NjQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38649?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach","html_url":"https://github.com/harshach","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-08T16:22:42Z","updated_at":"2016-06-08T16:22:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @priyank5485 .
