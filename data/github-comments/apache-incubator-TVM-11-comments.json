to use dlpack conversions from pytorch, you can simply do the following instead of calling the torch C Module.\r\n```\r\nfrom torch.utils.dlpack import from_dlpack, to_dlpack\r\na = to_dlpack(tensor)\r\nb = from_dlpack(a)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI guess, we can easily add the python function call in pytorch that @tqchen suggested.

This function is not prefixed with the EXPORT macro, but is added to the global registry as \"_StageSplitByFactor\". What would be the preferred way of accessing this and similar functions? Should I add the EXPORT macro and use it directly, or go via the registry?\r\n\r\nThis affects other functions too such as ScheduleNode::make (depended on by create_schedule), and Schedule::operator[].

I guess we need to make a similar change for CanonicalSimplify as well. Is that correct?\r\nHere is my understanding: Some ops are defined in HalideIR and some in TVM. In particular, `Reduce` is in the latter. Moreover, Simplify is part of HalideIR, and therefore, can be applied only on expressions that have only HalideIR ops. And CanonicalSimplify can be applied on TVM expressions (which can include any TVM-specific or HalideIR ops). To simplify an expression that has a `Reduce` op at the top, we can only apply CanonicalSimplify on it (while passing range information to resolve original problem).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/346467845/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/346517925","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/629#issuecomment-346517925","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/629","id":346517925,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NjUxNzkyNQ==","user":{"login":"Huyuwei","id":17470319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDcwMzE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17470319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei","html_url":"https://github.com/Huyuwei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-23T02:06:28Z","updated_at":"2017-11-23T02:06:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ok, within this week.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/346517925/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/346537657","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/664#issuecomment-346537657","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/664","id":346537657,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NjUzNzY1Nw==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-23T06:07:22Z","updated_at":"2017-11-23T06:07:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"It is already available.

The second challenge is to build the dsl representation to cover things we care about in deep learning(e.g. recurrence). The other issues include the ease of deployment and interpolation.\r\n\r\nThese challenges are not well addressed by existing frameworks(including Halide) and requires rethink and design of the stack

The same has already been done for `update` part.\r\nThe other issue is whether `ldw` should also be bound to 1024 or not, for `fill_zero`. Note that `ldw` is a parameter of `Wb` buffer (associated with tensor `w`) and not tensor `z` which are filling with zeros in the intrinsic. We either need to do the binding or emit an error message. The binding in this case happens in StorageFlatten where the buffer is bound to the tensor. Currently, since `fill_zero`  has only `z` as its AttrStmt and `ldw` is associated with `w` (and not `z`), `ldw` doesn't get bound.
