are a few more notes from my tests while they're still fresh in my mind.\r\n\r\n### Proxy connection reuse\r\n\r\nThe connection counts in the set of tables in my prior comment above are from the perspective of the `ConfigureProxy` class, obtained from Ant debug log messages. Yet multiple `ConfigureProxy` connections can be carried by a single persistent *keep-alive* proxy connection.\r\n\r\nThe tables below, on the other hand, show the counts of actual connections made through the proxy server to an external host, obtained directly from the access log of the Squid proxy server. The proxy access logs for each of the six tests below are available in the following archive:\r\n\r\n[squid-access-logs.tar.gz](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/files/8894676/squid-access-logs.tar.gz) - Squid access logs for the tables below\r\n\r\n#### BEFORE\r\n\r\nThe table below lists the number of connection made through the proxy server to each external host before the changes in this pull request. The columns contain the connection counts when `http_proxy` is set, when `https_proxy` is set, and when both environment variables are set.\r\n\r\n| Proxy Connections       | *http_proxy* | *https_proxy* | Both Variables |\r\n|-------------------------|-------------:|--------------:|---------------:|\r\n| gitbox.apache.org       |            2 |             2 |              3 |\r\n| netbeans.osuosl.org     |           11 |            22 |            109 |\r\n| services.gradle.org     |            1 |             1 |              2 |\r\n| downloads.gradle-dn.com |            1 |             1 |              1 |\r\n| repo.gradle.org         |            1 |             1 |              2 |\r\n| repo1.maven.org         |            1 |            20 |            468 |\r\n| **Total connections**   |       **17** |        **47** |        **585** |\r\n| Unused connections      |       *none* |        *none* |        **546** |\r\n\r\n#### AFTER\r\n\r\nThe table below lists the same information after the changes in this pull request.\r\n\r\n| Proxy Connections       | *http_proxy* | *https_proxy* | Both Variables |\r\n|-------------------------|-------------:|--------------:|---------------:|\r\n| gitbox.apache.org       |            2 |             2 |              2 |\r\n| netbeans.osuosl.org     |           11 |            11 |             11 |\r\n| services.gradle.org     |            1 |             1 |              1 |\r\n| downloads.gradle-dn.com |            1 |             1 |              1 |\r\n| repo.gradle.org         |            1 |             1 |              1 |\r\n| repo1.maven.org         |            1 |             1 |              1 |\r\n| **Total connections**   |       **17** |        **17** |         **17** |\r\n| Unused connections      |       *none* |        *none* |         *none* |\r\n\r\nNotice that there's a large reduction in the number of proxy connections made, and no excess unused connections are made at all. I suspect that the single thread used in the pull request is allowing the Java runtime to reuse the *keep-alive* proxy connections, keeping them to a minimum.\r\n\r\nMaking the requests sequential through the proxy *keep-alive* connections, though, does not affect the build time:\r\n\r\n| Build Time      | *http_proxy* | *https_proxy* | Both Variables |\r\n|-----------------|-------------:|--------------:|---------------:|\r\n| Before this PR  |      10m 42s |        9m 39s |         9m 33s |\r\n| After this PR   |       9m 36s |        9m 43s |         9m  5s |\r\n\r\n### A partial workaround\r\n\r\nThe first table above suggests a workaround for the original problem of the build failing when both environment variables are set. The build fails because the external host tells it to back off on the excess connections by sending a response of \"503 Service Unavailable.\"\r\n\r\nThe workaround is to remove one of the proxy variables from the environment before starting the build:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nunset https_proxy\r\nant -Dmetabuild.branch=master\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's only a partial workaround because:\r\n\r\n* the build still tries to make direct connections even when it's told to use a proxy server, and\r\n* the build might not take full advantage of the HTTP 1.1 *keep-alive* connections because up to three different threads are used to open connections through the proxy server.\r\n\r\n### Frequency of failures\r\n\r\nNow that I have a workaround, I expect the original problem to be rare. The screenshot below shows that the NetBeans builds on Launchpad almost always failed over the past six months:\r\n\r\n![latest-builds](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1413266/173450229-e915a0ee-d5d8-4df2-9031-8e5f8c879a8e.png)\r\n\r\nFor future searches, the error messages in the build logs are illustrated by the following two samples:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[downloadbinaries] Could not download ...\r\n  ...\r\njava.io.IOException: Skipping download from\r\n

I'll check later maybe I was wrong.\r\n\r\n> Do you have both Gnome and KDE installed on your system? Perhaps JDK is picking up settings from another installed window manager. Or it might be a fontconfig thing...\r\n\r\nNo, just KDE Plasma. X11 or Wayland (NetBeans through XWayland) both worked fine.\r\n\r\n> If Xft.rgba has a useful value, we could use that, though, as you suggest. Could you run the following, and let us know the output?\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> command xrdb -query 2> /dev/null | grep Xft.rgba\r\n> ```\r\n\r\n```\r\nXft.rgba:       rgb\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1158757828/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1158773795","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/4228#issuecomment-1158773795","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4228","id":1158773795,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5FEXwj","user":{"login":"NickLion","id":744015,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NDAxNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/744015?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NickLion","html_url":"https://github.com/NickLion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NickLion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NickLion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NickLion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NickLion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NickLion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NickLion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NickLion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NickLion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NickLion/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-17T11:21:22Z","updated_at":"2022-06-17T11:37:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"If there is issue for some people with KDE + OpenJDK, maybe something like this would be fine:\r\n\r\n```\r\n            case $(command xrdb -query 2> /dev/null | grep Xft.rgba | cut -d ':' -f2 | xargs) in\r\n                rgb)\r\n                    extra_automatic_options=\"-J-Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=lcd\"\r\n                    ;;\r\n                bgr)\r\n                    extra_automatic_options=\"-J-Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=lcd_hbgr\"\r\n                    ;;\r\n                vrgb)\r\n                    extra_automatic_options=\"-J-Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=lcd_vrgb\"\r\n                    ;;\r\n                vbgr)\r\n                    extra_automatic_options=\"-J-Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=lcd_vbgr\"\r\n                    ;;\r\n                *)\r\n                    extra_automatic_options=\"-J-Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=on\"\r\n                    ;;\r\n            esac\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1158773795/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1158853426","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/4228#issuecomment-1158853426","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4228","id":1158853426,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5FErMy","user":{"login":"eirikbakke","id":886243,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NjI0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/886243?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke","html_url":"https://github.com/eirikbakke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-17T13:07:14Z","updated_at":"2022-06-17T13:07:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@NickLion Yes, the proposed case statement based on Xft.rgba is a great idea, inserted in the KDE_FULL_SESSION case.
