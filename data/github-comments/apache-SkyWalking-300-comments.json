Each RPC/MQ has different parameters, so we need a general way to provide abstract APIs.\r\n\r\nI think about how to provide the abstract APIs for injecting/capturing data processed by `ContextCarrier` to/from all kinds of messages. In my opinion, the core part code is as below statements.\r\n```java\r\n// in asynchttpclient-2.x-plugin\r\nfinal HttpHeaders headers = httpRequest.getHeaders();\r\nCarrierItem next = contextCarrier.items();\r\nwhile (next.hasNext()) {\r\n    next = next.next();\r\n    headers.set(next.getHeadKey(), next.getHeadValue());\r\n}\r\n```\r\nOriginally, I want to implement this part code of RPC/MQ inside the `inject` and `extract` toolkit-api. But now, as you say, each RPC/MQ has different parameters, so I think maybe exposing the `items()` in `ContextCarrier`, `hasNext()` and  `next()` in `CarrierItem` as the \"Ref\" format is better. So users can use these APIs freely to pass data by all kinds of messages such as HTTP headers, RPC metadata and so on. I'm not sure it's a reasonable idea.

So let me elaborate a little:\r\n\r\nWe have a springboot based base-alpine image,\r\n\r\nwhere our internal javaagent and the skywalking javaagent are both incorporated.

So, to delete the javaagent on the base image will mean modifying close to 400 app helm charts which would be a long-drawn and company-wide impacting change, which might never get a green light.\r\n\r\nSo, adding that flag would be targetting only one helm chart at a time, also, some of these apps may never want to move into SW, sometimes they want to move in or out.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/1378265734/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/1378273410","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/10265#issuecomment-1378273410","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/10265","id":1378273410,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArmls85SJsiC","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-11T05:55:42Z","updated_at":"2023-01-11T05:55:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"OK.

have tested many ways, I'm sorry to say that for the current performance, it is difficult to meet APM's parsing needs for sql.\r\n\r\nI've thought about optimizing performance by simplifying parser rules, skipping unneeded parts, and using antlr4 actions. But there is no order of magnitude improvement. \r\n\r\nThis is the performance report of my parser :  [performance report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VlZv5yn43DCZWKMj-laQ3ftTyJDe8dQyggSFN8aiLY4/edit)\r\n\r\nThis is the design report of sql-sign: [sql-sign](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vcLNsT0OqJ-5CUfhi82-cEokSFQpe8sPyPxi85tGR1U/edit#heading=h.ce29jil1ejod)\r\n\r\nThis is the repository of my parser: [sql-parser](https://github.com/yswdqz/sqlparser) \r\nNotice: it has 2 modes: with action and with visitor. With action mode can parse most dml statement. But visitor mode I only implement select and delete statement (because of after finish these, I already found that the problem of performance, so I have not completed it)\r\n\r\nTo test them in APM , we can use [test file](https://github.com/yswdqz/sqlparser/blob/main/test/RealSegmentTest.java). It should be put in `server-starter` module's test folder. And change `VirtualDatabaseProcessor#prepareVSIfNecessary` as [VirtualDatabaseProcessor.java](https://github.com/yswdqz/sqlparser/blob/main/test/VirtualDatabaseProcessor.java) . Then you can run benchmark to test the performance changes before and after code changes.\r\n\r\nFinally, as mentioned in the performance report, The main performance problems are in the lexer analysis and parser analysis \r\n sections. So it's likely that future performance improvements will be in the parser and lexer. It might be a good idea not to use antlr4 (or other util) to implement the parser, but that would be too much work. In the future I will focus on solutions from other open source frameworks and try to solve this performance problem.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/1383703791/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/1383744243","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/9661#issuecomment-1383744243","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/9661","id":1383744243,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArmls85SekLz","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-16T09:31:46Z","updated_at":"2023-01-16T09:31:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for your summary. \nLet's suspend from here, until we have a better way, which costs a reasonable resources for analyzing this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/1383744243/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/1383757037","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/9883#issuecomment-1383757037","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/9883","id":1383757037,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArmls85SenTt","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-16T09:39:11Z","updated_at":"2023-01-16T09:39:11Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@pg-yang, @yswdqz told me, he has interests to follow this too.\nI think you could share what you have about workflow, data formats and important docs here.\nAnd mostly, your next PR(aw-otel-receiver) would be widely used.

[Amazon CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/WhatIsCloudWatch.html) could collect metrics from most AWS services(e.g. S3, API Gateway). \r\n2. [CloudWatch metrics stream ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Metric-Streams.html) is a feature of CloudWatch, it could stream CloudWatch metrics to a destination of your choice.  Actually by my test, the only option of destination is [Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/what-is-this-service.html)\r\n3. [Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/what-is-this-service.html) could send data to HTTP endpoint(refer to [Choose HTTP Endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/create-destination.html#create-destination-http)), and the HTTP endpoint should follow[ the specification](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/httpdeliveryrequestresponse.html)\r\n\r\nSo we could develop a module(let's name it ` aws-firehose-receiver ` temporarily). ` aws-firehose-receiver ` will follow [ the specification](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/httpdeliveryrequestresponse.html) to receive HTTP request from [Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/what-is-this-service.html), and convert the HTTP request to OTLP request, and then invoke `org.apache.skywalking.oap.server.receiver.otel.otlp.OpenTelemetryMetricHandler#export` for reusing code in  `otel-receiver-plugin`. \r\n\r\nHere is the data flow of S3(others are similar)\r\n\r\n```mermaid\r\ngraph LR;\r\nS3 --> CloudWatch --> CloudWatch-stream --> Amazon-Kinesis-Data-Firehose  -->  aws-firehose-receiver --> OpenTelemetryMetricHandler\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is some doc maybe you want to read \r\n\r\n1. [CloudWatch Metric Streams ‚Äì Send AWS Metrics to Partners and to Your Apps in Real Time](https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/aws/cloudwatch-metric-streams-send-aws-metrics-to-partners-and-to-your-apps-in-real-time/)\r\n2. [S3 metrics with Cloud Watch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/cloudwatch-monitoring.html)\r\n3. [API Gateway metrics with Cloud Watch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-metrics.html)\r\n4. [DynamoDB metrics with Cloud Watch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/monitoring-cloudwatch.html)\r\n\r\nHere is S3 metrics sample data in JSON
