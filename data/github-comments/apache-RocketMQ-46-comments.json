Notice, it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR.\r\nMake sure there is a Github issue filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\nFormat the pull request title like [ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\nWrite a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\nWrite necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in test module.\r\nRun mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle to make sure basic checks pass. Run mvn clean install -DskipITs to make sure unit-test pass. Run mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test to make sure integration-test pass.\r\nIf this contribution is large, please file an Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can view, comment on, or merge this pull request online at:\r\n  https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/1734\r\nCommit Summary\r\nfix RequestCallback executed multi
