Hostmanager\n# wants to update the /etc/hosts entries, but tries to do so even on nodes that\n# aren't up (e.g. even when all nodes are stopped and you run vagrant\n# destroy). Because of the way the underlying code in vagrant works, it still\n# tries to communicate with the node and has to wait for a very long\n# timeout. This modifies the update to check for hosts that are not created or\n# stopped, skipping the update in that case since it's impossible to update\n# nodes in that state.\n```\n\nAlthough understanding all that might require knowing more about the Vagrant setup -- hostmanager is a plugin that fills in /etc/hosts with info for other nodes so you can use convenient names like `worker1` rather than IP addresses.\n\nUnfortunately, this was the way I could hack around the bad interaction w/ vagrant-aws, but is also quite brittle. You might want to check the versions of your vagrant plugins. I think we specify ranges of versions that will work in the README, and there's a bootstrapping script that should also ensure you have the right versions.\n\nThe annoying complexity of the Vagrantfile combined with the fact that most Vagrant stuff does not parallelize well makes me wonder if we should move some of the responsibility for handling these steps over to the ducktape VagrantCluster class, but I also don't want to end up reimplementing significant chunks of Vagrant's existing functionality...\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/158274385/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/158282172","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/566#issuecomment-158282172","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/566","id":158282172,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1ODI4MjE3Mg==","user":{"login":"ewencp","id":47366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp","html_url":"https://github.com/ewencp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-20T05:20:58Z","updated_at":"2015-11-20T05:20:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@gwenshap This is a blocker, also should be a quick review.

The problem actually has nothing to do with protocol. It's to do with the upgrade to the new consumer. I'm not yet clear exactly why this happens but basically the verifiable producer becomes overwhelmed and goes offline for up to a couple of minutes.
