PipelineOptions in each IO:\r\nPros: no additional benefits that I know (you may have some ideas on this from your experience on other apache projects - please let me know! Remember that we'd still want to do shared test runs)\r\nCons: \r\n* options on the command line but not present in the PipelineOptions being used to read them will cause an error (we could in theory remove this error)\r\n* encourages code copying/different command line options even when using the same data store (eg what happens with elasticsearchio and hifio's elasticsearch)\r\n\r\n\r\nShared Big PipelineOptions: \r\npros/cons are the inverse of the last.\r\n\r\n>This module will also contain the Kubernetes scripts, right ?\r\n\r\ncorrect. \r\n\r\n> If later, we go in a way where we will do individual release of each IO, this approach could be painful.\r\n\r\nCan you explain that a bit more? I'm guessing you're referring to the idea that the individual IOs would all need to share the common-io-it. It seems like in that world they could still share a test jar. Is that bad?
