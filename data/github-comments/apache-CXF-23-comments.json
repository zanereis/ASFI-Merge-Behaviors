I won't notify you again about this release, but will get in touch when a new version is available. If you'd rather skip all updates until the next major or minor version, let me know by commenting `@dependabot ignore this major version` or `@dependabot ignore this minor version`. You can also ignore all major, minor, or patch releases for a dependency by adding an [`ignore` condition](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/configuration-options-for-dependency-updates#ignore) with the desired `update_types` to your config file.\n\nIf you change
