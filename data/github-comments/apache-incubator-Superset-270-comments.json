The basic idea is this:\r\n> \r\n> 1. AND across different keys\r\n> 2. OR within keys\r\n> 3. apply default if user doesn't belong to any roles within a certain key\r\n> \r\n> In my example, the following WHERE clauses would be generated:\r\n> \r\n> 1. doesn't belong to any groups: `((false)) AND ((report_date >= current_timestamp() - 1))`\r\n> 2. belongs to \"finance\": `((dept_id = 1)) AND ((report_date >= current_timestamp() - 30))`\r\n> 3. belongs to \"risk\": `((dept_id = 2)) AND ((report_date >= current_timestamp() - 1))`\r\n> 4. belongs to \"finance\" and \"risk\": `((dept_id = 1) OR (dept_id = 2)) AND ((report_date >= current_timestamp() - 30))`\r\n> \r\n> For your example case, providing that these filter groups were made with the same key (as I understand they should), the following WHERE clause would be generated: `((country='Freedonia' AND item='Apples') OR (country='Ruritania' AND item='Oranges'))`, i.e. the user would _not_ see Ruritania Apple exports.\r\n> \r\n> In the case of having a default duration of 30 days and specifying a more restrictive filter group for 1 day, the default would not be applied, i.e. the user would only see one day's worth of data. Of course, if the user belonged to _two_ restrictive groups, 15 days and 1 days, the more permissive role of 15 days would in practice apply. However, this seems like a logical error in how the roles are assigned to users.\r\n> \r\n> The proposal to start by rolling out the backend functionality was merely a proposal to keep the PRs as small as possible and easier to review/develop. However, I'm sure they can be done together, assuming the person working on the PR is proficient in both the frontend and backend aspects of the codebase.\r\n\r\nI think that I'm following. So in your framework, my example would look something like:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"somekey\": {\r\n    \"default\": \"false\",\r\n    \"roles\": {\r\n      \"freedonia-orchards\": \"country='Freedonia' AND item='Apples'\",\r\n      \"ruritania-groves\": \"country='Ruritania' AND item='Oranges'\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI believe that functionally this is very similar to the current PR, with the following difference:\r\n- In the current PR, combinations of roles must be created as new roles and the filter clauses explicitly defined\r\n- In your proposed setup the logic for how the clauses within roles should be combined is explicitly defined by the user at the time of creation in the AND/OR hierarchy of the JSON structure\r\n\r\nIs that accurate? How would you envision making this available to end-users in the UI?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/561441223/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/561441393","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/8745#issuecomment-561441393","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/8745","id":561441393,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MTQ0MTM5Mw==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-04T02:03:00Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T02:03:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8745?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> :exclamation: No coverage uploaded for pull request base (`master@5e1a6ea`).

I refined my original proposal somewhat, and concluded that the default value should be present in the OR clause. For instance, if you would want to give access to everyone for pear sales in Megalomania, the key-value pair `\"default\": \"country='Megalomania' AND item='Pears'\"` should be present under `\"somekey\"` to ensure users in the `ruritania-groves` Role aren't left out.\r\n\r\nMy main motivation here is to ensure we can construct arbitrarily complex role based filters, and after this last amendment I believe this is pretty solid. So the basic premise is:\r\n- Default value for key -> what everyone should see\r\n- Additional keys -> increased security\r\n- Additional roles within a key -> relaxed security,\r\n\r\nwhich I feel should be a pretty good trade-off between complexity and versatility.\r\n\r\n@mistercrunch @dpgaspar do you feel this should be done using the FAB model, or as a column under table? I was thinking one could create a React component for editing the groups/roles, that in turn leverages the existing `AdhocFilterEditPopover` React component.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/561715469/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/561730962","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/8756#issuecomment-561730962","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/8756","id":561730962,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MTczMDk2Mg==","user":{"login":"issue-label-bot[bot]","id":48611044,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDg2MTEwNDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/27079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/issue-label-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-04T16:46:56Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T16:46:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Issue-Label Bot is automatically applying the label `#bug` to this issue, with a confidence of 0.89.

I think quickly things become better handled based on data over metadata. By that I mean if there are complex rules over which sales rep can see which regions, or even just if there's a high-ish cardinality of rules (say over 10), things are best represented as a subquery based on local data.\r\n\r\nThat's easily expressed as something like `region IN (SELECT region FROM rules_table WHERE user_id = {{current_user.id}})`. Then a single rule will do and it becomes about managing the `rules_table`.\r\n\r\nI'm not against a more structured format as in (field, operator, value), as long as value is templatable and operator has a subquery option. It does seem logic to go logical `AND` across fields and logical `OR` (or `IN`) on same field.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/561868273/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/561868871","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/8733#issuecomment-561868871","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/8733","id":561868871,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MTg2ODg3MQ==","user":{"login":"robdiciuccio","id":296227,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjIyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/296227?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robdiciuccio","html_url":"https://github.com/robdiciuccio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robdiciuccio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robdiciuccio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robdiciuccio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robdiciuccio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robdiciuccio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robdiciuccio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robdiciuccio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robdiciuccio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robdiciuccio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-04T22:29:03Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T22:29:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"One last issue with `datetime` timezone support to address.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/561868871/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/561871911","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/8758#issuecomment-561871911","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/8758","id":561871911,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MTg3MTkxMQ==","user":{"login":"issue-label-bot[bot]","id":48611044,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDg2MTEwNDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/27079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/issue-label-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-04T22:37:46Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T22:37:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Issue-Label Bot is automatically applying the label `#enhancement` to this issue, with a confidence of 0.83.
