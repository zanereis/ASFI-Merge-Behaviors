I have configured the defaultDataSource now, but the tables that do not need to be sharded will still be parsed by ShardingSphere, which results in slow first parsing\r\n\r\nHi @xfyang1988 \r\nOnly by parsing this SQL it is possible for ShardingSphere to know your table is a sharding table or not. Therefore, SQL parsing is necessary. Actually, parsed SQL will be cached for the next request, which will help weaken parsing's side effects.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nTrista","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/692437599/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/692444448","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/7419#issuecomment-692444448","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/7419","id":692444448,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5MjQ0NDQ0OA==","user":{"login":"tristaZero","id":27757146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NzU3MTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27757146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero","html_url":"https://github.com/tristaZero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-15T03:43:34Z","updated_at":"2020-09-15T03:43:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> It might reach its capacity.
