The \"resolved\" status for the mentioned JDK bug is from 2005, but the workaround that is removed in this PR dates back to 2014.

It seems to be to do with an implicit `final` modifier. The code is currently making sure there's a space between that and the type, even if it's not in the source.  Try an explicit `final` and you won't see the problem. I assume that at some point the compiler API started reporting the source positions of that element differently.\r\n\r\nThe removed line breaks may also be due to changes in the reported token positions, but I'm stuck on that one at the moment.

Copying a string in NetBeans does appear to _clear_ contents of the clipboard that was created by Notepad, however.\r\n* Copy/paste between other Windows applications (not NetBeans) still appears to be working.\r\n* Other apps running at the time the bug was observed: Adobe Acrobat Professional, Microsoft Excel, jEdit on Java 10.0.2 (different JDK than NetBeans), Windows Command Prompt, Chrome, WSL Ubuntu, Windows Explorer, a production and development version of a NetBeans Platform application (on Java 17.0.3), Microsoft Outlook.\r\n\r\nNext, I'll start using netbeans.slow.system.clipboard.hack=false in my working IDE and see if the bug still appears at some point.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1254029378/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1254035095","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/4651#issuecomment-1254035095","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4651","id":1254035095,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5Kvw6X","user":{"login":"errael","id":20450427,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDUwNDI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20450427?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/errael","html_url":"https://github.com/errael","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/errael/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/errael/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/errael/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/errael/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/errael/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/errael/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/errael/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/errael/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/errael/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-21T17:50:31Z","updated_at":"2022-09-21T17:50:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"So
