I am very interested in this feature from `JSS`:\r\n\r\n> JSS is a framework-agnostic CSS-in-JS library with which you can dynamically generate CSS styles based on the state of your components. \r\n\r\nI had a small feature already in the dashboard code that can be much cleaner if i had help from a css-in-JS framework:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/291306392443a5a0d0e2ee0cc4a95d37c56d4589/superset-frontend/src/dashboard/components/gridComponents/ChartHolder.jsx#L72\r\nIn the above code, when user click on filter indicator on a chart, I want to show an animation on a dropdown in the filter_box that contains the user interested field. Without css-in-js, I need to pass props between nested React components which is kind of very troublesome (and cause many unnecessary rerendering).\r\n\r\nCan Emotion handle this case easily? I am new to all css-in-js libraries. Once we decided, i'd like to re-write this module to use our pick.

What software architecture will you choose?\r\n1. What is your opinion of [the Clean architecture](https://pusher.com/tutorials/clean-architecture-introduction)\r\n\r\n> There are a number of modules that have grown organically over time to truly massive size. Often these modules contain utility functions, classes of multiple types, and a broad array of other functionality. These modules are very hard to work with.\r\n\r\n1. How do you plan to analyze this problem? Will you create a single mother ticket and a number of child tickets for each issue?\r\n1. How will you refactor all the tests in the current code base?\r\n\r\n> Business logic is frequently intermixed with display logic, making code reuse more difficult.\r\n\r\n1. Do you have specific examples of this problem?\r\n1. Isn't there a business reason for everything you display? how easy is it to separate the two?\r\n1. do you have a code reviewer? if so, who let these problems get into the codebase in the first place?\r\n\r\n> Circular dependency issues crop up regularly with the existing module design\r\n\r\nWould [Inversion of control or dependency injection](https://github.com/metaperl/python-oop/wiki/Dependency-Injection) help with this? If not, what will help with it?\r\n\r\n> Many modules have implicit dependencies on other modules which requires a specific load order\r\n\r\nThis does not seem like much of a problem to me. Except that PyCharm (and other tools) run a module-reorder as part of their automatic code cleanup and this might prohibit something from loading.\r\n\r\n> There’s a substantial amount of app-specific code in shared modules\r\n\r\nI do not understand the problem: Are you saying there is **code duplication**? If the purpose of a module is to do something for the app, then it stands to reason it would have app-specific code, wouldnt it? I'm confused.\r\n\r\n> In some instances, particularly where there is pre-existing inheritance in Flask-AppBuilder, the inheritance chain can be over 10 classes deep. This can make understanding some classes very challenging.\r\n\r\nIt can be challenging, but IMHO the code is well-written. I had to trace throgh 7 levels of OO inheritance here: https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/8695#issuecomment-559968158\r\n\r\nI would be curious to see how you would improve things and whether the problems is rooted in Flask itself and FAB and Superset have no choice but to bow to their Creator.\r\n\r\n> Organize modules function and back-end objects rather than products\r\n\r\nthis phrase does not express a complete thought. I think there is some sort of grammatical error here. I have no idea what you are suggesting.\r\n\r\n> Avoid: SQL Lab, Explore\r\n\r\nOne of these is a noun/product just like the things you prefer. The other is a verb.... What is unacceptable about SQL Lab?\r\n\r\n> class DashboardDAO(DataAccessObject):  def find_for_update(actor, dashboard_id): \r\n\r\nWhy is this preferred over a find_for_update in the class that `actor` belongs to? ditto for \r\n`class DashboardDAO(DataAccessObject):  def update(dashboard, dashboard_params):` - this looks like a method that belongs to the Dashboard class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/586375971/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":1,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/586376328","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/9077#issuecomment-586376328","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/9077","id":586376328,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NjM3NjMyOA==","user":{"login":"DiggidyDave","id":1179026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkwMjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DiggidyDave","html_url":"https://github.com/DiggidyDave","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DiggidyDave/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DiggidyDave/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DiggidyDave/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DiggidyDave/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DiggidyDave/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DiggidyDave/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DiggidyDave/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DiggidyDave/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DiggidyDave/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-14T17:00:04Z","updated_at":"2020-02-14T17:00:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The empty `__init__.py` files alone would provide enormous value IMO.

I appreciate the community taking the issue seriously.\r\n\r\n@DiggidyDave I agree that empty `__init__.py` files will help substantially. @dpgaspar has a PR open right now that's linked to this issue that demonstrates the patterns we're suggesting. IMHO the result is very readable and easy to work with. We hope for this SIP to be a North Star that we gradually work towards. I like your suggestion of implementing valuable bits in chunks. I'd recommend being pragmatic and attacking small enough pieces that they are comprehensible. One of the areas I'm most excited to tackle is slimming down the model layer using DAOs and commands - I think models are far too thick at the moment, but I would treat this work alone as multiple coherent changes rather than one large PR due to the potential complexity involved.\r\n\r\n@john-bodley Superset currently has examples of both the Command pattern and a pattern similar to DAOs. Alembic's individual migration classes are an example of a command and FAB's shared filters are very similar to a DAO, in that they encapsulate shared query logic outside of the model. A DAO allows us to extract query logic from model classes to a clear destination. As we refactor, we need a target to move towards. Blueprints separate functionality well at the API layer, but will not provide a clean abstraction at the model or business logic layer without a few other patterns to lean on. I agree that fully refactoring the code is a large unit of work and expect this to be a target we move towards gradually where it makes sense. Currently the model layer is very thick and we have a lot of business logic in endpoint code. To me this is a difficult problem to solve without a shared concept of where this code should go moving forward and a pattern to leverage.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/586414197/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/586429496","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/9077#issuecomment-586429496","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/9077","id":586429496,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NjQyOTQ5Ng==","user":{"login":"suddjian","id":1858430,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTg0MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1858430?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddjian","html_url":"https://github.com/suddjian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddjian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddjian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddjian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddjian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddjian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddjian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddjian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddjian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddjian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-14T19:14:05Z","updated_at":"2020-02-14T19:14:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@metaperl \r\n\r\n> who let these problems get into the codebase in the first place?\r\n\r\nDisorganization is a result of many people independently contributing to a project, focusing on shipping functional code quickly. This has worked well for Superset, but has resulted in a fair amount of tech debt. This SIP is about putting some structure in place that can help with future efforts. Blaming committers for these issues is not helpful or appropriate.\r\n\r\n> I have no idea what you are suggesting.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that backend code should be focused on the entities being acted on, rather than the specific part of Superset that is interacting with that entity. For example, SQL Lab and Explore (\"products\") interact with Datasources, Queries, Users (\"objects\"). This is proposing that the backend should be focused on providing APIs that are object-centric (`POST /datasources`, `GET /queries`, rather than APIs that are specific to any one product within Superset.\r\n\r\n> IMHO the code is well-written. I had to trace throgh 7 levels of OO inheritance\r\n\r\nI would argue that you should not have to delve through 7 levels of inheritance to understand what a piece of code is doing.

I really like that different modules have their independent folders and we are introducing conventions and increasing consistency. I think an intuitive code structure and consistent paradigms help a lot for future contributors to understand the code.\r\n\r\nSharing the approach I took in one of my older projects ([a general purpose CMS](https://github.com/ktmud/david/tree/master/david\r\n)).  It's slightly different than what is proposed, but very similar in concept.\r\n\r\nMy python files are organized [like this](https://github.com/ktmud/david/tree/master/david):\r\n\r\n```\r\n├── __init__.py\r\n├── app.py\r\n├── core/   # core data models, user accounts, base data entities etc\r\n├── ext/      # 3rd-party/non-essential extensions, s3 uploads, etc\r\n├── lib/       # db mixins, cache decorators, utilities\r\n├── modules/   # modules as organized in the main menu (URL route)\r\n│   ├── __init__.py  # import and compose all modules\r\n│   ├── module_1\r\n│   │   ├── __init__.py\r\n│   │   ├── admin.py   # admin views, a separate Blueprint for editing objects\r\n│   │   ├── model.py   # operation on data entities, objects for data access\r\n│   │   └── view.py     # User facing Blueprint for \"module_1\", handlers parsing parameters\r\n│   ├── module_2\r\n│   │   ├── __init__.py\r\n│   │   ├── admin.py\r\n│   │   ├── model.py\r\n│   │   └── view.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nI find the separation of core/shared functionalities and addition of a \"modules\" folder especially useful because it makes the whole project easier to navigate.\r\n\r\nLoading modules  and booting the app is as simple as [this](https://github.com/ktmud/david/blob/master/david/ext/modules.py). \r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef load_module(app, name):\r\n    \"\"\"Dynamically load modules in the `modules/` folder.\r\n    package = 'david.modules.%s' % name\r\n    mod = __import__(package, fromlist=['admin', 'bp', 'setup', 'view'])\r\n\r\n    # register module blueprint and setup\r\n    register_views(app, mod)\r\n\r\n    if hasattr(mod, 'view'):\r\n        register_views(app, mod.view)\r\n\r\n    return mod\r\n\r\ndef register_views(app, *view_modules):\r\n    \"\"\"Register views, including API endpoints\"\"\"\r\n    for v in view_modules:\r\n        if hasattr(v, 'bp'):\r\n            app.register_blueprint(v.bp)\r\n        if hasattr(v, 'setup'):\r\n            v.setup(app)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is similar to what the `boot.py` file may achieve.\r\n\r\nHope this helps.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/586536501/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/586542176","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/9143#issuecomment-586542176","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/9143","id":586542176,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NjU0MjE3Ng==","user":{"login":"mapingsheng1025","id":2697694,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTc2OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2697694?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapingsheng1025","html_url":"https://github.com/mapingsheng1025","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapingsheng1025/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapingsheng1025/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapingsheng1025/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapingsheng1025/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapingsheng1025/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapingsheng1025/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapingsheng1025/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapingsheng1025/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapingsheng1025/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-15T01:59:06Z","updated_at":"2020-02-15T01:59:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"**Thank you, but another problem arises**\r\n\r\n(superset) [root@node04 superset]# flask fab create-admin\r\nUsername [admin]: admin\r\nUser first name [admin]: admin\r\nUser last name [user]: superset\r\nEmail [admin@fab.org]: maning1025@163.com\r\nPassword:\r\nRepeat for confirmation:\r\nUsage: flask fab create-admin [OPTIONS]\r\n\r\nError: Could not locate a Flask application.

We can still say that they occur within `app.py` but the specifics are encapsulated on the module manager itself.\r\n\r\nThis way:\r\n- We would reduce the centralized complexity of `app.py`\r\n- Handle module specifics at the module level\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```\r\n- superset/\r\n    - datasets/\r\n        - manager.py (implements `register_views`)\r\n        - commands/\r\n          - <CRUD> (create.py, update.py, delete.py ...)\r\n          - <Custom> (export.py, ...)\r\n        - api.py\r\n        - schemas.py\r\n        - dao.py\r\n    - dashboards/\r\n      ...\r\n    - charts/\r\n    - databases/\r\n    - commands/\r\n       - base.py\r\n         ....\r\n    - api/\r\n        - base.py\r\n....\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo `app.py` would call each module's `manager.register_views()` with additional pre and post hooks. This kind of pattern can open up the app for external extensions, since additional modules can be independently installed (pip) and loaded in order using config, for example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nADDONS = [\r\n    middleware1.Middleware1Manager,\r\n    middleware2.Middleware2Manager,\r\n    ...\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nJust a thought, could db_engine_specs follow a similar pattern?\r\n\r\nThe blueprints are handled by FAB's `BaseApi` or it's child `ModelRestApi` that creates a blueprint with all routes registered under the same API resource namespace, `api/v1/dataset/*`, `api/v1/databases` and OpenAPI spec tag/grouping. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/586899389/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/586907146","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/9125#issuecomment-586907146","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/9125","id":586907146,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NjkwNzE0Ng==","user":{"login":"ranugoldan","id":11420821,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDIwODIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11420821?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ranugoldan","html_url":"https://github.com/ranugoldan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ranugoldan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ranugoldan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ranugoldan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ranugoldan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ranugoldan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ranugoldan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ranugoldan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ranugoldan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ranugoldan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-17T09:51:26Z","updated_at":"2020-02-17T09:51:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@villebro sorry for late reply.
