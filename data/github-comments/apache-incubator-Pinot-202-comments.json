Look into the test code for the case where delimiter config & actual delimiter in csv are different.\r\n\r\nWhen the set delimiter is different from the actual delimiter the entire line would be read as a single field.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1714880226/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1715048423","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/11501#issuecomment-1715048423","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/11501","id":1715048423,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5mOY_n","user":{"login":"jvenant","id":1199901,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTk5MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1199901?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvenant","html_url":"https://github.com/jvenant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvenant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvenant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvenant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvenant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvenant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvenant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvenant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvenant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvenant/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-12T06:10:20Z","updated_at":"2023-09-12T06:10:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi,\r\n\r\nFollowing

My concern is that we are trying to prove that the fix is working using tests/heap dump, etc. vs the restart will just work. \r\n\r\nLet me elaborate a bit on the nature of problem we saw in our production.\r\n\r\nWe have a cluster several thousands of tables served by handful of brokers.\r\n\r\nA really bad query that was fetching around 150MB of data from each of the 160 servers (fan out was 160) caused direct memory OOM on broker. Note that this was a soft OOM (broker didn't crash unlike Java heap space OOM)\r\n\r\nThe problem is not just with the OOM. It is the cascade impact of this OOM on the overall stability / availability of the system.\r\n\r\nConcurrent queries around the same time and subsequent ones also failed because\r\n\r\n- All the direct buffer references were held up. Our heap dump confirmed it\r\n- Netty threads were relentlessly trying to allocate memory -- multiple times per channel-per server. So the same failure was happening repeatedly. Netty called into NIO to allocate direct memory. The latter tried to first GC. GC didn't help because the corresponding direct buffer reference was still in scope. \r\n\r\nSo this collectively destabilized and reduced the availability. Now we also restarted initially when we detected this to mitigate but by that time it had already negatively impacted our critical production use case and it missed the SLA -- because of the cascading impact on the concurrent / subsequent queries. \r\n\r\nI understand and agree that restart is simpler but from detailed RCA there are definitely opportunities in code that could have prevented this or at least reduce the impact. @jasperjiaguo 's fix is aimed at that and that's why we also shared numbers on memory overhead reduction testing + subsequent queries working fine after the short recovery.\r\n\r\nI agree that shutting down channels will cause the other queries to fail but that particular impact may not be worse than the potential real life worst impact that I described above -- which without manual interference or other tooling etc will continue to cause problems on the cluster IMHO\r\n\r\n@soumitra-st @ege-st - I hope this gives some insight into where we are coming from.

~~If the entries are not pre-sorted then sorting it beforehand (takes `O(m logm)`) is probably not necessary?~~ @vvivekiyer brought up a good point yes it should be helpful if it's one sort per server.\r\n\r\nIt would be ideal if we can have some JMH benchmarks before making this the default behavior; as the benefit of the optimization might be offsetted by it's complexity when `m` is small?

Note that this was a soft OOM (broker didn't crash unlike Java heap space OOM)\r\n\r\nSo the broker is able to process the responese from one server technically, but all servers (150+) together sending back these mid sized responses together will create a situation where each channel allocates some amont of direct buffer, but then the direct memory is filled and no server can proceed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1720244864/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1720255055","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/11549#issuecomment-1720255055","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/11549","id":1720255055,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5miQJP","user":{"login":"ankitsultana","id":8644710,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NDQ3MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8644710?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankitsultana","html_url":"https://github.com/ankitsultana","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankitsultana/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankitsultana/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankitsultana/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankitsultana/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankitsultana/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankitsultana/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankitsultana/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankitsultana/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankitsultana/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-14T22:49:50Z","updated_at":"2023-09-14T22:49:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The question was whether we hit this issue with 0.11 or a later version.

It caused massively oom and timeout even with 1 query. Using the json index would be a huge improvement over that. Pinot json index today already collects and sort json path+value. Group by json path (e.g. $a.b) can take average of the sorted dictionary to quickly locate the portion of the dictionary ids. I think doing this will provide great speed up compared with what we have today.
