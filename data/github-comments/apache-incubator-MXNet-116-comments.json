explained part of my solution in the post https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/issues/3400. I will put them here again. \nIt seems the issue was that MXNet could not get the values of those environment variables correctly. So I hard-coded those environment variable values in the sourcecode. \n\nI made two changes, both are in function \"void Van::Start()\" in mxnet/ps-lite/src/van.cc:\nthe line\nscheduler_.hostname = std::string(CHECK_NOTNULL(Environment::Get()->find(\"DMLC_PS_ROOT_URI\")));\nwas changed to \nscheduler_.hostname = std::string(\"10.149.0.1\"); // this is the infiniband ip of my scheduler node\n\nand the line \nif (itf) interface = std::string(itf);\nwas changed to \ninterface = std::string(\"ib0\"); // the infiniband interface on all of my worker nodes\n\nbecause it seems the line \"const char\\*  itf = Environment::Get()->find(\"DMLC_INTERFACE\");\" was also not working. The value of variable interface was empty when I printed it out.\n\nSo, although I set the environment variable DMLC_INTERFACE and DMLC_PS_ROOT_URI, it seems MXNet could not get their values correctly, at least it was not working on my machine. I solved it in a non-elegant way. If it is a bug, maybe you @piiswrong can fix it and push the changes into the repo.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/252435433/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/252438296","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/3481#issuecomment-252438296","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/3481","id":252438296,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MjQzODI5Ng==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-08T17:45:42Z","updated_at":"2016-10-08T17:45:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"please rebase after https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/pull/3482 get merged\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/252438296/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/252438302","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/3476#issuecomment-252438302","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/3476","id":252438302,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MjQzODMwMg==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-08T17:45:52Z","updated_at":"2016-10-08T17:45:52Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/pull/3482\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/252438302/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/252440265","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/3449#issuecomment-252440265","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/3449","id":252440265,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MjQ0MDI2NQ==","user":{"login":"rayjs","id":5567865,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1Njc4NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5567865?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayjs","html_url":"https://github.com/rayjs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayjs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayjs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayjs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayjs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayjs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayjs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayjs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayjs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayjs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-08T18:26:01Z","updated_at":"2016-10-08T18:26:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"There are two ways to do this:\n\nFirst one uses file iterator.

, you are right, it was not caused by M40.\nFirst, I use cpu to test a simple code with convolution, then I got strange outputs.\n\nThe code I used:\n\n```\nimport mxnet as mx\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef test():\n    data_in = mx.symbol.Variable('data')\n    conv = mx.symbol.Convolution(data=data_in, kernel=(3, 3), num_filter=3)\n    #data\n    datatmp = np.ones((1, 1, 3, 3))\n    mxdata = mx.nd.array(datatmp)\n    weightmp = np.ones((3, 1, 3, 3))\n    mxweight = mx.nd.array(weightmp)\n    biastmp = np.zeros((3,))\n    mxbias = mx.nd.array(biastmp)\n    #print\n    print 'mxdata:\\n',mxdata.asnumpy()\n    print 'mxweight:\\n',mxweight.asnumpy()\n    print 'mxbias:\\n',mxbias.asnumpy()\n    #bind and forward\n    exe_c = conv.bind(ctx=mx.cpu(), args=[mxdata, mxweight, mxbias])\n    out = exe_c.forward()[0]\n    print '\\noutput:\\n',out.asnumpy()\n\ntest()\n```\n\nThe code runs correctly in my local machine with K40 (Windows Server 2012 R2/6.3.9600 N/A Build 9600), and outputs `[9,9,9]`.\n\nBut I got results in the M40 machine (Windows Server 2012 R2/6.3.9600 N/A Build 9600) as follows:\n\n```\nmxdata:\n[[[[ 1.  1.  1.]\n   [ 1.  1.  1.]\n   [ 1.  1.  1.]]]]\nmxweight:\n[[[[ 1.  1.  1.]\n   [ 1.  1.  1.]\n   [ 1.  1.  1.]]]\n\n\n [[[ 1.  1.  1.]\n   [ 1.  1.  1.]\n   [ 1.  1.  1.]]]\n\n\n [[[ 1.  1.  1.]\n   [ 1.  1.  1.]\n   [ 1.  1.
