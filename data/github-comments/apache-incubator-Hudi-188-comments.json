But with this patch, we are running into NumberFormatException, bcoz, in one of the internal classes of hive, it expects parameters to have entires for FAST_STATS (\"numFiles\" and. \"totalSize\"). This is a requirement only for a partition that is getting updated. For a new partition, this is not an issue. \r\n\r\nHere is the flow. \r\n\r\nHiveDDLExecutor.alter_partitions \r\n -> IMetaStoreClient.alter_partitions(String dbName, String tblName, List<Partition> newParts, EnvironmentContext  \r\n        environmentContext) \r\n          -> HiveMetaStore L3932 : \r\n             this.alterHandler.alterPartitions(this.getMS(), this.wh, db_name, tbl_name, new_parts, environmentContext, this);\r\n                 -> HiveAlterHandler L499\r\n```\r\n if (MetaStoreUtils.requireCalStats(this.hiveConf, newPart, tmpPart, tbl, environmentContext)) {\r\n            if (MetaStoreUtils.isFastStatsSame(newPart, tmpPart)) {\r\n              MetaStoreUtils.updateBasicState(environmentContext, tmpPart.getParameters());\r\n            } else {\r\n              MetaStoreUtils.updatePartitionStatsFast(tmpPart, wh, false, true, environmentContext);\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the below code, oldPart refers to already existing partition inhive and newPart refers to incoming Partition data. \r\n```\r\n static boolean isFastStatsSame(Partition oldPart, Partition newPart) {\r\n    // requires to calculate stats if new and old have different fast stats\r\n    if ((oldPart != null) && (oldPart.getParameters() != null)) {\r\n      for (String stat : StatsSetupConst.fastStats) {\r\n        if (oldPart.getParameters().containsKey(stat)) {\r\n          Long oldStat = Long.parseLong(oldPart.getParameters().get(stat));\r\n          Long newStat = Long.parseLong(newPart.getParameters().get(stat));\r\n          if (!oldStat.equals(newStat)) {\r\n            return false;\r\n          }\r\n        } else {\r\n          return false;\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n      return true;\r\n    }\r\n    return false;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n  public static final String[] fastStats = new String[] {NUM_FILES,TOTAL_SIZE};\r\n```\r\n\r\nWondering how come we did not face this issue so far? What are the cases that will result in partition updates in general in our hive sync tool? I understand partition addition, but what constitutes partition updates? I tried adding some data files to an existing partition in unit tests, but our sync tool did not detect the partition as qualified for an update. \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1002810449/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1002811744","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/4405#issuecomment-1002811744","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/4405","id":1002811744,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM47xbFg","user":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-29T23:25:21Z","updated_at":"2021-12-29T23:25:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I made a hacky fix in .HMSDDLExecutor.updatePartitionsToTable to check if my theory is right\r\n```\r\nMap<String, String> params = new HashMap<>();\r\n        params.put(\"numFiles\",\"0\");\r\n        params.put(\"totalSize\",\"0\");\r\n        return new Partition(partitionValues, syncConfig.databaseName, tableName, 0, 0, sd, params);\r\n```\r\nand the test succeeds. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1002811744/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1002814514","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/4429#issuecomment-1002814514","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/4429","id":1002814514,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM47xbwy","user":{"login":"vingov","id":1142498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDI0OTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1142498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vingov","html_url":"https://github.com/vingov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vingov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vingov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vingov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vingov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vingov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vingov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vingov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vingov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vingov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-29T23:39:42Z","updated_at":"2021-12-29T23:48:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@xushiyan -
