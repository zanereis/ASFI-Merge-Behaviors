for reviewing this @jhuynh1!. Regarding your comments and questions, please find my answers below.\r\n\r\n> I'm kind of curious if there is a way to not cache if we know the result set is size 1 or some small number. Mostly whether we should even explore that in a different ticket. Over optimization at this point probably.\r\n\r\nAgreed, we can try to figure this out in another ticket.\r\n\r\n> Is it possible for someone to access a cq and grab it's query context and somehow used the cached values in it's query context to execute methods/field it shouldn't have access to?\r\n\r\nI don't think it's possible, no... that \"someone\" would need knowledge about internal Geode classes **plus** permissions/priviledges to connect to the cluster, deploy code and execute queries and/or functions alltogether.
