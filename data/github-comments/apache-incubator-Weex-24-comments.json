 Thank you for pointing out this question. It's really a perplexing feature of js framework.\r\n\r\nAs you mentioned, If developer register a `\"test\"` component with an `appendChild` method. Under the hood, js framework will create a new type of `WeexElement`, and add the new method to its prototype, the pseudo-code is like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nclass WeexElement extends Element {}\r\n\r\n// custom methods of the \"test\" component\r\nWeexElement.prototype.appendChild = function () { /* ... */ }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt runtime, the custom `appendChild` method will be called instead of the internal one if it exists. It gives developers more capability to customize components, however, maybe it's too powerful and too hard to master.\r\n\r\nAfter consideration, I think we can solve it in two ways:\r\n\r\n1. For those render-related methods, prevented them to be overridden. Such as the `appendChild`, `insertBefore`, and `removeChild`, those methods are integrated and hard to be replaced. I think we can make them immutable to make sure the rendering logic is reliable.\r\n2. For those getter/setter methods, developers can still override it as they wish. Such as the `setAttr`, `setStyles`, and `toJSON`, they are independent methods, it's feasible for developers to override it with their own features.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-weex/issues/comments/445668341/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-weex/issues/comments/445738344","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-weex/issues/1591#issuecomment-445738344","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-weex/issues/1591","id":445738344,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NTczODM0NA==","user":{"login":"YorkShen","id":4162544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNjI1NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4162544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YorkShen","html_url":"https://github.com/YorkShen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YorkShen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YorkShen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YorkShen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YorkShen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YorkShen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YorkShen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YorkShen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YorkShen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YorkShen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-10T08:56:04Z","updated_at":"2018-12-10T08:56:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It
