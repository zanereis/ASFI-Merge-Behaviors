Or the context is missing. The problem here is, that a snippet in this way will be part of each language that I registered, which doesn't make sense for 95%. log -> console.log, make sense for TS and JS but not for C#, F#, erlang, etc.\r\n\r\nSo if you have a look at the select box and choose \"php\" below the list of snippets there are 3 register cards: expanded text, description and context, which is missing for textmate language. So either we need to add each language, that I have created via textmate grammar into the drop down list to set the context automatically or we need to add the context and have a list there for each language that I have registered.\r\n\r\nWhen you have a look into a language based on textmate for vs code, you have this piece of code to register snippets:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n\"snippets\": [{\r\n   \"language\": \"erlang\",\r\n   \"path\": \"./snippets/erlang.json\"\r\n}],\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich is part of the package.json and points to a json file where we add those snippets via json:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"erlang gen_event behavior\" : {\r\n        \"prefix\" : \"erl-gen_event-behavior\",\r\n        \"body\"  : [\r\n            \"-behaviour(gen_event).\",\r\n            \"\",\r\n            \"-export([init/1, handle_event/2, handle_call/2, handle_info/2, terminate/2, code_change/3]).\",\r\n            \"\",\r\n            \"init(_Args) ->\",\r\n            \"    {ok, []}.\",\r\n            \"\",\r\n            \"handle_event(_Event, State) ->\",\r\n            \"    {ok, State}.\",\r\n            \"\",\r\n            \"handle_call(_Request, State) ->\",\r\n            \"    {ok, no_reply, State}.\",\r\n            \"\",\r\n            \"handle_info(_Info, State) ->\",\r\n            \"    {ok, State}.\",\r\n            \"\",\r\n            \"terminate(_Args, _State) ->\",\r\n            \"    ok.\",\r\n            \"\",\r\n            \"code_change(_OldVsn, State, _Extra) ->\",\r\n            \"    {ok, State}.\",\r\n            \"\"\r\n        ],\r\n        \"description\" : \"generate an empty gen_event\"\r\n    },\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I also prefer this way of doing it and for this, the UI needs to have more fields like \"Snippets file: \". Just an idea. At the moment, you can create basic syntax highlighting, folding, snippets easily with some files as you can see in the VS Code example of erlang. What needs to be added to our textmate implementation is exactly this option for snippets which covers your ticket.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1117691466/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1117692574","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/4064#issuecomment-1117692574","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4064","id":1117692574,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5CnqKe","user":{"login":"Chris2011","id":795658,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NTY1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/795658?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011","html_url":"https://github.com/Chris2011","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-04T18:54:47Z","updated_at":"2022-05-04T18:55:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"And to your comment for LSP, I don't see that in LSP.

But maybe I am missing something here.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1117734591/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1117787051","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/3995#issuecomment-1117787051","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/3995","id":1117787051,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5CoBOr","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-04T19:46:19Z","updated_at":"2022-05-04T19:46:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I see several modules from the java area in the list of affected modules.

So if you have a look at the select box and choose \"php\" below the list of snippets there are 3 register cards: expanded text, description and context, which is missing for textmate language.\r\n\r\nSurprisingly I had never realized about the *Context* tab.\r\n\r\n> So either we need to add each language, that I have created via textmate grammar into the drop down list to set the context automatically or we need to add the context and have a list there for each language that I have registered.\r\n\r\nI believe that the first option would be more correct.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think that snippets should already work in their current form. We (users) can already introduce prefixes in our abbreviations to overcome this limitation. So, for example, `ts_while` would generate a `while` loop for TypeScript, `kt_while` would be generate one for Kotlin, and so on. If we don't want to press the `[Shift]` key to type the underscore, we can use any other delimiter or none at all.\r\n\r\nWith all this I'm not saying that the IDE doesn't need snippets/templates separated by language (I think the opposite). I'm just saying that, first, templates should work with TextMate grammars in general. But I don't know why they don't.\r\n\r\n> And to your comment for LSP, I don't see that in LSP. Sure that would be also cool, but with a simple config file like for NetBeans core langauges it is XML and like VS Code does, is json, that could be enough to work. We just need to implement this. :)\r\n\r\nThe LSP specification seems to support snippets already, as I said. They've at least one advantage over snippets in the client-side: the server knows better about the context (i.e. variable types) and can be more precise when providing choices to fill the placeholders. For example, think on the `whileit` template for Java code, in NetBeans IDE. The editor only offers those variables, in the current scope, that inherit from `java.util.Iterator`.\r\n\r\nBut LSP also has its disadvantages. The most important is that each LSP server that you want to use needs to support this feature (which is optional). If it doesn't support it, you're *left in mud*.\r\n\r\nSo, after thinking much on this, I believe that client-side support is a must. After all, if a specific LSP server ever supports this feature, maybe NetBeans can delegate to it (as long as the templates are minimally compatible).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1119379655/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1119499057","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/4077#issuecomment-1119499057","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4077","id":1119499057,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5CujMx","user":{"login":"ebarboni","id":6940099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDAwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6940099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni","html_url":"https://github.com/ebarboni","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-06T11:03:54Z","updated_at":"2022-05-06T11:03:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 better to have to have the fix in upstream lib.\r\nstill jdk 8 compatible perfect","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1119499057/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1119581741","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/4061#issuecomment-1119581741","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4061","id":1119581741,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5Cu3Yt","user":{"login":"ebresie","id":370894,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MDg5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/370894?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebresie","html_url":"https://github.com/ebresie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebresie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebresie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebresie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebresie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebresie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebresie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebresie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebresie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebresie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-06T12:49:06Z","updated_at":"2022-05-06T13:02:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm a user of JIRA in normal work life, so I see value in the plugin.  \r\n\r\nHowever, since Netbeans development is moving towards using GitHub issues instead of JIRA tickets (which I believe may been changed to \"read only\" for most), the value out of the box is less a concern in the context of development of Netbeans IDE.
