My main concern in doing this is creating more table configs that are tied to some specific action and possibly just one action implementation. Are we reasonably confident that these are applicable to other implementations of the action? What about to other rewrite implementations like Netflix's AutoOptimize?\r\n\r\nOne thing that you may want to consider is changing this from encoding rewrite configuration in table properties to being able to set action settings in table properties. We could define a name for each action, like `rewrite-files` and support table properties of the form `actions.<action-name>.<action-config>`. Here, that would be like `actions.rewrite-files.partial-progress.enabled`. That scopes the settings enough that we don't need to decide whether these apply in all situations right now.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/955791800/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/955807529","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3373#issuecomment-955807529","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3373","id":955807529,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX844-Hcp","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-31T23:03:08Z","updated_at":"2021-10-31T23:03:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks great.

it looks like that is a different finalizer. If you were seeing something that was closed by the Iceberg finalizer, you'd get a stack trace for where the stream was created and it would be no longer referenced. I think in this case, your `FileSystem` is getting closed by the finalizer, which closes all streams associated with it. That's why you get the DFS classes in those logs (I think).

We lose the data somewhere later.\r\n\r\nI will need some more time to find the problem.\r\n\r\nThanks for the good repro case!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/957774548/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/957777404","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3378#issuecomment-957777404","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3378","id":957777404,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX845FoX8","user":{"login":"samredai","id":43911210,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTExMjEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43911210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai","html_url":"https://github.com/samredai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-02T15:06:33Z","updated_at":"2021-11-02T15:06:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jackye1995 what are your thoughts on moving the docs out to their own iceberg-docs repo? The docs deployment script is very simple (~2 commands). I wouldn't want to add too much complexity there (just yet) to add versioned docs but I do agree that having the massive set of html files in the repo interferes with the local IDE experience.\r\n\r\nIf we separate out the docs to a separate repo, we can then maintain a single copy of the docs in the site directory on the master branch here. For each iceberg release, we could copy that into a directory in the iceberg-docs repo named after the version. We can also do some simple redirects to allow a `/latest/` path.\r\n\r\nThis also allows us to add more bonafide docs versioning (such as your suggestion) without creating too much noise in the main iceberg repo.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/957777404/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/957830553","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3423#issuecomment-957830553","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3423","id":957830553,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX845F1WZ","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-02T15:31:18Z","updated_at":"2021-11-02T15:31:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks, @cabhishek!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/957830553/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/957838331","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3444#issuecomment-957838331","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3444","id":957838331,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX845F3P7","user":{"login":"RussellSpitzer","id":413025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/413025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer","html_url":"https://github.com/RussellSpitzer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-02T15:35:03Z","updated_at":"2021-11-02T15:35:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Excellent!

First and foremost, you should check out the docs on:\r\n- table maintenance https://iceberg.apache.org/#maintenance/#table-maintenance \r\n- streaming table maintenance: https://iceberg.apache.org/#spark-structured-streaming/#maintenance-for-streaming-tables\r\n\r\nIf you're running the expire snapshots operation, keep in mind that there is the option for how many days worth of data do you want to retain. By default, the spark action to expire snapshots retains 5 days worth of snapshots, which would explain why no files are being removed.\r\n\r\nWhen you run the expire snapshots job, do you see any logs saying things are enabled?\r\nSome links that might help:\r\n- Javadoc for the action itself: https://iceberg.apache.org/#javadoc/0.12.0/org/apache/iceberg/ExpireSnapshots.html\r\n- Docs for the options from the Spark maintenance actions: https://iceberg.apache.org/#spark-procedures/#metadata-management\r\n\r\nI'd also make sure that your table doesn't have `gc.enabled = true` as a table property. If that's set to `false` (default should be `true`), then files won't be removed regardless.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it's possible that you have orphan files from commits that did not succeed and needed to be retried. You should also run the `remove orphan files` action: https://iceberg.apache.org/#maintenance/#remove-orphan-files\r\n\r\nHow are you running the actions? With Java code or with Spark? I don't believe that Flink presently supports all of the maintenance procedures. Either way, given that it's only 10 hours worth of data, you'll definitely need to pass in the timestamp you want to expire older than.\r\n\r\nTry it out, ensuring that you pass in something for the `older_than` field of the Spark procedure (or the equivalent method if using the Java API). Something like `now() - INTERVAL '4 hours'` or `System.currentTimeMillis - (Duration.ofHours(4).getSeconds() * 1000)` or something.\r\n\r\nLet us know if that solves your problem, particularly passing in a maximum age of files to keep. The default is well over 10 hours in all cases.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/958179727/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/958188779","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3443#issuecomment-958188779","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3443","id":958188779,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX845HMzr","user":{"login":"kbendick","id":9833362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MzMzNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9833362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick","html_url":"https://github.com/kbendick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-02T21:41:52Z","updated_at":"2021-11-02T21:41:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Unfortunately this is quite a lot of new things to backport for this fix.\r\n\r\nThis fix will go out with the next major version release.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/958188779/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/958196706","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/3426#issuecomment-958196706","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3426","id":958196706,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX845HOvi","user":{"login":"samredai","id":43911210,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTExMjEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43911210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai","html_url":"https://github.com/samredai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-02T21:46:42Z","updated_at":"2021-11-02T21:46:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sorry for the noise here, GitHub pages sets a default 10 minute cache but that's persisting in some browsers for some reason.
