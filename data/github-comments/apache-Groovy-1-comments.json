But so long as not handling such cases doesn't cause a problem, we can probably endeavor to tweak the behavior to be smarter down the track.

I'm busy with the exams comming and my Android project to finish.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/103635974/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/103637069","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/4#issuecomment-103637069","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/4","id":103637069,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwMzYzNzA2OQ==","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-19T19:11:23Z","updated_at":"2015-05-19T19:11:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Where can I see the compilation errors ?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/103637069/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/103664194","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/10#issuecomment-103664194","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/10","id":103664194,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwMzY2NDE5NA==","user":{"login":"fpavageau","id":800088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMDA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/800088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpavageau","html_url":"https://github.com/fpavageau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpavageau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpavageau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpavageau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpavageau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpavageau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpavageau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpavageau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpavageau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpavageau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-19T20:50:31Z","updated_at":"2015-05-19T20:50:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I like that, I've pushed the modified version.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/103664194/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/103670482","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/10#issuecomment-103670482","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/10","id":103670482,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwMzY3MDQ4Mg==","user":{"login":"paulk-asert","id":280016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MDAxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/280016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert","html_url":"https://github.com/paulk-asert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-19T21:23:11Z","updated_at":"2015-05-19T21:23:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yep, that's good too.

have just created a different but related PR (https://github.com/apache/incubator-groovy/pull/21). It turns @Canonical into a meta-annotation (aka alias/aggregate/collector). It doesn't provide exactly what you're after but comes very close, e.g.:\n\n```\nimport groovy.transform.*\n@Canonical\nclass Foo {\n    int a\n}\n@Canonical(callSuper=true, includeSuperProperties=true, includeNames=true)\nclass Bar extends Foo {\n    int b\n}\n@Canonical(callSuper=true, includeSuper=true)\n@TupleConstructor(includeSuperProperties=true)\nclass Baz extends Foo {\n    int b\n}\ndef (b1, b2, b3) = [new Bar(a:5, b:20), new Bar(10, 20), new Baz(15, 20)]\nassert [b1, b2, b3].toString() == '[Bar(b:20, a:5), Bar(b:20, a:10), Baz(20, Foo(15))]'\nassert b1 != b2\nassert b1.hashCode() != b2.hashCode()\n```\n\nMore importantly, the plumbing done to enable the above PR would prohibit the proposals you have here but would allow you to define your own @SuperCanonical or whatever that had exactly the semantics that you would like without any AST-level programming by defining your own meta-annotation, e.g.:\n\n```\nimport groovy.transform.*\n\n@ToString(includeSuperProperties=true)\n@TupleConstructor(includeSuperProperties=true)\n@EqualsAndHashCode(callSuper=true)\n@AnnotationCollector\n@interface SuperCanonical { }\n\n@Canonical\nclass Foo {\n  int a\n}\n@SuperCanonical\nclass Bar extends Foo {\n  int b\n}\ndef (b1, b2) = [new Bar(a:5, b:20), new Bar(10, 20)]\nassert [b1, b2].toString() == '[Bar(20, 5), Bar(20, 10)]'\nassert b1 != b2\nassert b1.hashCode() != b2.hashCode()\n```\n\nLet me know if you have any feedback.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/103861415/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/104359932","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/10#issuecomment-104359932","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/10","id":104359932,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwNDM1OTkzMg==","user":{"login":"PascalSchumacher","id":2707245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDcyNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2707245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher","html_url":"https://github.com/PascalSchumacher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-21T17:15:18Z","updated_at":"2015-05-21T17:15:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/104359932/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/104804778","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/22#issuecomment-104804778","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/22","id":104804778,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwNDgwNDc3OA==","user":{"login":"paulk-asert","id":280016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MDAxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/280016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert","html_url":"https://github.com/paulk-asert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-23T00:02:13Z","updated_at":"2015-05-23T00:02:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks
