 Thanks for doing this.\r\nAs you might have noticed since your PR was on master branch. The build https://builds.apache.org/blue/organizations/jenkins/incubator-mxnet/detail/PR-8175/5/pipeline  didn't use your Jenkins Change. So even if the build has succeeded your change has not been verified . The very ideal way to verify the Jenkins change is by publishing your change to a branch other than master hence that branch can use this Jenkins (with your change) file. I know its a bit confusing but thats how the Jenkins is :)  \r\n\r\n@indhub has recently created a new branch \"ci_test\" your change should be verified using that branch. \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/336266464/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/336274700","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/8242#issuecomment-336274700","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/8242","id":336274700,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNjI3NDcwMA==","user":{"login":"piiswrong","id":568948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODk0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong","html_url":"https://github.com/piiswrong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-12T21:21:14Z","updated_at":"2017-10-12T21:21:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@sxjscience ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/336274700/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/336275557","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/8239#issuecomment-336275557","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/8239","id":336275557,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNjI3NTU1Nw==","user":{"login":"piiswrong","id":568948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODk0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong","html_url":"https://github.com/piiswrong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-12T21:23:48Z","updated_at":"2017-10-12T21:23:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for reporting.
