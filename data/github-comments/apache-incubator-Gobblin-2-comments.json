It looks ready to be merged.\n\nOne comment I had that can be addressed in another JIRA, is that I don't think we need to force the user to specify \"--workdir\" or $GOBBLIN_WORK_DIR in order for the script to run. Rather in the gobblin-mapreduce.properties file the user should set GOBBLIN_WORK_DIR.\n\nThe reason is that the launch scripts should only take in parameters that are needed to launch the job. The properties needed to run the job should be in the \".properties\" file. The GOBBLIN_WORK_DIR is not needed to setup and launch the job, but only needed during runtime. Thus, I think it makes more sense to put GOBBLIN_WORK_DIR in the \".properties\" file.\n\nThe layout of the .properties can be simple:\n\ngobblin.work.dir=working/\nwriter.staging.dir=${gobblin.work.dir}/task-staging\netc.\n\n@liyinan926 thoughts?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/78574607/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/78593413","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/46#issuecomment-78593413","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/46","id":78593413,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4NTkzNDEz","user":{"login":"liyinan926","id":3709137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MDkxMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3709137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926","html_url":"https://github.com/liyinan926","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-12T20:02:24Z","updated_at":"2015-03-12T20:03:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I agree that this can be addressed in a separate pull request.
