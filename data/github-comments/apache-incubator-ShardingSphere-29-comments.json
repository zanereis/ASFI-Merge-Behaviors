investigated the source code of Java MySQL JDBC.\r\n\r\nThere are two types, one is the MySQL Type, another one is the JDBC type.\r\nMySQL Type means how MySQL store the data.\r\nJDBC type means how JDBC process the data.\r\n\r\nMySQL type `BINARY` will be mapped to JDBC type `CHAR`, but this is a special type of string. Which should encode and decode by the users. [MySQL Docs](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/binary-varbinary.html)\r\n\r\ncom/mysql/jdbc/ResultSetImpl.java line 4516\r\n```java\r\n            case Types.CHAR:\r\n            case Types.VARCHAR:\r\n                if (!field.isOpaqueBinary()) {\r\n                    return getString(columnIndex);\r\n                }\r\n\r\n                return getBytes(columnIndex);\r\n```\r\n\r\ncom/mysql/jdbc/Field.java line 705\r\n```java\r\n    boolean isOpaqueBinary() throws SQLException {\r\n\r\n        //\r\n        // Detect CHAR(n) CHARACTER SET BINARY which is a synonym for fixed-length binary types\r\n        //\r\n\r\n        if (this.collationIndex == CharsetMapping.MYSQL_COLLATION_INDEX_binary && isBinary()\r\n                && (this.getMysqlType() == MysqlDefs.FIELD_TYPE_STRING || this.getMysqlType() == MysqlDefs.FIELD_TYPE_VAR_STRING)) {\r\n\r\n            if (this.originalTableNameLength == 0 && (this.connection != null && !this.connection.versionMeetsMinimum(5, 0, 25))) {\r\n                return false; // Probably from function\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            // Okay, queries resolved by temp tables also have

\"binary\".equalsIgnoreCase(getEncoding()));\r\n\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat means Sharding-Proxy think this is `CHAR`, so send the data as String to user.\r\nActually this is a byte array in JDBC.\r\n\r\nWhat's more, Sharding-Proxy shouldn't try to convert JDBC type to MySQL type.\r\nFor example, in JDBC source code, both `MysqlDefs.FIELD_TYPE_JSON` and `MysqlDefs.FIELD_TYPE_STRING` will convert to `Types.CHAR`.\r\n\r\nIf Sharding-Proxy try to do that, the user will receive the wrong MySQL type.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/443238460/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/443243839","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/1533#issuecomment-443243839","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/1533","id":443243839,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MzI0MzgzOQ==","user":{"login":"dozer47528","id":1676951,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzY5NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1676951?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dozer47528","html_url":"https://github.com/dozer47528","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dozer47528/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dozer47528/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dozer47528/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dozer47528/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dozer47528/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dozer47528/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dozer47528/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dozer47528/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dozer47528/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-30T15:43:12Z","updated_at":"2018-11-30T15:43:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"For
