(have covered this in the description of the patch, but anyways).\r\n\r\nAll writes to metadata table happens within the datatable lock. So, implicitly there are no multi-writers (including compaction, cleaning for metadata table) to metadata table. There will always be only one writer. For regular writes to data table, we do conflict resolution, where as for compaction and clustering (data table), we don't do any conflict resolution. Remember taking a lock while committing compaction and clustering in data table is being added in this patch. So, please pay attention if there is something I am missing. All we ensure is to commit by taking a lock.\r\n\r\nSo, in summary, we have a constraint only single writer model to metadata table. May be we need to revisit this when we integrate record level index.

The total size of the entire data set sitting on S3 for this particular Hudi collection is 6.2 GB, with approximately 60 million records.\r\nWe used to have around 230 partitions but the time that takes for \"UpsertPartitioner\" increases significantly, as each partition goes up to over 100 MB. Considering this data size, what do you recommend as an ideal partition number?\r\nAlso, do you recommend maybe increase the number of partitions to something like 5K and keep using the same instance type? Wouldn't that allow smaller instance types to handle small partitions faster? Or should we reduce the number of partitions and use larger instance type?\r\nFor your second point, we use 25 Task instances of type c5.xlarge (4 vCore, 8 GiB memory). Using above configs, we get around 20 executors. What would be the recommended instance type/size for this type of data size? I was under the impression C5 type are generally recommended for this type of work.\r\nAnd for your third point, we are using 3000 for parallelism (hoodie.upsert.shuffle.parallelism). Should we increase that?\r\nAnd finally, is there a way we can increase the number of files under each partitions? Would that help?\r\n\r\nThank you","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/924937292/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/924992319","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/3685#issuecomment-924992319","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3685","id":924992319,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM43IkM_","user":{"login":"rubenssoto","id":36298331,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2Mjk4MzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36298331?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenssoto","html_url":"https://github.com/rubenssoto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenssoto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenssoto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenssoto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenssoto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenssoto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenssoto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenssoto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenssoto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenssoto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-22T14:35:59Z","updated_at":"2021-09-22T14:35:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@xushiyan

received many reports about dependency conflict around Hudi, e.g. [here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-kyuubi/pull/994) and Chinese WeChat group. Considering Hudi depends on so many Hadoop ecosystem components. IMO, it's time to do the dependency governance.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I provided a dependency utility script that can be used to search/diff dependencies of bundles when the contributors change the dependencies. In addition, I have pre-generated a dependency list for some bundles.\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n# use -r option to replace the old file when we introduce new dependencies\r\n./scripts/dependency.sh -p hudi-utilities-bundle_2.11 -r\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have two suggestions:\r\n- build a Github workflow to check the dependency diff, and reviewers should consider any new dependency seriously before merging.\r\n- based on the pre-generated dependency file to do the dependency governance, you can see there are some dependencies that exist in multiple versions for one bundle.\r\n\r\nWDYT? @vinothchandar @xushiyan
