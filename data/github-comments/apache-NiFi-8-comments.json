stand corrected.  The non-integration unit tests are importing CREDENTIALS_FILE from ITAbstractDynamoDBTest, although the integration test itself may not be called.\n\nBut I think the unit tests run by TravisCI should pass.  Either the tests requiring a file in the user's home folder are truly integration tests and need to be marked as such, or the file needs to get checked in to git.  I believe you have checked in a similar test credentials file while working on the AWSCredentialsProviderControllerService, and that seemed to work just fine.\n\nIt's also possible that the unit tests do not need a credentials file at all, since they won't make API calls to AWS.

Unfortunately, this is a side-effect of the attributes not being set \"properly\" in the first place -- the `displayName` value is visible to the end user through the UI and may need to be changed, while the `name` value is used for object resolution in the application and so should not need to change if the messaging changes (imagine future internationalization where the `displayName` value is language-dependent). However, I do think in this case, the new `PropertyDescriptor` should follow the correct convention and a comment added noting the reason for the difference with other `PropertyDescriptor`s in the class. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/190332181/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/190377532","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/246#issuecomment-190377532","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/246","id":190377532,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MDM3NzUzMg==","user":{"login":"mosermw","id":10587698,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTg3Njk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10587698?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosermw","html_url":"https://github.com/mosermw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosermw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosermw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosermw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosermw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosermw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosermw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosermw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosermw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosermw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-29T20:41:16Z","updated_at":"2016-02-29T20:41:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"When a PropertyDescriptor does not have a .displayName() set, then the .name() is used in the UI.

I'm not sure whether it is a problem with the processor, the Splunk Java SDK, Splunk Enterprise or my Splunk configurations:\n- I set up the PutSplunk processor to communicate via UDP and created a UDP data input using the UI for Splunk Enterprise. The PutSplunk is transmitting messages at ~1 per second. While it's transmitting no new events are created yet in Splunk Enterprise (verified by viewing a real time view of the past 30 seconds). I stop the PutSplunk processor and then run a search in Splunk UI to see if any events came in on that port. There is one event that is registered at when I started the processor and contains effectively all (didn't count the seconds I was sending) the data that was generated. I'm not sure why all the UDP messages are grouped together. When I set PutSplunk to send messages every 20 seconds the UDP messages are treated as their own event.\n- I set up PutSplunk to communicate via TCP using SSL. I looked for options to create a Data Input in Splunk Enterprise using TCP and SSL but couldn't find anything definitive (and all my searches turned up results for the Forwarder). I enabled SSL in Splunk Web by going to the general settings and notice that SSL properties are in the inputs.conf and server.conf files. I attempt to send data using PutSplunk using SSL to the TCP data input. The event is received and I see it in the Splunk UI in real time. The only problem being that it's still encoded (see image). Typically when I get errors with SSL there is some obscure error relating to truncation attacks or Cipher Suites but I didn't seem to get any errors.\n  ![screen shot 2016-03-01 at 5 21 54 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11302527/13444066/2357d1e2-dfd2-11e5-8150-9684b7299a6d.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/190934511/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/190970047","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/233#issuecomment-190970047","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/233","id":190970047,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MDk3MDA0Nw==","user":{"login":"JPercivall","id":11302527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzAyNTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11302527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall","html_url":"https://github.com/JPercivall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-01T23:41:23Z","updated_at":"2016-03-01T23:48:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Whenever an SSL context is being created (done 4 times in multiple different classes) \"SSLContextService.ClientAuth.REQUIRED\" is used.

I have a few comments about the most recent changes:\n\n##### Tests\n- The unit tests are much improved.  Your mock implementation is better than my suggested approach, and there has been a big improvement in code coverage as a result.\n- I think we could use one or two mocked tests for GetDynamoDB.\n- Test coverage for unprocessed items is low, given that your design targets the batch get/put/delete APIs and unprocessed items will be expected.  Earlier today, I thought that would be easily fixed.  It turns out I don't have solid knowledge of what unprocessed responses will really look like in practice, and the AWS SDK is more confusing than helpful.\n\n##### AbstractWriteDynamoDBProcessor\n\nAbstractWriteDynamoDBProcessor has two methods - handleUnprocessedPutItems and handleUnprocessedDeleteItems - and two subclasses, PutDynamoDB and DeleteDynamoDB.  I know that isn't how things started a couple weeks ago, it used to be shared code, but isn't this a sign that we don't need an AbstractWriteDynamoDBProcessor?  Can we just move those methods to their respective processors, or do you anticipate sharing them with additional writing processors?\n\n##### Relationships\n\nWhat types of relationships have you considered besides \"success\" and \"failure\"?   A malformed input \"failure\" requires correction before retrying, but unprocessed item failures might simply be retried.  Also, GetDynamoDB might have a separate relationship for \"not found\" as opposed to \"failure\".  On the good side, your inclusion of complete response codes in the output attributes makes it possible to filter out the various failure modes.  Additional relationships could be added as features later.\n\nI am still working on setting up some tests for unprocessed items.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/192777256/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/192800737","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/233#issuecomment-192800737","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/233","id":192800737,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MjgwMDczNw==","user":{"login":"bbende","id":605416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTQxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende","html_url":"https://github.com/bbende","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-06T04:01:29Z","updated_at":"2016-03-06T04:01:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@JPercivall Pushed up a commit that addresses your comment about Client Auth being required, and I think I also fixed the race condition on the RELP test.

My only question is regarding the extraction of the boolean check for `UserGroupInformation.isSecurityEnabled()` in [`HBase_1_1_2_ClientService.java`](https://github.com/rickysaltzer/nifi/blob/6dc8416b7f2cb5480a6f6ae63777ea4080263e67/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-standard-services/nifi-hbase_1_1_2-client-service-bundle/nifi-hbase_1_1_2-client-service/src/main/java/org/apache/nifi/hbase/HBase_1_1_2_ClientService.java) on line 137. I'm not completely familiar with the HBase components, but my understanding is that this will now be executed statically at the class initialization time, rather than during the `customValidate` method call. Is this intentional?\n\nAs for @bbende , I think Groovy tests allow for easier static mocking, but I do not consider it a priority for this PR. I think the existing unit tests @rickysaltzer added are sufficient (although perhaps with a perfunctory check of the error message/cause after the `runner.assertNotValid(service);` just to ensure it's not accidentally testing something else.  \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/194012946/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/194026785","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/253#issuecomment-194026785","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/253","id":194026785,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5NDAyNjc4NQ==","user":{"login":"rickysaltzer","id":347356,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NzM1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/347356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickysaltzer","html_url":"https://github.com/rickysaltzer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickysaltzer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickysaltzer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickysaltzer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickysaltzer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickysaltzer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickysaltzer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickysaltzer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickysaltzer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickysaltzer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-08T23:42:19Z","updated_at":"2016-03-08T23:42:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@alopresto The `UserGroupInformation` is all referenced statically, and before my changes the `UserGroupInformation.isSecurityEnabled()` method was called at the time of `customValidate`.

I recommend we change proper case \"Not Found\" to lowercase \"not found\" to fit in.\n- Description of REL_UNPROCESSED in AbstractDynamoDBProcessor does not clarify why items are unprocessed.  I recommend something like:\n  \n  > FlowFiles are routed to this relationship when DynamoDB does not process them in the batch.  Typical reasons are insufficient table throughput capacity and exceeding the maximum bytes per request.  Unprocessed FlowFiles are expected to be retry-able without modification.\n- `@Ignore` was commented out on ITPutGetDeleteGetDynamoDBTest.java, line 31, so the integration tests are trying to run.  I think this is bothering TravisCI, when it's not running out of memory.\n- GetDyanmoDB @CapabilityDescription does not specify where the data goes.  Also, there is a misspelling \"parimary\".  I recommend something like the following:\n  \n  > Retrieves a document from DynamoDB based on hash and range key. The key can be string or number. For any get request all the primary keys are required (hash or hash and range based on the table keys).  A Json Document (\"Map\") attribute of the DynamoDB item is read into the content of the FlowFile.\n- PutDynamoDB @CapabilityDescription, same issue.  I recommend:\n  \n  > Puts a document to DynamoDB based on hash and range key. The table can have either hash and range or hash key alone. Currently the keys supported are string and number and value can be json document. In case of hash and range keys both key are required for the operation. The FlowFile content must be JSON.  FlowFile content is mapped to the specified Json Document attribute in the DynamoDB item.\n- Commit 51448fb introduced a single-space whitespace inconsistency in GetDynamoDB.java, line 114 \"final String jsonDocument = ...\"\n\nYeah, I think we're down to the whitespace issues.

Overall, it looks good and I was able to test a flow successfully putting to a Kinesis Firehose which aggregated and dumped to S3.\n\nOne thing that was mentioned prior in my initial review that we still need to cover is that of how we are handling batching.  I do think we need to handle that in a more constrained fashion given that file sizes could vary widely.  With how the processor is currently configured, it could hold up to 250MB in memory, by default.  Instead, what would your thoughts be on converting this to a buffer size property.  If people want batching, they can specify a given memory size (perhaps something like 1 MB by default) and then we can wait until that threshold is hit or no more input flowfiles are available, at which point they are sent off in a batch.  If batching is not desired, they can either empty the buffer property or specify 0 bytes.\n\nThoughts on this approach?  Ultimately, we are trying to avoid people from incidentally causing issues with heap exhaustion.  With the prescribed approach here, people can get as aggressive as they wish with batching and have a finitely constrained amount of space per
