So I was hoping you could help with some advice.\r\n> > ` // org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.parser.AstBuilder\r\n> > val sourceTableAlias = getTableAliasWithoutColumnAlias(ctx.sourceAlias, \"MERGE\")\r\n> > private def getTableAliasWithoutColumnAlias(\r\n> > ctx: TableAliasContext, op: String): Option[String] = {\r\n> > if (ctx == null) {\r\n> > None\r\n> > } else {\r\n> > val ident = ctx.strictIdentifier()\r\n> > if (ctx.identifierList() != null) {\r\n> > throw new ParseException(s\"Columns aliases are not allowed in $op.\", ctx.identifierList())\r\n> > }\r\n> > if (ident != null) Some(ident.getText) else None\r\n> > }\r\n> > }`\r\n> \r\n> I think we can support this feature only for spark2 currently.

I was running the reproduction, after casting the `hoodie_is_deleted` field to Boolean, as well as making it `nullable=True` I was still seeing a couple of issues, would be glad to get some thoughts on this.\r\n\r\nThe first issue is when using the `master` branch and running the notebook example above, I saw that the end result was :\r\n```\r\n\r\n+-------------------+------------------+-----------------+\r\n|_hoodie_commit_time|_hoodie_is_deleted|committed_records|\r\n+-------------------+------------------+-----------------+\r\n|20210812183614     |false             |20               |\r\n```\r\nmeaning that the record is still not getting deleted. \r\n\r\nIn the older hudi releases, like hudi 0.7.0 the end result after after making all the rows have`hoodie_is_deleted` set to false is this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n+-------------------+------------------+-----------------+\r\n|_hoodie_commit_time|_hoodie_is_deleted|committed_records|\r\n+-------------------+------------------+-----------------+\r\n|20210812183614     |false             |19             |\r\n```\r\nSo its able to do the delete the record in 0.7.0, but not master which is odd even though the example is the same.\r\nThe second issue is that in `0.7.0` if we dont specify `hoodie_is_deleted` for existing records, the final end result is this ( Unless this is expected behavior?)\r\n```\r\n+-------------------+------------------+-----------------+\r\n|_hoodie_commit_time|_hoodie_is_deleted|committed_records|\r\n+-------------------+------------------+-----------------+\r\n|20210812212528
