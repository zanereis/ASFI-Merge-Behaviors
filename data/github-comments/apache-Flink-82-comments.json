Do you think it would be possible to track the update frequency of buckets and only flush the bucket with the least updates (or n buckets with least updates)? This might improve the performance for skewed input data.\n\nIf we flush only some of the elements when the memory is full, then the append position of the record area doesn't change, but only some holes appear in the record area, so we immediately need to do a compaction. Since the compaction traverses the entire table, this idea could only work if we flush a substantial amount of the elements (like half of them).\n\nThis is an interesting idea, but I'm finding it quite hard to form even just an intuitive understanding about its performance effects. I mean doing this would have some overhead, and at the moment I totally can't see how much skew in the data would make this worth it (or what percentage of the data should be flushed at a time, etc.).\n\nI'll think about this some more, but getting right the trade-offs here would probably require quite a lot of work: experimentation with different variants of the algorithm, with differently skewed data, with different `distinct keys / total number of input elements` ratios, so we should probably postpone this to some later time, after this basic version is merged.\n\n> I agree that the sort-based strategy for reduce combiners can be removed eventually, when the hash-based strategy proves to work well.

There is a flag called `buildsideOuterJoin` in `MutableHashTable`, all the extra effort only happens while `buildSideOuterJoin` is true.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/173151704/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/173212170","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1524#issuecomment-173212170","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1524","id":173212170,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MzIxMjE3MA==","user":{"login":"uce","id":1756620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTY2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1756620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce","html_url":"https://github.com/uce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-20T14:00:09Z","updated_at":"2016-01-20T14:00:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hey Klou! Nice addition. A couple of users have asked for this. I guess they will be happy. I made some minor comments inline. The changes look good, I haven't tested it yet manually, but I've noticed that there are no test cases. I think we should add a simple test that ensures the basic expected behaviour (use default scheme is file, use default scheme if specified, don't use default scheme if explicit in URI etc.) After adding the tests and trying it out manually, I think it will be good to merge.

the required parameters, because they make the code too clumsy.\nI also think that getting rid of all these static variables and methods is a great improvement in readability. Users new to Flink should be able to focus on understanding the Flink's APIs and abstractions and not be distracted by our examples.\n\nI'm not saying you need to accept or take over my changes.

I changed the code according to your suggestion and got an error associated with the `hint` type.  \n\nFirst, I assumed to add a line \n\n``` scala\nval sizeHint = resultParameters.get(SizeHint).get\n```\n\nbefore the \n\n``` scala\nval crossTuned = sizeHint match {...\n```\n\nclause.

I'm not sure what is the best practice here.  I see a couple of less-than-ideal options:  (1) create a new PR with updated directory structure, which is not ideal (2) pull the master branch, merge with this branch, but then when I commit and push here many, many commits will be added not relevant to this PR when I merge (less ideal...).  \n\nOn a smaller note, I see your point @chiwanpark about raising the flag earlier with the choice of metric and using a quadtree.  Do we want to do this in `fit` though?  In `fit`, I can get the metric and the parameter `useQuadTree`, but if the user does not specify `setUseQuadTree`, then I have a conservative test that will use the quadtree if no value is passed, but this test makes use of the number of training and test points.   Is it OK to put the flag in `predictValues` instead where all the variables needed -- metric, training  and test sets -- have been passed?  Otherwise I will have to re-factor the code more, for example the test set is now passed into `predictValues` and will have to be passed into `fit` which is not ideal.\n\nI changed the format based on @chiwanpark 's suggestion to make it look like what @tillrohrmann suggested.  \n\nI committed and pushed the code if you'd like (added a knn.md file in docs, but that is still very much a work in progress :-) \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/174329818/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/174369547","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1220#issuecomment-174369547","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1220","id":174369547,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3NDM2OTU0Nw==","user":{"login":"chiwanpark","id":1941681,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDE2ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1941681?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark","html_url":"https://github.com/chiwanpark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-25T01:48:27Z","updated_at":"2016-01-25T01:49:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi @danielblazevski, you don't need to open a new PR and merge master branch.

Currently, the error will be raised in doing cross operation because checking metric is in `minDist` method of `QuadTree` class. I would like to check this metric conflict before doing operation. It is best to add a method like `checkQuadTreeConflict` in `KNN` class and call it in `setUseQuadTree` and `setDistanceMetric` method or call it in anyway before doing operation.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/174369547/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/174438711","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1537#issuecomment-174438711","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1537","id":174438711,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3NDQzODcxMQ==","user":{"login":"gyfora","id":5880972,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODA5NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5880972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora","html_url":"https://github.com/gyfora","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-25T08:44:25Z","updated_at":"2016-01-25T08:44:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks good to me!\nThis is a critical fix :+1: \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/174438711/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/174439774","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1542#issuecomment-174439774","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1542","id":174439774,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3NDQzOTc3NA==","user":{"login":"gyfora","id":5880972,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODA5NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5880972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora","html_url":"https://github.com/gyfora","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-25T08:49:56Z","updated_at":"2016-01-25T08:49:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This seems to be straightforward :) Looks good :+1: \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/174439774/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/174446152","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1537#issuecomment-174446152","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1537","id":174446152,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3NDQ0NjE1Mg==","user":{"login":"rmetzger","id":89049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger","html_url":"https://github.com/rmetzger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-25T09:23:55Z","updated_at":"2016-01-25T09:23:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I tested this as well.

for this PR @ChengXiangLi.\n\nThis PR assumes that the code generation happens during the Calcite translation process, because the interfaces return concrete DataSet function objects. This differs from the original design document where code generation would happen in the next step, i.e., when translating the Flink RelNodes into a DataSet program.\n\nInstead of returning the DataSet functions, we could also return Calcite RexNodes (Calcite's expression trees) and generate code from that. The RexNode representation is very similar to the original TableAPI Expression representation. So porting the existing code should be rather straightforward.\n\nIMO, generating the code later would be be better separation of issues.

So that we could replace Calcite easily at any time.

The idea is good, but I think it needs a bit of improvement:\n- The value is pulled in a fairly complicated way though all the layers and abstractions. That is not really necessary, as soon as it is in the `ExecutionConfig`, the `Task` can access the values. No need to change the TaskDeploymentDescriptior, JobGraph, ExecutionGraph, etc. This probably needs changes in 2 files (otherwise, our abstractions are messed up).\n- `taskCancellationDelay` is not a very intuitive name, in my opinion. It suggests that cancellation is delayed, which is not the case. Tasks are actually canceled a single time, the blocked threads are only repeatedly interrupted.\n- We should not try to show off such parameters in the examples. The examples need to stay simple, or we confuse people with parameters they need usually not worry about.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/174518267/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
