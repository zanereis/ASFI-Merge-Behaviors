Erjan,\r\n\r\nAlthough I do like functionality added, I am not sure if this can be accepted to Celix. \r\n\r\nFirst of IANAL. But if I am correct, by adding a GPL piece of code or dependency you are creating a 'derivative work' of the GPL code and the GPL requires that all 'derivative work' should be shared. If this feature is enabled, this then also holds for all Celix users.\r\n \r\nWith LGPL this is only true for code based on the LGPL code, not for code which only uses the LGPL code (e.g. use the LGPL part as as a shared lib dependency).  \r\n\r\nThe (core) Celix framework is currently only dependent on the libc, uuid, curl and zlib. For linux, if I am correct, this means:\r\n- glibc (LGPL)\r\n- libuuid (BSD, from util-linux)\r\n- zlib (zlib license, permissive license)\r\n- libcurl (MIT/X)\r\n\r\nNote that these are permissive licenses or LGPL. Although it would be nice to completely avoid the LGPL dependencies this is not always feasible. \r\n\r\nIf you like, we can discuss this further on the celix dev mailling list. But for now I cannot accept this pull request.\r\n\r\nPepijn","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/comments/276011110/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/comments/276359601","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/celix/pull/17#issuecomment-276359601","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/17","id":276359601,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NjM1OTYwMQ==","user":{"login":"ErjanAltena","id":5460392,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NjAzOTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5460392?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ErjanAltena","html_url":"https://github.com/ErjanAltena","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ErjanAltena/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ErjanAltena/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ErjanAltena/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ErjanAltena/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ErjanAltena/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ErjanAltena/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ErjanAltena/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ErjanAltena/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ErjanAltena/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-31T13:14:14Z","updated_at":"2017-01-31T13:14:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"SInce I understand the legal issues with using a GPL licensed library I will close this pull request.

We follow the gifflow workflow, which means the master branch points to the last release and is not a branch for active development.

The update SHM discovery uses the discovery webserver, and as such is not strictly based on shared memory anymore. I think we need a solution that does not require any web technology, and that this discovery should still use shared memory.\r\n\r\nI do think it makes sense to use the XML format, and as such I think we should split the current discovery into a endpoint handling and a separate transport part. Than the endpoint handling can be reused, and a new transport can be added for SHM. This also makes it possible for different solutions wrt discovery.\r\n\r\nThis can leave the basic architecture intact, where the discovery itself is \"discovered\" through any other means, and only after this discovery a direct communication is in place for retrieving the endpoints. But where needed/possible on mechanism can be used for both. I think that for SHM both solutions are possible.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/comments/536193256/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/comments/536194158","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/celix/issues/78#issuecomment-536194158","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/78","id":536194158,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNjE5NDE1OA==","user":{"login":"rlenferink","id":10008950,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDA4OTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10008950?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlenferink","html_url":"https://github.com/rlenferink","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlenferink/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlenferink/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlenferink/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlenferink/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlenferink/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlenferink/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlenferink/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlenferink/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlenferink/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-28T14:24:05Z","updated_at":"2019-09-28T14:24:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"_Comment by @pnoltes:_\r\n\r\nYes remove the manifest from bundle.\r\n\r\nAlthough manifest headers should be retrievable by the bundle api (see https://osgi.org/javadoc/r6/core/index.html) storing a bundle at the bundle revision is more logical.\r\nthe bundle api retrieve it's manifest info from the current bundle revision.
