Switch to the next segment in `FileWriteAheadLogManager#restoreWriteHandle` if failover iteration stops on `SWITCH_SEGMENT_RECORD`.\r\n2. Create a flag `WalIterator#switchSegmentRecordReached` to implement 1.\r\n\r\nLooks like we have 2 cases when we stop iteration, not on `SWITCH_SEGMENT_RECORD`:\r\n\r\n1. Segment is full and `SWITCH_SEGMENT_RECORD` doesn't fill in it - then it doesn't matter when archivation happens, we will have a consistent segment in the archive.\r\n2.

Thanks for comments, I refactored code and make it more clear:\r\n1. Move all reducers to separate package, make PageStream, NodePageStream top level classes;\r\n2. Remove custom logic from NodePageStream (now it just wrapper over PageStream with single node) and leverage on PageStream only. It also helps to simplify logic of MergeSortReducer;\r\n3. Reworked CacheQueryReducer interface: added callback methods (onError, onCancel, onFinish), removed/renamed and fixed doc for unclear methods, moving some methods to top level hierarchy class.\r\n\r\nCould you please review PR again?

WDYT?\r\n\r\nCurrently, `CommandProcessor` class supports two types of commands: instances of `SqlCommand` (ignite-core classes) and instances of `GridSqlStatement` (ignite-indexing classes). For some reason (unknown to me) `CREATE/DROP TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE ADD/DROP COLUMN`, and some other commands were implemented as `GridSqlStatement`, such commands can't be used by the calcite engine without additional references to the ignite-indexing module. Commands like `CREATE/DROP INDEX`, `ALTER TABLE LOGGING/NOLOGGING`, `CREATE/DROP/ALTER USER`, `KILL ...` and some other were implemented as `SqlCommand`, to support such commands in calcite engine we only need to add corresponding grammar and sql-to-cmd converter.\r\nSo, we should move the `CREATE/DROP TABLE` command to the core module first (make it instance of `SqlCommand`) to be able to use it in `NativeCommandHandler`. Perhaps such refactoring should be done in the master branch to avoid merge conflicts.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/comments/865013760/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/comments/865024393","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ignite/pull/9176#issuecomment-865024393","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/9176","id":865024393,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2NTAyNDM5Mw==","user":{"login":"korlov42","id":52168184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTY4MTg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52168184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/korlov42","html_url":"https://github.com/korlov42","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/korlov42/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/korlov42/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/korlov42/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/korlov42/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/korlov42/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/korlov42/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/korlov42/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/korlov42/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/korlov42/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-21T13:15:51Z","updated_at":"2021-06-21T13:15:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":">
