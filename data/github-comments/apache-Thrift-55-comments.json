Actually, the thrift project has quite a few test suites:\r\n\r\n1. There are unit tests available for the Rust crate\r\n2. There is a \"kitchen-sink\" test that allows you to build a client/server pair, and allow you to manually run through a battery of tests\r\n3.

If you can totally use the existing API to implement it that would be awesome (I imagine you at least need to add new constructors to `TDeserializer` to take the field maps you want to partially deserialize). If you can't, I think it's fine to add new APIs for it as long as the new API design makes sense, but the new API should be more similar to the existing `TDeserializer` API, unless we have a good reason to make it quite different (e.g. the current TDeserializer API is bad/inefficient/etc. because of X Y Z).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/918752362/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/923282614","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/2455#issuecomment-923282614","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/2455","id":923282614,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAS9U843CCy2","user":{"login":"fishy","id":78183,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MTgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/78183?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy","html_url":"https://github.com/fishy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-20T20:43:23Z","updated_at":"2021-09-20T20:43:23Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Looks like we disabled travis, but I verified this locally with `make check` under `lib/go` and `test/go`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/923282614/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/931797936","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/2439#issuecomment-931797936","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/2439","id":931797936,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAS9U843ihuw","user":{"login":"bhalchandrap","id":79821958,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODIxOTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79821958?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhalchandrap","html_url":"https://github.com/bhalchandrap","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhalchandrap/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhalchandrap/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhalchandrap/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhalchandrap/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhalchandrap/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhalchandrap/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhalchandrap/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhalchandrap/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhalchandrap/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-01T00:23:50Z","updated_at":"2021-10-01T00:23:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@fishy thanks for the earlier suggestions.

But not sure it's a common problem for all languages, so `no_sparse` is not implemented. I will remove it from the feature matrix.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/946430113/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/948233344","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/2440#issuecomment-948233344","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/2440","id":948233344,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAS9U844hOSA","user":{"login":"kainjow","id":271035,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MTAzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/271035?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kainjow","html_url":"https://github.com/kainjow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kainjow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kainjow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kainjow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kainjow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kainjow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kainjow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kainjow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kainjow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kainjow/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-21T03:49:26Z","updated_at":"2021-10-21T03:49:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> TNonblockingServerSocket\r\n\r\nDone!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/948233344/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/949003828","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/2469#issuecomment-949003828","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/2469","id":949003828,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAS9U844kKY0","user":{"login":"Jens-G","id":5834733,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MzQ3MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5834733?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G","html_url":"https://github.com/Jens-G","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-21T21:07:37Z","updated_at":"2021-10-21T21:07:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Re \"sparse\": It was not about the feature, but about terminology.
