Rohit,\n\nI changed the db.properties last night and from the 3 builds 1 was successful (job 30.1).

thanks!\n\nPersonally I think just having it on master is ok -- anyone that is likely to run into this issue is also likely to have configuration management (like chef) in place to edit their

I went through the logs and saw that the problem is related to a method that should be implemented in the basic network class, and used by the advanced net class as well.\n\nUnfortunately, the dhcp rules are in the wrong place so we get the glitch.\n\nI did only advanced zone tests because I saw the whole basic zone tests in Marvin, it's a shame they are not being executed by Travis.\n\nThis week I'm on a course, but once back will have a look.\n\nThe error message from the log\n\nDhcpForSubnet not implemented in Basic Network Topology.\n\nCheers,\nWilder\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\nOn 16 Sep 2014, at 17:19, \"Rohit Yadav\" <notifications@github.com<mailto:notifications@github.com>> wrote:\n\nThanks for this Wilder. I skimmed the code and it was alright. To test, I've a KVM host and I tried to deploy basic zone with SG.

I tested the built systemvms from http://jenkins.buildacloud.org/job/systemvm-refactor-CLOUDSTACK-7143/9/\n on KVM using both master and 4.4 branch as my systemvms were unable to connect to mgmt server.\n\nAt first, I was getting KVM clock error exceptions which I solved by disabling it from agent.properties (http://cjkz.wordpress.com/2014/08/08/apache-cloudstack-kvmclock-error/).\n\nSo after spending last few hours debugging them, I see the following from VNC/KVM:\n![screen shot 2014-09-22 at 3 16 49 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/95203/4356589/de713d9a-425a-11e4-9767-a3cba9c8c887.png)\n\nIt looks like the disk is corrupt for some reason, so to test the image I used the new KVM template to deploy a VM on another CloudStack deployment which perfectly worked for me. So, I'm guessing something in the KVM iso/patching process is messing with the systemvm. Now every time CloudStack tried to do HA and re-deploys systemvms I get the above on my test environment.\n\nCan you please try this at your end using KVM or Xen and let me know if it works for you?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/56371520/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/56373578","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/16#issuecomment-56373578","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/16","id":56373578,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MzczNTc4","user":{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-09-22T13:38:56Z","updated_at":"2014-09-22T13:38:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I manually ran fsck on failing partitions of the systemvm and rebooted, then it worked for me.\n\n![screen shot 2014-09-22 at 3 35 03 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/95203/4356869/a65971cc-425d-11e4-907f-a54b3a9d7439.png)\n\n@lsimons I think the issue is probably how we're partitioning and if we're cleanly shutting down the VM before exporting it in various formats?

@bhaisaab,\n\nThis is a new Pull Request in order to fix the conflicts we found in the old pull request #19 .\n\nTravis-CI is 100% green and this PR has been extensively tested.\n\nI will put the most update version of the description here:\n\nPull request of changes in the \"cloud-server\" module\n\nIn the last 14 weeks we have worked in the cloud-server, focusing our time in the refactor of the \n![puml_routerdeployment](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5129209/4531522/04b0ad16-4d8b-11e4-9c9f-493f71c9e88e.png)\n[Vpc]VirtualNetworkApplianceManagerImpl. We had a mains goals increase of Maintainability, Extensibility, Readability and test coverage. That was just a first step towards the development, still in progress, of the Redundant Virtual Routers for VPC.\n\n== What has been done so far:\n\n• The VirtualNetworkApplianceManagerImpl class line numbers dropped from 4440 to 2558\n• The VpcVirtualNetworkApplianceImpl class line numbers dropped from 1484 to 749\n• We created 35 new classes in order to split the code/responsibility\n• We added 97.8% unit test coverage for com.cloud.network.element/router and org.cloud.network.router.deployment packages\no The most complex classes we changed are in those packages\no About 1700 lines of unit tests\n• We executed many Marvin tests that we got from ACS and made compliant with our domain:\no test_01_create_account\no test_01_add_vm_to_subdomain\no test_DeleteDomain\no test_forceDeleteDomain\no test_updateAdminDetails\no test_updateDomainAdminDetails\no test_updateUserDetails\no test_LoginApiDomain\no test_LoginApiUuidResponse\no test_privategw_acl\no test_01_reset_vm_on_reboot\no test_03_restart_network_cleanup\no test_05_router_basic\no test_06_router_advanced\no test_07_stop_router\no test_08_start_router\no test_09_reboot_router\no test_01_create_service_offering\no test_02_edit_service_offering\no test_03_delete_service_offering\no test_01_start_stop_router_after_addition_of_one_guest_network\no test_02_reboot_router_after_addition_of_one_guest_network\no test_04_chg_srv_off_router_after_addition_of_one_guest_network\no test_05_destroy_router_after_addition_of_one_guest_network\no test_01_stop_start_router_after_creating_vpc\no test_02_reboot_router_after_creating_vpc\no test_04_change_service_offerring_vpc\no test_05_destroy_router_after_creating_vpc\no test_vpc_remote_access_vpn\no test_vpc_site2site_vpn\n\nWe started the changes in the network area, trying to identify the differences in the 2 types of network we have. For that we created Basic and Advanced Network Topology classes. The network topology classes are responsible by invoking the Apply/Setup/Create/Save rules that were previously done by the [Vpc]VirtualNetworkAppliance. A topology instance is retrieved via a context object that is injected in the [Vpc]VirtualElement. The context object will return the most appropriate topology instance based on the Network Type, which is defined in the Data Centre. That was the first step towards the refactor.\n\nFrom the topology class we reach the Rule Applier implementation that will be used to do all the rule setup preparation (i.e. invoke DAOs and prepare the command object). The RuleApplier interface was extracted from the VirtualNetworkApplianceManagerImpl, where it use to be an inner interface. For each anonymous implementation of the RuleApplier we created a concrete class. The rules are used as elements of a Visitor class, which will perform some extra logic, depending on the rule it's visiting, and call the send commands to router method. The latter has also been extracted from the VirtualNetworkApplianceManagerImpl and is now in a new helper class: NetworkHelperImpl.\n\nThe visitor has been used because we were aiming to split the responsibility and also because the way the RuleApplier was implemented before, it was clear that every command sent to the router was following a 2-steps approach: gather information to create the commands, apply some logic to send to the router. For those reason we implemented the visitor pattern. Since we already had the Basic/Advanced Network Topology classes, we created 2 concrete classes to visit the rules: Basic/Advanced Network Visitors. Both classes extend the abstract class NetworkTopologyVisitor, which defines all the visit methods per type of rule. By doing so, we can use the same rule and separate the logic based on the type of visitor that we have - Basic or Advanced.\n\nContinuing on the refactor, we also added some helper classes for the \"getSomething\" related methods. Following this approach we ended up having the following classes:\n\n• NetworkHelper (interface)\n• NetworkHelperImpl\n• VpcNetworkHelperImpl\n• CommandSetupHelper\n• NicProfileHelper\n• RouterControlHelper\n\nLast, but not least - and actually the most crucial part of the code - there was also a huge refactor in terms of how the routers are deployed. The previous deployeRouter and deployVpcInrouter methods do not exist any more. Instead of having the logics spread, or sometime tangled, in the [Vpc]VirtualNetworkApplianceManagerImpl, we have created a Router Deployment Definition mechanism, with classes that follow the same naming convention. The deployment definition has 2 implementations, Router and Vpc router, which are created with the aid of a Builder class. Most of the work, which is common to both implementation, is being done by the RouterDeploymentDefinition class. The specific bits are done by their implementation. for example, when findOrDeployVirtualrouter() method is called, it will make sure that precondition are checked, deployment plan is done and generated and executed. The implementation will vary according to the Deployment Definition instance we have: Router or VpcRouter.\n\nAlthough it looks like a huge change in the ACS cloud-server core, we kept most of the original code. Ou mains focus in this first step was to restructure it and make it better to understand. We have excessively tested our tested via Unit Tests, integration tests and also manually in order to have the 100% confidence to push the code towards the upstream branch.\n\nPlease, if you have doubts/suggestions/change requests, do not hesitate to contact us. Also feel free to improve the code we change in any aspect you think it's necessary, but do not forget to share with the community your reasons for doing so.\n\nThe Redundant VPC subject has been discussed in a few threads in the last months:\n\nWorking on CloudStack Jira-764:nTier Apps 2.0 : Redundant Virtual Router for VPC email 2 of 2 http://markmail.org/message/56xrscvnmdweoxf5\nredundant virtual routers for VPCs: http://markmail.org/message/w4ow3ddcpxsic7g6\nAdding Redundant Routers to VPCs: http://markmail.org/message/hcay37lvfaev6wqw\nLook to hear your feedback.\n\nWith kind regards,\nWilder Rodrigues\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/58073492/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/58321537","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/22#issuecomment-58321537","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/22","id":58321537,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MzIxNTM3","user":{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-10-08T07:42:18Z","updated_at":"2014-10-08T07:42:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for sharing Wilder, I'll review some of pending PRs today.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/58321537/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/58321829","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/22#issuecomment-58321829","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/22","id":58321829,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MzIxODI5","user":{"login":"wilderrodrigues","id":5129209,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMjkyMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5129209?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues","html_url":"https://github.com/wilderrodrigues","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-10-08T07:45:22Z","updated_at":"2014-10-08T07:45:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks, Rohit!\n\nI also saw your reply on the list.
