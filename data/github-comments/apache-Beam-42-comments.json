unit tests fail on Jenkins due to misconfiguration and unexpected host name resolution in that environment (builds.apache.org label beam). `InetAddress.getLocalHost()` returns valid resolvable `InetAddress`, but that address is not among interfaces that network server that binds to 0:0:0:0 listens to. Here is an output of few commands:\n\n```\nInetAddress.getLocalHost():\n214.175.197.104.bc.googleusercontent.com/104.197.175.214\n\nhostname\njenkins-beam2.apache.org\n\nhostname -i\n104.197.175.214\n\nhostname -I\n10.128.0.2 172.17.0.1 \n```\n\nNote that `InetAddress.getLocalHost()` result is not the same as the output of `hostname`. IP address provided by `hostname -i` is not among addresses returned by `hostname -I`. And the issue seems to start from the fact that `hostname` returns name that resolves to an external IP address (docker host?) with reverse DNS pointing to

@tgroh (initially)\n\nThe TypeDescriptor could be an alternative field/in addition to the Coder, where you add an `Optional<TypeDescriptor<T>>` field to the `Values` PTransform. The Coder need not be available at transform creation time but at transform apply time, at which point you have access to the Pipeline (and can perform coder inference)\n\nAdding this method should also remove the ability to call `Create.of()` - as such, `Create.of(T...)` should be changed to `Create.of(T, T...)` to ensure that there is always at least one element or a Coder has been provided, and `Create.of(Iterable<T>)` should add a `checkArgument(!Iterables.isEmpty(elems))`\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/243832664/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
