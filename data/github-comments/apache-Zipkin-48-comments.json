This helps to make use of the 256KB message cap that SQS imposes and reduces API calls.  The SQS collector only reads as fast as the storage layer accepts writes.  For our use case SQS is effectively an off memory buffer just as Kafka would be.\r\n\r\nLooking at the MySQLSpanConsumer I don't see any fixed 6KB limiting logic.  It might be possible to introduce some logic to dynamically adjust the batch size to some tunable value though.\r\n\r\nIf your stuck with MySQL for storage and your using HTTP as the transport layer I would probably consider augmenting writes with SQS or Kafka just to avoid spikes in traffic from overwhelming your storage layer.\r\n\r\nBeyond tuning batch inserts for a specific storage component, I don't think there is much benefit in Zipkin server buffering anything since there are much better solutions such as SQS, Kafka or a more scalable storage layer.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/270476634/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/270532737","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1457#issuecomment-270532737","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1457","id":270532737,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MDUzMjczNw==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-05T00:59:34Z","updated_at":"2017-01-05T00:59:34Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"thanks

The linked spans work could pick up from there.\r\n\r\nI've added a demo in Brave: https://github.com/openzipkin/brave/tree/master/brave/src/test/java/brave/features/async\r\nAnd I've also verified the dependency graph pretty-much works as-is:\r\nhttps://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/1478\r\n\r\nI know the clock skew adjuster will change, but it will be less work than adding new annotations, as it already special cases skew found when \"sr\" happens before \"cs\".\r\n\r\nI thought that it might break single-host spans in the dependency graph until I realized that single-host spans are already broken! In other words, regardless of one or two-way, the dependency graph would need code anyway.\r\n\r\nSo summary is that we should forget about \"ms\"->\"mr\" and go with \"cs\"->\"sr\", which reduces work on all parties to support this feature.

The reason is that the current approach uses the two views of duration in the same span to interpret skew. Since async would have only a single view of latency, it won't work. This means either people need to keep their clocks in sync, or they need to resolve skew as a part of the reporting pipeline somehow.\r\n\r\nThe problem will be the same regardless of which annotations are used except in the case where messaging is implemented under the covers as normal RPC.

With that point of view in mind, being required to add endpoint to\r\nall spans feels laborious and inefficient. This has led to people asking to\r\nchange the model. I've gone down this path, too, though in the process have \r\ngrown an appreciation for the existing model. Here's why:\r\n\r\n* RPC spans require no navigation to see the parties involved\r\nIf you look at the span data presented by the Zipkin api, when RPC data is\r\ngrouped into a span, it is very easy to tell the timeline of activity between\r\nthe client and the server. The UI takes advantage of this implicitly. When you\r\nclick on a span, you automatically see the causal events in the same place:\r\na client request caused the server response. When client and server are reported\r\ninto different span IDs, there's a higher tooling burden. Ex I find it very hard\r\nto compare timestamps when they are nested into different json objects. Other\r\ntools like clock skew adjusters would have a different burden than today, too.\r\n\r\n* RPC spans permit third parties\r\nWhen modeling ancillary behavior, such as an intermediary, the current span\r\nmodel offers more options. For example, a reverse proxy could note a passthrough\r\nevent with annotations as opposed to a new span. The code is more simple to do\r\nthis, and the result would end up in the same json/UI panel. On the other hand,\r\nmost tools are not written assuming there's N members in the same span: The\r\napproach of starting a new span for an instrumented proxy is still preferred,\r\nregardless of whether the proxy's span is propagated to the caller or not.\r\n\r\n* RPC spans will exist for a while!\r\nEven if we move to single-host spans, and address tooling gaps, we have to\r\nexpect dual-host spans to coexist for a while. This means the canonical model\r\neither needs to synthesize fake spans from multiple host ones, or work with both\r\nmodels indefinitely. Synthesized Ids are mostly harmless, but not 100% harmless.\r\nIt is likely that someone will question a span ID that never existed.\r\n\r\nWhere to go from here?\r\n\r\nIt seems most sensible to formalize a reporting representation even if the real\r\nmodel needs to address multi-host for a while. The reporting representation can\r\nbe translated into the old one, and may eventually become its own model. In the\r\nmean time, there's a backlog of work needed to really support single-host spans.\r\nThis includes making the UI detect RPCs that span different IDs, backfilling\r\ntests and logic for clock skew correction and dependency linking, and probably\r\nother things. Once the whole system works with single-host spans, we could then\r\nconsider formalizing it as the \"one model\", and switch storage etc accordingly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/271492810/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/271494939","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1480#issuecomment-271494939","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1480","id":271494939,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MTQ5NDkzOQ==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-10T06:10:26Z","updated_at":"2017-01-10T06:10:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"cc @openzipkin/instrumentation-owners @fedj @openzipkin/core @cburroughs @rogeralsing","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/271494939/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/271567054","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1481#issuecomment-271567054","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1481","id":271567054,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MTU2NzA1NA==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-10T12:48:54Z","updated_at":"2017-01-10T12:48:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"thanks for writing this up @fedj.

The performance penalty for individual services is usually negligible (YMMV depending on instrumentation and/or throughput), and since we don't have to funnel all spans to a collector but rather do all our distributed tracing analysis via searches and reports from the log aggregator there's no performance concern on the collector. Of course there's a monetary cost in our case for having the log aggregator pick up every span from the logs, but so far the tradeoff has been worth it for us. You'll have to weigh all the performance and monetary tradeoffs yourself to see what will work best in your situation, but before assuming tracing every request will be too much of a performance burden I'd recommend doing some performance testing. You might be pleasantly surprised.\r\n\r\nWe have our services return the trace ID in the response headers so that if we run into a request that took too long or had an error or otherwise needs investigation we can dig into it immediately. When investigating these issues the question is almost always \"what log messages are associated with this request (trace ID)?\", not \"what log messages are associated with this small portion of the request (span ID)?\". That's why we've only worried about spitting out trace ID for every log message, not span ID. That said, it might be a good idea to spit out both trace ID *and* span ID for every log message. I just wouldn't recommend outputting *only* span ID - it's likely to be much less useful in general.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/272549794/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/272580656","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1486#issuecomment-272580656","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1486","id":272580656,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MjU4MDY1Ng==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-14T00:02:59Z","updated_at":"2017-01-14T00:02:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"thanks, lance. will look into it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/272580656/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/272583557","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/1487#issuecomment-272583557","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1487","id":272583557,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MjU4MzU1Nw==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-14T00:24:58Z","updated_at":"2017-01-14T00:24:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for digging into this.\r\n\r\nso before, people used `/api/v1/trace/my-id?raw` to debug data (as that skips adjustment).

We sometimes get people asking about various\naspects of azure. Ex\nhttps://groups.google.com/d/msg/zipkin-dev/bTBKUEjLtKg/yLbvVkFYAQAJ for\nstorage\n\nThere are two alternate collector projects:\n\nhttps://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-aws < for amazon components, notable\nSQS\nhttps://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/stackdriver-zipkin <- actually more\na storage bridge to Google Stackdriver\n\non SDK vs small internal library\n\nZipkin-aws uses the Amazon SDK to access SQS, though that may not always be\nthe case. There are pros and cons to using an SDK for something like\npulling from a queue. For example, usually the SDKs have quite a lot of\ndependencies, and the act of pulling from a queue is a simple rest call.\nMoreover, the rest calls involved in collections are usually extremely\nstable apis. Additional dependencies can often complicate interactions with\nexisting code, and they typically not easy to instrument, for example\ninternal debugging we call \"self-tracing\". On the other hand, sometimes\nSDKs are directly integrated in Spring Boot, which could cut down work.\nAlso, SDKs often help with platform-specific concerns. For example,\nAmazon's includes the ability to refresh credentials which is not\ntechnically difficult, but work better deferred until it has to be\nchanged.  In the zipkin-aws project, code currently seems better off using\nAmazon's SDK than not, so that's why it does!\n\nback to the point..\n\nAnyway, when making a zipkin-azure, I'd make the SDK an internal detail, in\ncase it needs to change later, and follow the same pattern as zipkin-aws as\nthat's almost exactly the same interaction you've mentioned. You can\nprobably ping @llinder for advice, too. In both projects mentioned, there's\na separate docker image at the moment, though we've regularly discussed a\n\"layer\" approach which could make it possible to add something like Azure\nEventHub to an existing container.\n\nnext steps (imho)..\n\nThe key next steps would be to look at the existing projects, and introduce\nyourself in gitter, as that's where we chat\nhttps://gitter.im/openzipkin/zipkin\nThen, decide whether you want to make this third-party or not. For example,\nzipkin-aws is released in the openzipkin org, which means a few of us can\nrelease it. Outside the zipkin org, you would be responsible for\ndetermining your own path, for example, Google have their own continuous\nintegration and release setup (which seems to work well). Regardless, you'd\nwant to make sure that there's some user who can vet that the result works.\nFor example, one common problem with new code is that it is only used by\nthe author. If you find a user or another stakeholder, the work will be\nmore sustainable.\n\nHope this helps!\n-A\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/272752829/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/272753197","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1488#issuecomment-272753197","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1488","id":272753197,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3Mjc1MzE5Nw==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-16T01:12:29Z","updated_at":"2017-01-16T01:12:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"ps totally missed that there was a link in your description!\nhttps://github.com/aliostad/zipkin-collector-eventhub\n\ncool that the collector work is in progress.

It is a better representation when you primarily deal with one host, which is the case with tracers.\r\n\r\nex. when we write a client tracing code, we might now do the following\r\n```\r\nsetType(client)\r\nstart()\r\naddTag(\"http.path\", \"/foo\")\r\nsetRemoteService(remoteService)\r\nfinish()\r\n```\r\n\r\nto map that to the existing span model, it becomes\r\n```\r\naddAnnotation(startTimestamp, \"cs\", localService)\r\naddAnnotation(endTimestamp, \"cr\", localService)\r\naddBinaryAnnotation(\"http.path\", \"/foo\", localService)\r\naddBinaryAnnotation(\"sa\", true, remoteService)\r\n```\r\nit is very awkward to explain ^^ in docs..\r\n\r\nusing the span model proposed it becomes\r\n```\r\nsetType(client)\r\nsetLocalService(serviceOfTracer)\r\nsetRemoteService(remoteService)\r\nsetTimestamp(startTimestamp)\r\nsetDuration(endTimestamp - startTimestamp)\r\naddTag(\"http.path\", \"/foo\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think the better is a better representation *for tracers to use* because...\r\n* it is less jargony (tags vs \"binary annotations)\r\n* it is simpler (string -> string, as opposed to list (string, blob, type, endpoint)\r\n* it is less chatty (no needless repetition of the same endpoint on every annotation or binary annotation.\r\n* it removes ambiguity (sometimes people use the wrong binary annotation type)\r\n\r\nAll these things feed into easier understanding and docs when writing tracers. That means less support time, and people setup for success as opposed to confusion. We'll have less people with bugs (ex where they leave out binaryannotation.host which happens), because such bugs are now impossible.\r\n\r\nBrown field tracers do not need to change. People who already learned the existing format can run with it. The winners here are new users and people who support zipkin. We make it easier for new tracers to get started. We offer them a simplified upload format, devoid of nuanced traps or cognitive burden.\r\n\r\nThe cost of doing this is a parser on the server-side. This is primarily collectors (ex we can say only http and kafka) which accept the simplified format. In the OpenApi/swagger spec, for example, we'd define an alternate supported representation, over the same endpoint or over a different one. It can coexist and I think it is worth the work if the only beneficiary was documentation and new users.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/273696144/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/273699030","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/939#issuecomment-273699030","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/939","id":273699030,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MzY5OTAzMA==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-19T07:14:57Z","updated_at":"2017-01-19T07:14:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"note to all in the thread :)\r\n\r\nthis issue was created because zipkin v2 never happened as it had too much scope.

Right now we make a fat jar by depending on zipkin and our extra auto configuration libs.  From there we create a new layer on the zipkin docker container by exploding the fat jar in the same way the upstream build does.  This is  fairly easy though it does make the container larger than needed since the old layer still remains.\r\n\r\nIdeally we need to figure out an elegant way to only layer in new jars.  Both the property launcher and thin launcher sound promising though I don't have experience with either so I'm anxious to see what the developer experience would be like.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/273845411/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/273870645","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1453#issuecomment-273870645","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1453","id":273870645,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3Mzg3MDY0NQ==","user":{"login":"nicmunroe","id":15578205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTc4MjA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15578205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicmunroe","html_url":"https://github.com/nicmunroe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicmunroe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicmunroe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicmunroe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicmunroe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicmunroe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicmunroe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicmunroe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicmunroe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicmunroe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-19T19:17:24Z","updated_at":"2017-01-19T19:17:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@guettli yes it is easy to get the trace ID from span ID, but it's an extra hop that is not needed the vast majority of the time (at least in our experience - YMMV). And like I said, I think it's a good idea to log both.\r\n\r\nAvoiding redundancy (\"don't repeat yourself\", or DRY) is good for mainline code, but it's not a mantra that should be blindly followed in all cases. For example, IMO in unit tests it's more important to have the tests be readable and understandable (and therefore maintainable) than it is to wipe out all redundancy. It's a balancing act. If DRY-ing up your unit tests makes them difficult to understand for other people (or yourself in 6 months) then you've probably gone too far. See [this stackoverflow question/answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6453235/what-does-damp-not-dry-mean-when-talking-about-unit-tests) for a good overview of this idea.\r\n\r\nIn regards to logging trace ID and span ID - it might be sort of redundant to log both since you can technically get to trace ID from span ID but the drawback is nil (a few extra bytes per log message) and it doesn't hurt maintainability since it's just logs (the usual reason for DRY-ing mainline code), so might as well log both.\r\n\r\nOf course that's all just my opinion. If you're unsure, try both ways and see which makes more sense for your use cases.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/273870645/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
