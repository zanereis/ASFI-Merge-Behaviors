The difference between fixed point and integer is that fixed point has fractional part while integer does not. By adding \"point position (pp)\" and adding dtype to quantization pass, we could reuse most of quantization API for the same matter. Of course, the TVM compute needs to be modified based on the value of the position. For example, aligning the pp before doing add operation; updating the pp after multiplication. In addition, I think it might not be good to have \"func, params = relay.frontend.from_mxnet(block, shape_dict, \"fxp16_13\")\" which means all models flows with same pp. Are you considering different pp in each layer since the precision loss and overflow may have impact on accuracy.

Where IRModule could contain functions with an explicit compiler annotation, so and a specific compiler is invoked. I can imagine us handling this in the compile_engine, so that the caller do not have to worry about the extern vs non-extern.\r\n> \r\n> This is something that we might be able to separate out as another PR\r\n\r\nThanks for pointing this out. This is also something we were trying to achieve and the external codegen (xxCodegen.cc) exactly looks like that. I agree that putting the codegen logic in GraphRuntimeCodegen is not clean. But it seems that compile_engine does not really need to do much (or even anything) for external functions. I was thinking that we can probably just have a packed function, `CompileExternalFuncs` (could be in compile_engine), and pass all collected external functions to it to generate runtime modules. We only need to collect these functions from GraphRuntimeCodegen and VMCompiler when traversing the AST. Does this sound good to you?\r\n\r\n> ## Graph Partition and Annotation\r\n> The graph partition and annotation should be a pass that takes IRModule->IRModule, which then makes use of the data.\r\n\r\nYes, they are IRModule->IRModule.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/561502307/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/561503961","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4459#issuecomment-561503961","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4459","id":561503961,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MTUwMzk2MQ==","user":{"login":"tobegit3hub","id":2715000,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MTUwMDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2715000?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobegit3hub","html_url":"https://github.com/tobegit3hub","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobegit3hub/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobegit3hub/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobegit3hub/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobegit3hub/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobegit3hub/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobegit3hub/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobegit3hub/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobegit3hub/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobegit3hub/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-04T06:52:02Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T06:52:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It

Other things:  IsLattice\r\nThe basic usage is just:\r\n```cpp\r\ntemplate <typename T>\r\nstruct STD_SET_IS_LATTICE : public IsLattice<std::set<T>> {\r\n  using SET = std::set<T>;\r\n  public:\r\n     SET join(const SET& a, const SET& b);\r\n     SET meet(const SET& a, const SET& b);\r\n     const SET& top();\r\n     const SET& bottom();\r\n     bool equal(const SET& a, const SET& b);\r\n     static const STD_SET_IS_LATTICE<T>& __ops() {\r\n       static const STD_SET_IS_LATTICE<T> op;\r\n       return op;\r\n     }\r\n     static const STD_SET_IS_LATTICE<T>& ops = STD_SET_IS_LATTICE<T>::__ops();    \r\n};\r\n```\r\nand when trying to make things concrete, you can try to declare something like `class X : ffdfa<std::set, STD_SET_IS_LATTICE , STD_SET_IS_LATTICE::ops>` . \r\n\r\n### Other things: A Concrete computing example for Live Variable Analysis\r\n\r\nTo make the proposal more understandable, we compute on a concrete example, on a program given as below:\r\n```python\r\nBlock1\r\n    a = b\r\n    Block2\r\n        If (iszero b)\r\n            then x = 1\r\n            else x = 2\r\n        c = x + 2\r\n # {} as Alive, at the exit point of ASTNode Block1\r\n```\r\nNote that we will calculate, the live variables at entry/exit point for each ASTNode (except for variables to not disrupt the format).\r\n\r\nWe know at the end there is no live variable, and due to the recursive calls, this empty set will be \r\npropagated up to the exit points of Block2 and Statement `c = x+2`(the leaf of the AST):\r\n```python\r\nBlock1\r\n    a = b\r\n    Block2\r\n        If (iszero b)\r\n            then x = 1\r\n            else x = 2\r\n          # {x} as Alive -- exit point of If Statement\r\n          # {x} as Alive -- entry point of 'c=x+2'\r\n        c = x + 2\r\n          # {}  as Alive -- exit point of 'c=x+2'\r\n      # {}  as Alive -- exit point of Block2 \r\n  # {}  as Alive -- exit point of Block1 \r\n```\r\nA single assignment statement will change live variable accordingly, and due to how `Block` is dealt with, the exitpoint of IfStatement will have the same value as the entry point of the following statement. \r\n\r\nIfStatement is dealt with according to the pseudo-code, and note that the conditional will have its information as well. \r\n\r\nReflecting from that pseudo-code, because `LiveVariableAnalysis Conditional AfterCondition` is evaluated, and MemorizedVersion will record all the input and output of the `LiveVaraibleAnalysis` call once evaluated, so this conditional will be a key in the cache dictionary.\r\n\r\nAt the end, it will be the following:\r\n```cpp\r\n  # {b} as Alive, entry of Block1, since recursion directly propagate it up\r\nBlock1\r\n      # {b} as Alive, entry of 'a = b'\r\n    a = b\r\n      # {b} as Alive, exit of 'a = b'\r\n      # {b} as Alive, entry of Block2, since recursion directly propagate it up\r\n    Block2\r\n          # {b} as Alive, entry of If Statement\r\n              # {b} as Alive, entry of '(iszero b)'\r\n        If (iszero b)\r\n              # {} as Alive, exit of '(iszero b)'\r\n                 # {} as Alive, entry of 'x=1'\r\n            then x = 1\r\n                 # {x} as Alive -- exit of 'x=1'\r\n                   # {} as Alive, entry of 'x=2'\r\n            else x = 2\r\n                   # {x} as Alive -- exit of 'x=2'\r\n          # {x} as Alive -- exit point of If Statement\r\n          # {x} as Alive -- entry point of 'c=x+2'\r\n        c = x + 2\r\n          # {}  as Alive -- exit point of 'c=x+2'\r\n      # {}  as Alive -- exit point of Block2 \r\n  # {}  as Alive -- exit point of Block1 \r\n

This can be avoided by fusing padding to the preceding op, and padding can be implemented by some offset output writing.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/562413289/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/562414322","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/4471#issuecomment-562414322","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4471","id":562414322,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MjQxNDMyMg==","user":{"login":"apivovarov","id":218087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxODA4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/218087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov","html_url":"https://github.com/apivovarov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-06T03:12:29Z","updated_at":"2019-12-06T03:12:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"haha.

@junrushao1994 ,\r\n    an over-simplified example from the industrial context is the following:\r\n```python\r\n...\r\nB0 = tvm.compute((m,n), lambda i,j: A0[i,j] + 2*A1[i,j], name = \"B0\")\r\nC0 = tvm.compute((m,n), lambda i,j: A0[i,j] + 2*A1[i,j], name = \"C0\")\r\nD0 = tvm.compute((m,n), lambda i,j: B0[i,j] + 3*C0[i,j], name = \"D0\")\r\n...\r\n```\r\nThe customized TVM will schedule and use `compute_at` to the extreme, and transform into something like \r\n```cpp\r\n...\r\nfor (i, 0, m) {\r\nfor (j, 0, n) {\r\n        B0[0] = (A0[((i*stride) + (j*stride))] + (2f*A1[((i*stride) + (j*stride))]))\r\n        C0[0] = (A0[((i*stride) + (j*stride))] + (2f*A1[((i*stride) + (j*stride))]))\r\n        D0[((i*stride) + (j*stride))] = (B0[0] + (2f*C0[0]))\r\n}}\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis gives our 'incomplete' CSE and Copy Propagation a chance to make the C0 assigned by B0 and replace C0’s appearance in D0 into B0 and make C0 dead (or not? dependent on the future).\r\n```cpp\r\n   ...\r\nfor (i, 0, m) {\r\nfor (j, 0, n) {\r\n        B0[0] = (A0[((i*stride) + (j*stride))] + (2f*A1[((i*stride) + (j*stride))]))\r\n        C0[0] = B0[0]\r\n        D0[((i*stride) + (j*stride))] = (B0[0] + (2f*B0[0]))\r\n}}\r\n   ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThe above ‘incomplete’ CSE and Copy Propagation pass can do things safely in a straight-line code in a small range (without data-flow analysis), but the same thing did not happen for dead code elimination – if we don’t know any live information out of this for loop, we cannot just eliminate the assignment to C0[0].\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, dead code can arise after copy propagation and how dead code arises in TVM is similar to how they arise in LLVM and traditional compiler passes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/562559678/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/562625577","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/4473#issuecomment-562625577","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4473","id":562625577,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MjYyNTU3Nw==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-06T15:47:33Z","updated_at":"2019-12-06T15:47:33Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks

Instead it modifies torch script to use existing TVM functions.\r\n- torch-tvm uses relay to represent subgraphs and then dynamically builds functions rather than using prebuilt libraries as proposed here.\r\n\r\nI understand that the current implementation is the shortest path to getting tvm functions working in TensorFlow and that a torch-tvm approach would be a much larger undertaking. However, I don't think it will be able to scale well. The use of prebuilt libraries means there will be a lot of back and forth between regular tvm and tensorflow-tvm during development, and it seems like developers would be better off just importing their tf model to relay and doing everything within tvm. Contrast this to the torch-tvm approach where all the tvm magic happens transparently, making it very straight forward for pytorch users.\r\n\r\nWe should also consider where the code belongs. I personally prefer having projects like torch-tvm and tf-tvm being separate from the main tvm repo if possible as it we already are dealing with frontend bloat.\r\n\r\nAll that said, I think something like tf-tvm is a great idea and something we should work towards. I just want to make sure we make the first step carefully.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/562681167/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/562693190","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4447#issuecomment-562693190","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4447","id":562693190,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MjY5MzE5MA==","user":{"login":"apivovarov","id":218087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxODA4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/218087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov","html_url":"https://github.com/apivovarov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-06T18:50:42Z","updated_at":"2019-12-06T18:50:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM\r\n@FrozenGene Can you have a look?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/562693190/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/562783833","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/4471#issuecomment-562783833","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4471","id":562783833,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2Mjc4MzgzMw==","user":{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-06T23:41:03Z","updated_at":"2019-12-06T23:41:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Could you verify if it works?

This is a real problem happening in the industrial context. The current solution is either over-conservative or unsound. \r\n\r\n  About the name of \"Data-flow Analysis\", I think it is more a terminology question. For example the CFA is also a kind of program analysis but I don't think that is expressible in this framework or required in TVM IR (since there is not even first class function in TVM IR). Also I am not sure if this is expressible enough for **all** of the program analysis. Program Analysis is a really broad field.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, this framework can express most of the Data-flow Analysis phrased in the format of fixpoint computation in the first chapter of

Analysis*.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/562806258/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/562826046","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/4468#issuecomment-562826046","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4468","id":562826046,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MjgyNjA0Ng==","user":{"login":"comaniac","id":8262694,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNjI2OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8262694?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac","html_url":"https://github.com/comaniac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-07T07:54:55Z","updated_at":"2019-12-07T07:54:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@DKXXXL
