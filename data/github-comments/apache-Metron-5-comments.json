I would suggest bouncing the enrichment topology to ensure that stale data in the caches get flushed, but that is not strictly necessary.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/222364875/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/222400667","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/131#issuecomment-222400667","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/131","id":222400667,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMjQwMDY2Nw==","user":{"login":"james-sirota","id":4854764,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NTQ3NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4854764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-sirota","html_url":"https://github.com/james-sirota","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-sirota/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-sirota/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-sirota/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-sirota/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-sirota/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-sirota/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-sirota/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-sirota/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-sirota/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-30T02:35:32Z","updated_at":"2016-05-30T02:35:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"+1.

May be worth taking out the stop, but that could affect the Monit stuff on initial deployment.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/224432106/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/224473351","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/146#issuecomment-224473351","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/146","id":224473351,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNDQ3MzM1MQ==","user":{"login":"mmiklavc","id":658443,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODQ0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/658443?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc","html_url":"https://github.com/mmiklavc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-08T02:47:40Z","updated_at":"2016-06-08T02:47:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Tested on full-dev-vagrant - verified indexes are populating.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/224473351/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/224569359","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/145#issuecomment-224569359","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/145","id":224569359,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNDU2OTM1OQ==","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-08T12:05:36Z","updated_at":"2016-06-08T12:05:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The problem was that the template load was attached to the 'enrichment' host group.

The role names include `metron` indicating that the role specifically affects the deployment of core Metron.\n2. The names center around a core Hadoop-y service so that, for example, if we need to add additional functionality that impacts Elasticsearch we can throw it into the same `metron_elasticsearch` role and the name still makes sense.\n\nI could certainly be persuaded that METRON-212 is better though.

Having a targeted domain\nspecific language is going to be a lot simpler to parse than something more\ncomplex like groovy (or javascript for that matter).  It's hardly even a\nDSL, frankly, just the ability to compose functions, which seems like a\nsweet spot between the expressivity and complexity.  The other reason I like a simple DSL\nwith just function composition is that I'd _really_ prefer to not give\nusers enough rope to hang themselves with here if we can help it.  This DSL\nreally exposes only the things you can do in one line of code.  If it's\nmore than one line of code, we should be considering that a feature in the\nlanguage.\n\nIf we really want to integrate a scripting engine in the future, we can\ncreate a separate FieldTransformer to do it in just one class.\n\nOn Mon, Jun 13, 2016 at 9:38 AM, Nick Allen notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> Love the functionality that you are creating with this.
