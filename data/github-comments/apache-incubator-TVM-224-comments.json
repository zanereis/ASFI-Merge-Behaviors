Globally registered packedfunc will be preserved\r\n\r\nThis is what I thought initially, but something weirder is going on. The globally registered packedfunc works when you run the test script on its own (without pytest). But when running under pytest, the registered functions cannot be found. I commented about it in the source code: \r\n```\r\n# tkonolige: The issue as I understand it is this: multiprocessing's spawn\r\n # method launches a new process and then imports the relevant modules. This\r\n # means that all registered functions must exist at the top level scope. In\r\n # this file they are, so all is well when we run this file directly.\r\n # However, when run under pytest, the functions aren't registered on the\r\n # server. I believe this is because pytest is also using multiprocessing to\r\n # run individual functions.

However, my point is since we haven't fully released auto_scheduler and the total number of auto_scheduler PRs is just a few, it should be easy to identify the PR that changes the certain behavior (in fact, since currently only a few people using the upstream auto_scheduler, I don't think this would be an issue for now). IMHO, it's fine to follow this principle after auto_scheduler is able to perform end-to-end tuning on all three platforms (x86, ARM, NVIDIA GPU). Meanwhile, my primary concern of separating changes to many small PRs is that it will slower the auto_scheduler upstream process due to the high CI traffic.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/723687040/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/723707565","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/6884#issuecomment-723707565","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6884","id":723707565,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyMzcwNzU2NQ==","user":{"login":"Light-of-Hers","id":39763024,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzYzMDI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39763024?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Light-of-Hers","html_url":"https://github.com/Light-of-Hers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Light-of-Hers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Light-of-Hers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Light-of-Hers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Light-of-Hers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Light-of-Hers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Light-of-Hers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Light-of-Hers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Light-of-Hers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Light-of-Hers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-09T01:44:47Z","updated_at":"2020-11-09T01:46:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tqchen Here is an example.

But later i resolved to re-utilize the existing Op, in order to enable reuse of small portion of code and it bind the concept of Op together too. But i am in favor of 'dense_sparse' Op as well(But that would be the name for existing Op i think :slightly_smiling_face: ). However i think we do not have much impact on the schedule side, in between these 2 flavor of Ops.\r\n\r\nBut the utilizing Op with transpose, i felt we are adding additional overhead every-time may not be much in smaller matrix. \r\nPlease let me know your thoughts on this.

In particular, rather than switching the behaviour of ScheduleGetter with a flag it may make more sense to simply provide an alternative ScheduleGetter for the auto-scheduler. With a 'TETranslator' de-coupled, we should be able to avoid duplicating lots of code. What are your thoughts?\r\n\r\nThis PR can definitely work with #6888 to have a more concise implementation. However, this PR needs more than a TE translator, and that's why I exposed it first to have more discussions instead of waiting for #6888. Although we might be able to simplify the changes of `compile_engine.cc` in this PR with the TE translator, other changes in this PR (e.g., add a flag to graph runtime codegen and many other places) are still required. Thus, we can still work in parallel, and modify the later merged one accordingly to achieve the same goal.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/726264707/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/726287978","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6907#issuecomment-726287978","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6907","id":726287978,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyNjI4Nzk3OA==","user":{"login":"giuseros","id":2017147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTcxNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2017147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/giuseros","html_url":"https://github.com/giuseros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giuseros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giuseros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giuseros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giuseros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giuseros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giuseros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giuseros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giuseros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giuseros/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-12T19:23:51Z","updated_at":"2020-11-12T19:23:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"cc @mbaret @u99127 @anijain2305 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/726287978/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
