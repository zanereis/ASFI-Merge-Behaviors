String dates are indeed\nidiomatic. Worth re-stating the rationale, since this issue is fairly\nspecial case. For example, it is making a shortcut form of the existing\nmodel (and would need to port without lossiness to the old one)\n\nHere's some things to think about.\n\nEverything currently uses the epoch micros, so it directly translates\nacross. For example, when querying back (or looking at stored data) you\nwould see the exact numeric form reported).\n\nDate formats usually don't have microsecond precision, either.\n\nUsing a date format opens up to people in the N languages with\nuncoordinated tracers putting in an incorrect format (which we would\nimmediately unwind it back into an epoch time). We'd get all the fun with\npeople accidentally putting wrong timezone etc which I'm sure many of us\nare familiar with.\n\nOn 53bits. that's a known constraint wrt timestamps (our ids don't use\nnumeric form for this reason). Ex our current json parser guards on 53bits\nwhich if I'm not mistaken puts the Y2K problem at the year 2255. While\nthat's a punt for sure, since data is usually retained at a few days,\nsometime between now and 2255 I'm sure we'd have a new overall format.\n\nStatus quo does include the typical problem of people making ad-hoc or new\ntracers accidentally put epochMillis where they meant epochMicros. This is\nvery easy to detect and fix. Heck we could probably even log it since when\nthis mistake occurs the timestamps would look like they are from 1970. In\nother words, we can help make developing easier by making a development\nmode of zipkin which would crash POST on upload lint problems, such as 1970\ndates.\n\nThoughts?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/274223881/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/274223999","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1499#issuecomment-274223999","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1499","id":274223999,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NDIyMzk5OQ==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-21T01:53:18Z","updated_at":"2017-01-21T01:53:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"ps

Here is what I get:\r\n\r\n``` shell\r\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.IllegalStateException: No 'loader.main' or 'Start-Class' specified\r\n\tat org.springframework.boot.loader.PropertiesLauncher.getMainClass(PropertiesLauncher.java:317)\r\n\tat org.springframework.boot.loader.Launcher.launch(Launcher.java:50)\r\n\tat org.springframework.boot.loader.PropertiesLauncher.main(PropertiesLauncher.java:521)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd if so,  I guess it should be from zipkin-server?\r\n\r\nUsing `java -jar` works but does not load my stuff.\r\n\r\nPS. Sorry for asking many questions... I am actually pleased I have made it this far. With little background soon will be publishing my contribution 👍 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/274750627/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/274753903","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1488#issuecomment-274753903","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1488","id":274753903,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NDc1MzkwMw==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-24T09:36:30Z","updated_at":"2017-01-24T09:36:30Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@aliostad so keep in mind this is using the default zipkin exec jar (which has the start class).

It also makes writing instructions less complex, and reduces the surface area of bugs and troubleshooting.\r\n\r\nFurther, this has been requested only once, which puts it more in the category of \"how do I work around this\" until it becomes more popular or broadly worth it.\r\n\r\nThe key here is how to affect the formatter, which is currently an intentionally hidden detail. We have multiple ways to address this, depending on how things are deployed. For example, we could expose the type and allow someone to override it by adding a jar to the classpath. Another way would be to tighten up the format expression prefix such that the whole thing could be overridden (avoiding a \"whack-a-mole\" problem of introducing a parameter and then later another similar one). Finally, we don't have to expose whatever we do as an env variable, as we could leave it to spring boot defaults which can also be set via properties (essentially as discouraged config).\r\n\r\n@ImFlog all the above are just brainstorming, and no way mean I don't want to help. I also appreciate you both describing the use case and raising a potential approach. Before we commit to this (no pun intended), can you describe how you deploy zipkin?
