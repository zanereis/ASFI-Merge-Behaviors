In my humble opinion, these do not aid the reader at all. On many occasions I look at 15 lines of code and notice they compress to 5.

The problem is that my laptop is M1 Pro based, so a global build of Pinot fails on it.

If a simple method doesn't fit on a screen without scrolling, it's unreadable. I've proposed using checkstyle to ban blank lines within functions to @Jackie-Jiang to help specifically with this case, but he wasn't too keen on the idea and reasoned that the _occasional_ blank line can help readability.\r\n> > Regarding M1s, I think @dongxiaoman uses M1 and managed to build Pinot, maybe he can help?\r\n> \r\n> Thanks, I will check with @dongxiaoman.\r\n> \r\n> I would argue that the spacing around blanks is a subjective thing, unless somebody is putting 3 blanks consecutively (in which case, our check style does catch it).\r\n> \r\n> Beyond that, the definition of readability is YMMV. As long as it is not obviously and immediately evident that something is broken, we should IMO not let subjectivity take control\r\n\r\nThis is not a subjective matter but a question of how much code fits on screen. Objectively, given finite screen space, large numbers of blank lines will prevent methods from fitting on screen at some point. One method in this PR contains 15 blank lines.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1014591577/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1014598892","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/8030#issuecomment-1014598892","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/8030","id":1014598892,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c48eYzs","user":{"login":"richardstartin","id":16439049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDM5MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16439049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin","html_url":"https://github.com/richardstartin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-17T14:23:27Z","updated_at":"2022-01-17T14:23:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Is there a way to test this?

We're discussing adding configuration overrides to QuickStarts as another PR. We're still sorting out the best design philosophy for this, as configuration keys are applied to separate components. I think ideally we would be able to provide an easier zero-downtime configuration manager, such as using a config server with auto-refresh scope. This would allow a user to use a git repository as a way to version control and manage configurations for each of the different components.

This is going to be super useful. I am wondering if we can have the option to set certain parameters as well to make debugging using Quickstart easier:\r\n> \r\n> CommonConstants.java: public static final long DEFAULT_BROKER_TIMEOUT_MS = 10_000L public static final long DEFAULT_QUERY_EXECUTOR_TIMEOUT_MS = 15_000L\r\n> \r\n> * setting to higher value will prevent execution from terminating while debugging using Quickstart.\r\n> \r\n> Also, if possible: QueryException.java: private static int _maxLinesOfStackTracePerFrame = 5;\r\n> \r\n> * setting to higher value while launching quickstart will allow for seeing full stack trace in console when query fails.\r\n\r\nWe should add support for quickstart to take extra configs or a config file to override existing configs. E.g. enabling grpc or auth for quick test.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1015816584/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1015825289","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/8031#issuecomment-1015825289","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/8031","id":1015825289,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c48jEOJ","user":{"login":"kbastani","id":2095770,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTU3NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2095770?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbastani","html_url":"https://github.com/kbastani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbastani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbastani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbastani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbastani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbastani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbastani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbastani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbastani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbastani/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-18T20:54:10Z","updated_at":"2022-01-18T20:56:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mr-agrwal Here is a workaround until @KKcorps implements basic authorization in the JDBC spec.
