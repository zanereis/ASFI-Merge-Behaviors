I'd suggest find the all the needed hudi configs for your application based on deltastreamer's params and create a map of hudi write options from scratch, then pass it to datasource writer. The extra work is you may need to do some orchestration for your datasource writer like schedule it periodically and trigger compaction in a separate process. Not all deltastreamer params match to hudi write options like --continuous is for orchestration mode not writer option. So deltastreamer is at higher level than datasource writing you can't flip them.\r\n3. see 2)\r\nHope this

Hereunder please find an updated detailed explanation.\r\n\r\n### Current Setup\r\n**Input Data**\r\n- Avro Files\r\n- 25MB each\r\n- 250 / 6GB per day\r\n\r\n**Resources**\r\n_Tried various configurations and this is the most solid and performant given the available hardware_\r\n\r\n- num-executors 19 \r\n- executor-cores 1 \r\n- executor-memory 6g\r\n\r\n**Spark Configurations**\r\n_Various options and values were tried out but performance change was minimal_ \r\n- spark.default.parallelism (currently using 200)\r\n- repartition on inputDF (currently using 1,000)\r\n- spark.executor.memoryOverhead (using default value)\r\n\r\n**Hudi Configurations**\r\n_Still work in progress on optimising this part as there might be other options which may help boost performance_\r\n- hoodie.datasource.write.operation: UPSERT\r\n- hoodie.upsert.shuffle.parallelism: 1000 (tried lower values but performance suffered a bit)\r\n- hoodie.datasource.write.row.writer.enable: true\r\n\r\n**Performance & Notes** \r\n- the entire process to upsert one day of data into an existing Hudi table (which is not particularly large) is taking around 20 minutes\r\n- whatever parameters we seem to tweak, some stages still have a large amount of spillage and thus slowing down the application (see screen-shot hereunder)\r\n- data is being 'compacted' using a simple NiFi flow merging the raw incoming data from Kafka\r\n- data seems to be skewed and thus not easy to partition using a field and ensuring even distribution\r\n\r\n\r\n**Deltastreamer**\r\nWe had given this a shot in the past but had various issues with types in the schema. In addition, we wanted a solution which would allow us to have more control and custom operations on the incoming data before persisting it to Hudi. We really wanted to go for this option but we simply did not see how it was possible and thus we opted to build our own Spark streaming application that fits our use case. \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91965061/138274415-bb5adf7f-0d80-4575-ab2b-c85e739d49c0.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91965061/138275319-f733e82e-e2d8-4cde-9a9b-1b45c30a7854.png)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/948557950/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/948575260","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/3842#issuecomment-948575260","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3842","id":948575260,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM44ihwc","user":{"login":"hudi-bot","id":79415918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDE1OTE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79415918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/hudi-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-21T12:40:33Z","updated_at":"2021-10-23T07:25:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\nMeta data\n{\n  \"version\" : 1,\n  \"metaDataEntries\" : [ {\n    \"hash\" : \"dd8a1a3d0ca0dc0d8b83e252227b1de25e7e17af\",\n    \"status\" : \"DELETED\",\n    \"url\" : \"https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=2774\",\n    \"triggerID\" : \"dd8a1a3d0ca0dc0d8b83e252227b1de25e7e17af\",\n    \"triggerType\" : \"PUSH\"\n  }, {\n    \"hash\" : \"a2e5859250562c77c534b5b98df177a011675c35\",\n    \"status\" : \"DELETED\",\n    \"url\" : \"https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=2778\",\n    \"triggerID\" : \"a2e5859250562c77c534b5b98df177a011675c35\",\n    \"triggerType\" : \"PUSH\"\n  }, {\n    \"hash\" : \"cf6826fd108bd639db7b85df7ee66144cce3ea66\",\n    \"status\" : \"DELETED\",\n    \"url\" : \"https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=2783\",\n    \"triggerID\" : \"cf6826fd108bd639db7b85df7ee66144cce3ea66\",\n    \"triggerType\" : \"PUSH\"\n  }, {\n    \"hash\" : \"03416a0ec1874ac842c526b80d0ca7490c7ea43c\",\n    \"status\" : \"SUCCESS\",\n    \"url\" : \"https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=2808\",\n    \"triggerID\" : \"03416a0ec1874ac842c526b80d0ca7490c7ea43c\",\n    \"triggerType\" : \"PUSH\"\n  } ]\n}-->\n## CI report:\n\n* 03416a0ec1874ac842c526b80d0ca7490c7ea43c Azure: [SUCCESS](https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=2808) \n\n<details>\n<summary>Bot commands</summary>\n  @hudi-bot supports the following commands:\n\n -

Caller usually don't know the internals of abstract class interfaces and cannot decide when to use what lock/unlock versions. \r\n\r\nThe core problem here is nested transactions (and there by lock reentrancy). Few higher level actions have sub actions and taking the same exclusive lock across actions can lead to deadlock. Instead of viewing this as implementation specific (lock) issues, can we see this as transaction manager issue? That is a higher level transaction started doesn't want to start sub transactions, right? If thats the case, can we instantiate the Rollback/Clean sub actions with no-op transaction manager? Because the transaction manager in these actions have the only task of locking/unlocking and so the presence of Transaction manager can inform indirectly inform them to relax transaction and there by the locking. Please let me know if I got the core problem wrong?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/950218626/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/950245793","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/3844#issuecomment-950245793","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3844","id":950245793,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM44o5mh","user":{"login":"YannByron","id":10036681,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDM2Njgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10036681?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannByron","html_url":"https://github.com/YannByron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannByron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannByron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannByron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannByron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannByron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannByron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannByron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannByron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannByron/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-24T01:52:03Z","updated_at":"2021-10-24T01:52:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@hudi-bot run azure","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/950245793/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/950272720","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/3840#issuecomment-950272720","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3840","id":950272720,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM44pALQ","user":{"login":"kywe665","id":1703248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDMyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1703248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kywe665","html_url":"https://github.com/kywe665","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kywe665/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kywe665/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kywe665/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kywe665/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kywe665/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kywe665/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kywe665/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kywe665/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kywe665/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-24T07:04:35Z","updated_at":"2021-10-24T07:04:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Awesome suggestions @Limess.
