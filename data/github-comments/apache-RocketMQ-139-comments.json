I think neither are good solution. Use retry topic just want to find the broker address. Maybe we can solve like this:\r\n```java\r\nCollection<BrokerData> values = this.examineBrokerClusterInfo().getBrokerAddrTable().values();\r\n        for (BrokerData value : values) {\r\n            String addr = value.selectBrokerAddr();\r\n            if (StringUtils.isNotBlank(addr)) {\r\n                ConsumerConnection result = this.mqClientInstance.getMQClientAPIImpl().getConsumerConnectionList(addr, consumerGroup, timeoutMillis);\r\n                if (result != null) {\r\n                    return result;\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1376636692/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1376653849","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/5844#issuecomment-1376653849","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/5844","id":1376653849,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl85SDhIZ","user":{"login":"ShadowySpirits","id":32436597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDM2NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32436597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShadowySpirits","html_url":"https://github.com/ShadowySpirits","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShadowySpirits/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShadowySpirits/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShadowySpirits/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShadowySpirits/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShadowySpirits/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShadowySpirits/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShadowySpirits/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShadowySpirits/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShadowySpirits/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-10T02:51:05Z","updated_at":"2023-01-10T02:51:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The broker creates the retry topic automatically when a consumer first sends a heartbeat.\r\n\r\nsee ClientManageProcessor#heartBeat:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/rocketmq/blob/a68078fef8315a0deeae32af42a029ccd2fa76a4/broker/src/main/java/org/apache/rocketmq/broker/processor/ClientManageProcessor.java#L112-L117","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1376653849/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1376675574","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/5844#issuecomment-1376675574","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/5844","id":1376675574,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl85SDmb2","user":{"login":"RongtongJin","id":21963954,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTYzOTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21963954?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin","html_url":"https://github.com/RongtongJin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-10T03:21:43Z","updated_at":"2023-01-10T03:21:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> 1.
