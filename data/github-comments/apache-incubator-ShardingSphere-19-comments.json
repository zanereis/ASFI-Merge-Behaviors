some research with groovy related codes, only 2 classes uses groovy: InlineExpressionParser and InlineShardingStrategy.

to reply a litte bit late. Before I give my unit test code, I want to introduce our sharding algrothmn.\r\nwe have a table, named business_info, so we create java bean, mapper(dao). \r\nAnd we based on businessNo to get sharding table name. for example, businessNo is 330108002-0017-0118, so sharding table is business_info_330108002, it is simple. But becasue we may have some like query opreation. so we use Hint router to do like operation. Regarding it, we use special flag to distinct which we should give all table, which we give related table.\r\n```\r\ncase1: use alltable mean get all sharding tables.\r\nHintManager hintManager2 = HintManager.getInstance();\r\nhintManager2.addDatabaseShardingValue(\"business_info\", \"businessNo\", \"database\");\r\nhintManager2.addTableShardingValue(\"business_info\", \"businessNo\", \"alltable\");\r\n\r\ncase2: use alltable:level1 mean we get related sharding tables\r\nHintManager hintManager2 = HintManager.getInstance();\r\nhintManager2.addDatabaseShardingValue(\"business_info\", \"businessNo\", \"database\");\r\nhintManager2.addTableShardingValue(\"business_info\", \"businessNo\", \"alltable:level1\");\r\n```\r\nmapper sql\r\n```\r\n    <select id=\"myPageListWithLike\" resultMap=\"BaseResultMap\">\r\n    select * from business_info\r\n    where\r\n     1 = 1\r\n     and

@zhangfeibiao So far, I haven't received your friend request yet, so i can not get detail about your issue. But, i tried to reappear your problem. \r\n\r\nThat is, there are two tables t1 and t2, without sharding rule but existed in the same default datasource, and i use the SQL of select * from t1 left join t2 on t1.order_id = t2.order_id to do query. The result is the expected one.\r\n\r\nThe difference between yours and mine is the vesion of Sharding-JDBC. Also i read the related code of the Version 1.5.3, if my case is same with yours, i think Sharding-JDBC of Ver.1.5.3 will cause this problem, but Ver 3.0.0.M1 will not.\r\n\r\nSo i suggest you to use Sharding-JDBC with latest version. Thanks a lot, if any problem, please let me know.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/404029521/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/404073123","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/pull/996#issuecomment-404073123","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/996","id":404073123,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNDA3MzEyMw==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-11T07:32:33Z","updated_at":"2018-07-11T10:14:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#
