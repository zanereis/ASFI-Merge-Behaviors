`PDF` (if document wasn't `PDF`)\r\n> 3. list of pages as `PNG`\r\n>    So to get Original we should list files and filter `PNG` and `PDF` :))\r\n> \r\n\r\nThe above method has obvious limitation: it will not work if original file was PDF\r\n\r\nso to fix download issue for PDF I would do the following:\r\n```\r\n\tpublic final File getOriginal() {\r\n\t\tFile f = getFile(null);\r\n\t\tif (f != null) {\r\n\t\t\tFile p = f.getParentFile();\r\n\t\t\tif (p != null && p.exists()) {\r\n\t\t\t\tFile original = null;\r\n\t\t\t\tFile[] ff = p.listFiles(new OriginalFilter());\r\n\t\t\t\tif (ff !=

it works now!\r\n\r\nYou can enable the recoridng and it will just start recoring, you can stop it and it will stop recording and only stop sharing if sharing was disabled.\r\n\r\nHowever if you start recording, and then enable sharing while recording, and then stop recording, it will continue to share screen.\r\n\r\nYou can also share screen and start/stop recording as many times as you want.\r\n\r\nThe issue with the ghost KStream was because the video-util close closed the stream on the first try. The logic on client side was closing the stream in a way so you couldn't restart. Stopping from Server side actually works better. \r\nI'm not quite sure what happens client side its a also a bit confusing, cause if you \"just record\" on server side you still have a screen-share. Even though you don't create an screen-share event. Its kind of like hidden on the server, until you send the share event. \r\nSo I think controlling the logic from the server logic seems to work better.\r\n\r\nI also did check with a 2nd browser to make sure all screen-share events come through.
