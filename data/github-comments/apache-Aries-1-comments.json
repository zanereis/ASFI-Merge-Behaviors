of the code looks good but there are two things:\n- We can not simply introduce lombok. This would require a discussion on the dev list. For example in my eclipse the project did not compile anymore. So if you want to introduce this then you need to get backing by the aries community first. \n  As for this case the improvements in lines of code is not that big I propose you rewrite to plain java. At the same time you can start a discuss on dev of course.\n- Your commits do not reference the issue.
