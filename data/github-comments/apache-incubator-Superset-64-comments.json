It's a matter of of deriving the `BaseTable`, `BaseColumn` and `BaseMetric` models, creating the related ModelViews, and implementing a handful of of methods (ok well a bit more than that...). The most complex one is the query method, where you get a time filter, an array of metrics and columns to group by, a set of filters, whether the query is a time series of now, and somehow have to return a pandas dataframe.\r\n\r\nA solid Python programmer familiar with Flask/Django should be able to implement this a matter of days, perhaps a week or two.
