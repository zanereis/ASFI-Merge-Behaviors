In order to perform type coercion, the target type needs to be known which does not seem to be the available there. Without this information, we also cannot check for overflows.\r\n\r\nNote that type conversions are already happening in `RexToLixTranslator` as part of the `EnumUtils.convert()` call. The main contribution of my PR is to correctly convert numeric types to the expected target type. Currently, these conversions are failing due to a Java limitation that prevents numeric object types (`java.lang.Long` etc.) from being [directly cast](https://mkyong.com/java/java-lang-classcastexception-class-java-lang-integer-cannot-be-cast-to-class-java-lang-long/) to another numeric type. This is solved by first deriving a primitive `long` (not `Long`) value that can then be safely cast to the target type. This indirection does require an additional check because the object on which `longValue()` gets called may be null. I have not been able to find a simpler workaround for this Java limitation.\r\n\r\nThe remaining changes are unrelated to the reported issue and fix tests that were requested during the PR review, notably passing values to `numeric(N)` placeholders, and preventing overflows that could arise in the conversion process above. I also expect that `convertChecked()` will be replaced by Mihai's implementation after https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/3589 has been merged which will increase the type coverage.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/1985814301/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/1986000029","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/3711#issuecomment-1986000029","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/3711","id":1986000029,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAUNjNM52X_Sd","user":{"login":"caicancai","id":77189278,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MTg5Mjc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77189278?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caicancai","html_url":"https://github.com/caicancai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caicancai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caicancai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caicancai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caicancai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caicancai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caicancai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caicancai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caicancai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caicancai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-08T16:25:46Z","updated_at":"2024-03-08T16:25:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@tanclary It seems like I don't have a good way to solve this problem.

What problem?\r\n\r\nThank you for your reply. You can find that I defined ReturnTypes.DOUBLE_FORCE_NULLABLE in LOG10_MS. The purpose is to make LOG10_MS return null when log10(0). However, during my debugging process, I found that the ReturnTypes.DOUBLE_FORCE_NULLABLE I defined did not take effect.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@LibraryOperator(libraries = {MYSQL, SPARK})\r\n  public static final SqlFunction LOG10_MS =\r\n      ((SqlBasicFunction) LOG10).withKind(SqlKind.LOG10_MS)\r\n          .withReturnTypeInference(ReturnTypes.DOUBLE_FORCE_NULLABLE);\r\n```\r\n\r\nRegarding the ReturnType processing of LOG10_MS, it still follows the ReturnType logic of LOG10 in `SqlStdOperatorTable`\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic static final SqlFunction LOG10 =\r\n      SqlBasicFunction.create(\"LOG10\",\r\n          ReturnTypes.DOUBLE_NULLABLE,\r\n          OperandTypes.NUMERIC,\r\n          SqlFunctionCategory.NUMERIC);\r\n```\r\n\r\nCan you understand what I mean?\r\n\r\nI feel that the ReturnTypes.DOUBLE_FORCE_NULLABLE of LOG10_MS I defined must be overwritten.
