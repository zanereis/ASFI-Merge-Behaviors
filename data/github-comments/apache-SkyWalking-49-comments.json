However, the skywalking agent is [configured a bit too naively](https://github.com/apache/incubator-skywalking/blob/5e8410834de20254c2bdab2d86cdbfd79d600904/apm-sniffer/apm-agent/src/main/java/org/apache/skywalking/apm/agent/SkyWalkingAgent.java#L67) and will unlikely tackle huge loads. By using the default `BinaryLocator`, Byte Buddy needs to read class files from disc upon any class loading when the transformer is invoked. This will generate a huge load of I/O activity and therefore the observed traffic.\r\n\r\nI have several suggestions on how this can be improved:\r\n1. It is important to filter by \"cheap\" categories first, if possible. If you can exclude a namespace, Byte Buddy can discard a class for transformation without parsing the class. If you require complex properties, Byte Buddy might however need to parse multiple class files if this is necessary to process a matcher.\r\n2. It is also recommended to exclude classes that are known to be irrelevant to an agent, e.g. classes for reflection or on certain class loaders.\r\n3. It is important for performance and for reducing memory consumption, to cache type descriptions by defining a custom type strategy that applies some caching. This way I/O processing can be reduced by a large margin. Note that caching offers an actual opportunity for a memory leak, there needs to be some form of eviction.\r\n\r\nThe \"leak\" that is observed is rather slow GC due to jar file streams being expensive to collect. As they use finallizers, they need two collections and stay around for much longer as they should.\r\n\r\nThere are other possibilities to improve the use of Byte Buddy. There is not currently a good manual on this but I am planning to prepare a talk on this topic, also for explaining more on how to use Advice.\r\n\r\nFor a good configuration of Byte Buddy that is also open source, have a look at [Stage Monitor](https://github.com/stagemonitor/stagemonitor/blob/6804a0fe506c3f7fd210f8c05332d9648fbf3fce/stagemonitor-core/src/main/java/org/stagemonitor/core/instrument/AgentAttacher.java#L230) which has tackled most challanges.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/422414252/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/422428804","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/1666#issuecomment-422428804","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/1666","id":422428804,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMjQyODgwNA==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-18T14:59:13Z","updated_at":"2018-09-18T14:59:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@raphw Thanks for the analysis.\r\n\r\nFor exclusion namespaces, I definitely could choose some.

It is really mostly about avoiding IO as it generates a bunch of garbage, especially on older VMs. The ignore matcher you refer to is exluding any type that is loaded by a class loader that fulfills a certain condition. Excluding by class loader is done before even looking at the type, therefore such exclusing is very effective. If a class loader is known to not generate any types of interest, this is a good exclusion. It will not alter the result but lead to higher performance. Especially Groovy is problematic here as it needs to generate a lot of boring filler byte code to implement its dynamic features.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/422744067/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/422775551","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/1666#issuecomment-422775551","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/1666","id":422775551,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMjc3NTU1MQ==","user":{"login":"hepyu","id":3917749,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MTc3NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3917749?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hepyu","html_url":"https://github.com/hepyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hepyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hepyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hepyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hepyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hepyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hepyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hepyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hepyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hepyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-19T12:01:08Z","updated_at":"2018-09-19T12:01:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"the result with skywalking-agent-6.0.0-alpha-adjust-agent-setting.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3917749/45751144-09063580-bc44-11e8-8dbe-1d89b963a5a6.png)\r\n\r\njdk version is:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3917749/45751352-b37e5880-bc44-11e8-9ea7-185551c0d23e.png)\r\n\r\nIt seems the method to validate is not correct.
