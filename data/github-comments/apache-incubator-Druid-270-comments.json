How did you find all these leaks?\r\n\r\n@leventov Thanks for your comments. The way to discover all resource leaks is the LGTM.\r\n\r\nBefore https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/pull/8331\r\n\r\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8108788/63262462-9caf0e80-c2b8-11e9-9310-bde4f0f02749.png)\r\n\r\nAfter https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/pull/8331\r\n\r\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8108788/63313034-b8a4c580-c335-11e9-9d47-14bf105519ff.png)\r\n\r\nCome on, let's get to A+ as soon as possible. I think it's time to add the LGTM shield to the README document. :muscle:","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/522828591/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/522830436","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/8343#issuecomment-522830436","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8343","id":522830436,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMjgzMDQzNg==","user":{"login":"vogievetsky","id":177816,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzgxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177816?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky","html_url":"https://github.com/vogievetsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-20T02:48:13Z","updated_at":"2019-08-20T02:48:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM! 👍 \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/522830436/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/522841947","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/7818#issuecomment-522841947","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7818","id":522841947,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMjg0MTk0Nw==","user":{"login":"abhishekrb19","id":8687261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2ODcyNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8687261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekrb19","html_url":"https://github.com/abhishekrb19","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekrb19/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekrb19/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekrb19/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekrb19/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekrb19/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekrb19/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekrb19/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekrb19/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekrb19/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-20T03:52:07Z","updated_at":"2019-08-20T03:53:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@adziri @erindru I had the same issue.
