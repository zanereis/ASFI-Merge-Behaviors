I had raised a PR a year back :D regarding a similar thing i.e. grouping related items for GCP Storage under 1 module then to have multiple files here and there.\r\n\r\nRegarding `contrib` - I had different plans - as hooks/Ops for AWS, GCP evolve more rapidly than the core and we didn't have frequent airflow releases - I thought it would be better to have them in seprate repos similar to Terraform Providers but that needs a bigger work and a solid plan. But looks like we are having more frequent releases now + once we are TLP we can actually make the process faster.

Adding a new state was discussed but decided against.
