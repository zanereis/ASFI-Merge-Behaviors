The edge case of suppressing the Content-Type header for an empty message-body makes sense to fix and address. NIFI-1620 is dealing with this edge case.\n\nHowever, this PR is adding the ability to specify an HTTP request message-body directly as a property of InvokeHTTP.  In my opinion, this is not a desired feature, and I am -1 on this.  A static message-body can always be provided in a dataflow using a tool like ReplaceText; keeping the semantics that InvokeHTTP always reads from flowfile payloads has a good consistency.\n\nRecommend that this PR focus solely on the problem dealing with Content-Type of an empty payload for a POST/PUT operation.

Personally, I tried the processor by requesting basic SNMP data (such as uptime for example) on a CentOS machine with net-snmp agent running with various configurations in SNMP v1, v2c and v3 (MD5/DES). \n\nAs a side note, at this moment, the processor is expecting an OID in numerical format. If I try the following command on my computer:\n\n`snmpwalk -v2c -c public demo.snmplabs.com IF-MIB::interfaces`\n\nI can get numerical OID by adding the option -On:\n\n`snmpwalk -v2c -c public demo.snmplabs.com IF-MIB::interfaces -On`\n\nThis way I can see that IF-MIB::interfaces is equivalent to .1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1\n\nI will try to write something to help setting an environment. On a Linux-like environment, a quick setup can be:\nyum install net-snmp net-snmp-utils\nservice snmpd start\n\nIt will allow access to basic SNMP information in v1 and v2c with 'public' as community. For SNMP v3 setup, it is possible to add users using the command net-snmp-create-v3-user.\n\nHope it helps, if not, let me know ;)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/200748951/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/200797003","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/257#issuecomment-200797003","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/257","id":200797003,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwMDc5NzAwMw==","user":{"login":"olegz","id":172397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjM5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/172397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz","html_url":"https://github.com/olegz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-24T11:29:31Z","updated_at":"2016-03-24T11:29:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@michalklempa @pvillard31 thank you both for the input.

AMQP support is one of the most recent additions to NiFi and it's great to see its adoption is on the way. What's even more admirable is to see the \nmembers (such as yourself) of the community are eager to help making it even better by addressing some of the limitations these new components may have.\n\nThat said, keep in mind that certain limitations (especially in new components) may be there intentionally (as in this case). In other words this initial version of AMQP was not supporting _non-String-value-type_ properties since we wanted to give more thoughts as to the conversion strategies of such values to/from String given that NiFi attributes only support String as a value type. I'll comment more on this inline at the relevant parts of the code, but wanted to make sure that it is clear that such behavior was intentional and not a bug. I'll update JIRA classification accordingly as well. \n\nAlso, instead of saying \"1/4\" consider listing _timestamp, deliveryMode, headers, priority_ individually. The main point here is that one only cares about properties he/she needs and if the other 3/4 satisfy those needs then all is good while it may not be all good for others who need one of the unsupported properties. So the emphasis here should be on specific property rather then 1/4. \n\nLast but not least, consider the tone and basic ethics next time you interact in a public forum (JIRA/Github etc.). When writing things like \"the author of the code mustn't have. . .\" keep in mind that \nyou can not possibly know _what_, _where_ and _how_ in relation to the \"author's\" _intent_, _thoughts_ and/or _motivation_ unless you had direct interaction with him/her which I'll assume you didn't. Without such interaction these words become pure speculation which personalizes the issue and therefore counter productive. See more here: http://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct.html\n\nThat said, please see the comments in line as I go through the review.\n\nOnce again thank you for you contribution!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/202095259/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/202099268","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/305#issuecomment-202099268","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/305","id":202099268,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwMjA5OTI2OA==","user":{"login":"steveyh25","id":15419234,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDE5MjM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15419234?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveyh25","html_url":"https://github.com/steveyh25","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveyh25/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveyh25/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveyh25/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveyh25/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveyh25/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveyh25/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveyh25/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveyh25/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveyh25/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-27T16:39:00Z","updated_at":"2016-03-27T16:39:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @olegz,\n\nThanks for your feedback.

very cool that you're tackling this! Thanks for jumping in! The only concern that I have with this patch is that if we end up with a buggy processor that starts generating TONS of bulletins, or if we have something like LogAttribute running and continually generating bulletins, creating the LinkedHashMap continually is fairly expensive. What do you think about using a CircularLifoQueue, which is in the Commons Collections package? I'll attach a patch to the JIRA so you can see exactly what i'm thinking. I think it'll simplify the logic a good bit, and the unit tests that you put together will be perfect to test it!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/202419168/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/202630454","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/305#issuecomment-202630454","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/305","id":202630454,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwMjYzMDQ1NA==","user":{"login":"steveyh25","id":15419234,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDE5MjM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15419234?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveyh25","html_url":"https://github.com/steveyh25","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveyh25/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveyh25/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveyh25/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveyh25/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveyh25/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveyh25/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveyh25/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveyh25/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveyh25/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-28T23:48:04Z","updated_at":"2016-03-28T23:48:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@olegz,\n\nPlease see latest commit. The try-catch block has been removed and I've changed the validation slightly like was spoken about. It appears as though we don't need to worry about NPE, because if no value is provided for the flow attribute then it appears to be ignored anyway (i.e it is not a part of flowFile.getAttributes()).\n\nI couldn't find any great way of dealing with the parsing of values other than catching the NumberFormatException - things like StringUtils.isNumeric() are nice but we can still be in a situation where a number is deemed to be numeric but parseInt will throw an exception anyway because the number's too big to store -
