For supporting interrupts we'll have to add interrupt checks everywhere so it is not limited to `SegmentPruner`.\r\n\r\nI haven't checked Guava `TimeLimiter` either but I don't think it would be able to stop an arbitrary function unless the function itself supports interruption (by checking Thread interrupt status). For context even Future methods like `Future.cancel` only set the interrupt flag and don't actually \"cancel\" any arbitrary function.\r\n\r\nThe thing that is interesting though is why the segment pruner is taking this long. Can you share more context about the issue: how many segments you have, what's the query you are trying, etc.\r\n\r\nI presume it is the `ColumnValueSegmentPruner` which is taking a long time.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1496415897/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1496428631","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/10539#issuecomment-1496428631","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/10539","id":1496428631,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5ZMbBX","user":{"login":"priyen","id":10234864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjM0ODY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10234864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/priyen","html_url":"https://github.com/priyen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priyen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priyen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priyen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priyen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priyen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priyen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priyen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priyen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priyen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-04T18:37:49Z","updated_at":"2023-04-04T18:37:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ankitsultana , I work with johan so I can also chime in here, this is on a instance using hard-drive's as the backing store, and one instance can also have thousands of segments.

Say these blocks were sent in order: `B1, B2, B3, EOS`.\r\n\r\nEither via callback or during first run of the OpChain, we will consume `B1` and add it to the priority queue. However, even though we consumed something, we return a NoOp block to the top.\r\n\r\nSince we receive a NoOp block, we will try to yield, in where we'll check whether there's any callback for this OpChain (by looking up `_seenMail`).\r\n\r\nSay there is a callback, in that case we will schedule the OpChain again and clear the `_seenMail` entry. In the second run we'll consume `B2` and try to yield again. This time there's no callback entry so stay yielded and wait for automatic promotion to happen.\r\n\r\nA possible fix for this would be to add a new MailboxReceiveOperator, say `SortedMailboxReceiveOperator` which does something similar to `buildBroadcastHashTable` in the join operator, i.e. continuously poll mailboxes until you get null or EOS. We could also create a `SortOperator > MailboxReceiveOperator` combo when we need to sort on receiver side so we don't have to re-implement Mailbox receive logic.\r\n\r\nThere's a separate issue of missed callbacks btw which I have been punting for a while. I'll invest more time on this ticket next week: https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/10424\r\n\r\nLmk if I missed something.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1498530597/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1498583777","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/10564#issuecomment-1498583777","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/10564","id":1498583777,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5ZUpLh","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-06T06:58:20Z","updated_at":"2023-04-19T19:28:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/10564?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) Report\n> Merging [#10564](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/10564?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (24c190e) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/commit/e3d74339a41c7fbeffe7904adf4fd9ea27398ad3?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (e3d7433) will **decrease** coverage by `5.93%`.\n> The diff coverage is `50.00%`.\n\n```diff\n@@             Coverage Diff              @@\n##             master   #10564      +/-   ##\n============================================\n- Coverage     70.29%   64.36%   -5.93%     \n- Complexity     6462     6473      +11     \n============================================\n  Files          2103     2052      -51     \n  Lines        112767   110960    -1807     \n  Branches      16979    16800     -179     \n============================================\n- Hits          79265    71420    -7845     \n- Misses        27947    34372    +6425     \n+ Partials       5555     5168     -387     \n```\n\n| Flag | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| integration1 | `?` | |\n| integration2 | `?` | |\n| unittests1 | `67.88% <50.00%> (+0.04%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| unittests2 | `13.92% <0.00%> (+0.05%)` | :arrow_up: |\n\nFlags with carried forward coverage won't be shown.

I’ll take up this fix today. I don’t want to add a SortOperator on top as in the future we want to things like sort on sender and have receiver do k way merge and things like partitioned sort for window functions where we only sort within a partition instead of a full sort. Sort operator also applies an upper limit for limit which needs to be handled very carefully for window functions to avoid correctness issues. Also the sort exchange means that any receiving operators above it can expect sorted data.

For example, it may be useful to publish fine-grained CPU time/memory metrics for the various phases of ingestion: \r\n1. when the consumer fetches a batch of messages (call to `partitionGroupConsumer.fetchMessages`), \r\n2. the messages are decoded (call to `streamDataDecoder.decode`), \r\n3. the rows are processed by the transform pipeline (call to `transformPipeline.processRow`) and \r\n4. the rows are indexed (call to `realtimeSegment.index`).\r\n\r\nIn addition, it would also be useful to have an end-to-end metric that combines all of the above.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1500397690/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1500452829","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/10575#issuecomment-1500452829","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/10575","id":1500452829,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5Zbxfd","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-07T16:45:29Z","updated_at":"2023-04-21T00:06:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/10575?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) Report\n> Merging [#10575](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/10575?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (ea7fba7) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/commit/7adac6f60eb6bafc98eb0f61f4860fadf40f4f03?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (7adac6f) will **decrease** coverage by `0.17%`.\n> The diff coverage is `29.77%`.\n\n```diff\n@@             Coverage Diff              @@\n##             master   #10575      +/-   ##\n============================================\n- Coverage     70.35%   70.19%   -0.17%     \n+ Complexity     6499     6496       -3     \n============================================\n  Files          2107     2108       +1     \n  Lines        113460   113759     +299     \n  Branches      17101    17184      +83     \n============================================\n+ Hits          79822    79849      +27     \n- Misses        28038    28305     +267     \n- Partials       5600     5605       +5     \n```\n\n| Flag | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| integration1 | `24.28% <0.00%> (-0.12%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| integration2 | `23.77% <0.00%> (-0.18%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| unittests1 | `67.77% <29.77%> (-0.14%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| unittests2 | `13.84% <0.00%> (-0.04%)` | :arrow_down: |\n\nFlags with carried forward coverage won't be shown.
