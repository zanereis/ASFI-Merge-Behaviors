For eg. we can have avro keys with special ttl field. Or string key which end with _ttlxxxx. This does look ugly but this way we avoid having to maintain a separate state to keep track of which records are expired, which IMO is a huge gain

The difference between `FATAL_ERROR` and `ABORTABLE_ERROR` is that the former state will throw an exception back at the user even if they try to call `abortTransaction()`. The only possible recovery is closing the producer (see related issue https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-5342). In some cases, we may reach an abortable error before any partition has been successfully added to the transaction (this is unfortunately the consequence of not having a BeginTxn request). We want the user to call `abortTransaction()` in this case, but we want to avoid sending EndTxn since this would cause an invalid transaction state.\r\n\r\nI've been thinking about the current patch for a while and finally it LGTM. The subtle thing is the fact that we'll keep retrying AddPartition failures as long as we get retriable errors. If we receive an abortable error, we'll stop retrying and the EndTxn should reach the head of the queue. Luckily we made the AddPartitions request have all or nothing semantics, so any failure would mean we haven't started the transaction (assuming there were no previous successes).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/304532837/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/304537984","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/3160#issuecomment-304537984","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/3160","id":304537984,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNDUzNzk4NA==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-28T20:24:56Z","updated_at":"2017-05-28T20:24:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nRefer

Sorry for late review. It does seem that this adds quite a bit complexity and will be a bit hard to reason about. So, I agree that the easiest thing is to just revert the changes in KAFKA-4340 and default message.timestamp.difference.max.ms back to Long.MaxValue. Without KAFKA-4340, in the worse case, it seems that every other segment could be rolled with just a single message in it. It's not ideal, but probably won't break things immediately. The users can always explicitly override the config if desired. Do you think you could submit a patch to default message.timestamp.difference.max.ms back to Long.MaxValue in the next few days for the 0.11.0.0

`TestUtils.waitUntilMetadataIsPropagated`, and try running the unit test with / wo your patch on a \"slow environment\" e.g. 1 CPU, small memory, to demonstrate that \"wo the patch the test fails X
