one suggestion would be to have the cell x-axis represent the [min(0, min-value), max(0, max-value)] range, so if you have values of (-10, -5, 10, 40, 20) it would produce the following bars:\r\n```\r\n|xx        |      \r\n| x        |\r\n|  xx      |\r\n|  xxxxxxxx|\r\n|  xxxx    |\r\n```\r\ni.e., both negative and positive values could be shown simultaneously and you wouldn't need to include the check box or change the color for visualizing negative values.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/371339003/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/371348399","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/4561#issuecomment-371348399","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/4561","id":371348399,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MTM0ODM5OQ==","user":{"login":"laoliang330","id":17824500,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODI0NTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17824500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/laoliang330","html_url":"https://github.com/laoliang330","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laoliang330/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laoliang330/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laoliang330/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laoliang330/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laoliang330/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laoliang330/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laoliang330/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laoliang330/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laoliang330/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-08T01:40:14Z","updated_at":"2018-03-08T01:40:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"thank

By default these are on, meaning it will right align the bar charts and coloring negative numbers (to be backwards compatible with current viz style). By turning `Right Align` off you will get bars going left for negative and right for positive.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"418\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-03-08 at 8 52 19 am\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/729913/37164007-0b14540e-22ae-11e8-8961-0a79ae9c9fb5.png\">\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/371549279/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/371566577","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/4577#issuecomment-371566577","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/4577","id":371566577,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MTU2NjU3Nw==","user":{"login":"darylerwin","id":25016569,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MDE2NTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25016569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/darylerwin","html_url":"https://github.com/darylerwin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darylerwin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darylerwin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darylerwin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darylerwin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darylerwin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darylerwin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darylerwin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darylerwin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darylerwin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-08T17:47:50Z","updated_at":"2018-03-08T17:47:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"reran and refresh and it shows correctly.

Now we know that they're not going to read those 1M rows like it's a book, and 1K usually is a decent sample. Now what are some legit things they might do that requires 1M rows?\r\n* exporting the CSV to excel (different button)\r\n* searching client-side using the instant filtering table search functionality, which isn't a super-legit use-case since they could use a `LIKE` statement or something equivalent, though `LIKE` assumes you know the column. Anyhow. Returning 1M rows to full-text search a table isn't great.\r\n* infinite scrolling looking for patterns?\r\n* sort a column and use pagination?\r\n\r\nIn any case, it may be a good thing to always do 1K and allow them to push a button to get the whole set (and wait longer, maybe crash their browser). Perhaps the data table shows a msg at the top `showing first 1k rows, click here to load the entire data set`.\r\n\r\nI haven't looked at the implementation of `fetchmany` for Presto/Hive in pyhive, but in theory given the `dbapi` spec you should be able to `fetchmany(1000)` and then fetchmany(MAX_ROWS). Assuming all this is happening on the worker (async), you'd ship the 1k to a first results backend location, and the whole set to another later on. That implies the introduction of:\r\n* a new query state `partially_saved`\r\n* perhaps some `db_engine_spec` methods if the `two_phase_save` need some specific handling on different engines\r\n* frontend logic that understands `partially_saved`, and exposes that to the user, allowing them to fetch the whole data set. CSV export should probably be greyed until the second phase is saved\r\n* configuration elements to turn this on and off (per db? per db engine as a BaseEngineSpec class attr?)\r\n* introduce 2 environment configuration settings `PARTIAL_SAVE_ROW_COUNT`, `MAX_SAVE_ROW_COUNT` or something equivalent?\r\n\r\nOh and I wanted to make it clear that we absolutely should not run the query twice, that's just not right.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/372197841/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/372336673","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/4193#issuecomment-372336673","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/4193","id":372336673,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MjMzNjY3Mw==","user":{"login":"brylie","id":17307,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17307?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brylie","html_url":"https://github.com/brylie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brylie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brylie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brylie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brylie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brylie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brylie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brylie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brylie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brylie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-12T14:51:04Z","updated_at":"2018-03-12T14:51:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@xiaohanyu, any status update here?\r\n\r\nPerhaps we can compromise and put these files in a `docker` folder, so it is explicit what they are for?\r\n\r\nHaving a Docker container would really make this project more viable for several reasons, notably development and deployment.
