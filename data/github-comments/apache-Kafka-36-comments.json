overall general comment on the implementation is that the brokers properties themselves could cary this information making it so the topic creator doesn't have to know this. the fact is that still a lot of humans run the topic command but in many cases it is some software system operationally doing it. in either case if the broker had a property rack=0 or whatever it could then just be the way you have the topic distribute that information it should already be able to gather. Granted, this implementation saves a lot of having to store it in zookeeper so rationally speaking this is better than putting any code in to that. \n\nSorry if I missed the entire discussion thread on this just seeing it for first time.

Personally I feel this additional logic in \"selectLeader\" does make sense, since in general we may not be able to trigger the last \"remove replica\" event when the failed replica is the controller itself, and hence from the view of the new controller the old replica leader was never failed but just no longer in the aliveBroker list any more.\n\nSo before we abort the leader election process due to either error or configured mechanism (e.g. unclean leader election not allowed), we may need to update the corresponding \"source-of-truth\" to reflect the abortion, that the new leader was not successfully elected, and hence the partition should be \"offline\".\n\nAn alternative way to do this, is when new controller is elected (in `ControllerFailover`), let it to browse through the ZK's stored leaderAndISRs and check if any of the brokers are no longer in the aliveBroker list, and if any trigger `onBrokerFailured` on each one of them. This may also be as efficient since we are already reading all the topics' replica assignment anyways in `ControllerFailover`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/171370153/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/171372918","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/765#issuecomment-171372918","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/765","id":171372918,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MTM3MjkxOA==","user":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-13T17:31:36Z","updated_at":"2016-01-13T17:31:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Addressed your comment @guozhangwang and thanks for the review.

I'm just getting started with this code, but the current threading model seems reasonable to me. I see the Worker as just the task manager, which is primarily responsible for managing the task lifecycle. Currently this just means starting and stopping tasks, but it'll probably have to be extended to handle task failures. I assume it'll also need hooks for status tracking. Also, I like the tasks being single-threaded since it makes it easy to reason about their state.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/171426445/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/171441572","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/768#issuecomment-171441572","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/768","id":171441572,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MTQ0MTU3Mg==","user":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-13T21:33:56Z","updated_at":"2016-01-13T21:33:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"LGTM\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/171441572/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/171441606","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/768#issuecomment-171441606","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/768","id":171441606,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MTQ0MTYwNg==","user":{"login":"granthenke","id":1928566,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Mjg1NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1928566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke","html_url":"https://github.com/granthenke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-13T21:34:03Z","updated_at":"2016-01-13T21:34:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Looks like this shows up in configuration.html too. \nCould you put \"MINOR:\" at the start of the pull request title too?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/171441606/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/171442202","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/110#issuecomment-171442202","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/110","id":171442202,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MTQ0MjIwMg==","user":{"login":"granthenke","id":1928566,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Mjg1NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1928566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke","html_url":"https://github.com/granthenke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-13T21:36:35Z","updated_at":"2016-01-13T21:36:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@dajac Just a minor update for the exceptionName method.
