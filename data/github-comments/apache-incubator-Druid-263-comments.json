don't believe there is a single best way to handle wrong configuration. I propose the severity of the reaction be related to the detectability and impact of the failure mode.\r\n\r\nAs a simple example, if I have a config option I know is coming in 0.16.0, and I put it in a config file for 0.15.0 knowing it will be ignored in that version, I expect the system to politely ignore the config. Likewise if a config option is deprecated in 0.15.0, and will be gone in 0.16.0, then the system should warn of the use of a deprecated option during the 0.15.0 transition release.\r\n\r\nPart of the reason I am against outright failure on *all* configuration problems is that there are many ways configurations can be odd and not actually a problem, and possibly even intended.\r\n\r\nI propose having an outright error only in cases where the system effectively says \"You have not told me what to do and I have no reasonable default, or you have told me too many things to do and I can't reconcile them.\"\r\n\r\nExamples of the first case are things like passing in arrays when single values are required (parsing). Examples of the second are when multiple things are defined for a singleton.

The benchmark code is available in [my branch](https://github.com/jihoonson/druid/blob/minor-compaction-benchmark/benchmarks/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/timeline/VersionedIntervalTimelineBenchmark.java) and will raise another pr for it after this PR is merged. Please note that this benchmark doesn't compare the performance of `VersionedIntervalTimeline` of this PR with that of the master branch. The primary purpose of this benchmark is to measure how slow `VersionedIntervalTimeline` is with segmentLock after this PR. (When timeChunk lock is used, `VersionedIntervalTimeline` performs a bit more operations such as creating an `OvershadowableManager` of a single partitionChunk than that of master. However, the overall performance wouldn't be much different.)\r\n\r\nTL;DR `VersionedIntervalTimeline` is slower with segment lock than that with timeChunk lock, but it's still acceptable. \r\n\r\n### Data setup\r\n\r\nA synthetic segments were created to emulate the usual compaction scenario where initial segments are created and then they got compacted while new segments are appended. The benchmark first generates `numInitialRootGenSegmentsPerInterval` segments per interval. Then, it generates `numInitialRootGenSegmentsPerInterval * COMPACTED_SEGMENTS_RATIO_TO_INITIAL_SEGMENTS` compacted segments which overwrites the segments of the previous generation. It also generates new appending segments. This can be repeated more than once based on `numNonRootGenerations`.\r\n\r\nHere, I pasted only some of results, e.g., when segmentGranularity = MONTH or # of non-root generations = 5, because they look similar. In every graph, blue and red represent throughput when using timeChunk lock and segment lock, respectively. Line charts show the throughput with varying # of total segments (including overshadowed ones). The _log scale_ is used for y axis of all line charts. The bar charts just show the one data point in line charts where # of segments = 160 which is the number Druid dataSources usually have per timeChunk.\r\n\r\n#### Lookup\r\n\r\n![Lookup - varying # of segments](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2322288/61318527-28191980-a7ba-11e9-9a44-1028779af121.png)\r\n![Lookup - 160 segments](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2322288/61318529-294a4680-a7ba-11e9-8998-339754399671.png)\r\n\r\nTo measure the throughput of the `lookup` method, the benchmark picks up a random interval which spans 3 time chunks based on segmentGranularity. This result says the timeline is pretty faster with timeChunk lock than using segment lock. But 23620.913 ops/s is still fast. Regarding peak CPU usage, there's no big difference between using timeChunk lock and segment lock.\r\n\r\n#### FindFullyOvershadowed\r\n\r\n![findFullyOvershadowed - varying # of segments](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2322288/61318539-2d766400-a7ba-11e9-8db2-656d00ec4fe3.png)\r\n![findFullyOvershadowed - 160 segments](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2322288/61318543-2ea79100-a7ba-11e9-858a-58645de94d33.png)\r\n\r\n`findFullyOvershadowed` is very slow with segmentLock. This is because the implementation is not very optimized, especially the constructor of `PartitionHolder`. Here is the code snippet.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  public PartitionHolder(List<PartitionChunk<T>> initialChunks)\r\n  {\r\n    this.overshadowableManager = new OvershadowableManager<>();\r\n    for (PartitionChunk<T> chunk : initialChunks) {\r\n      add(chunk);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis could be improved by adding a bulk construction of OvershadowableManager, but `findFullyOvershadowed` is called only one place in production code, i.e., `ParallelSubIndexTask`. I think it could be done later rather than in this PR.\r\n\r\n#### IsOvershadowed\r\n\r\n![isOvershadowed - varying # of segments](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2322288/61318549-31a28180-a7ba-11e9-98fc-f6b7da33fcaa.png)\r\n![isOvershadowed - 160 segments](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2322288/61318552-32d3ae80-a7ba-11e9-88da-1efeee4bd879.png)\r\n\r\n`isOvershadowed` shows a pretty similar throughput. The benchmark chooses a random one among timeChunks populated based on segmentGranularity. As a result, the benchmark always executes the below part in `isOvershadowed` method.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n      TimelineEntry entry = completePartitionsTimeline.get(interval);\r\n      if (entry != null) {\r\n        final int majorVersionCompare = versionComparator.compare(version, entry.getVersion());\r\n        if (majorVersionCompare == 0) {\r\n          for (PartitionChunk<ObjectType> chunk : entry.partitionHolder) {\r\n            if (chunk.getObject().isOvershadow(object)) {\r\n              return true;\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n          return false;\r\n        } else {\r\n          return majorVersionCompare < 0;\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince the number of visible segments to be iterated in the for loop is same with timeChunk and segment locks, their throughput should be similar.\r\n\r\n#### Add\r\n\r\n![add - varying # of segments](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2322288/61318564-37986280-a7ba-11e9-9f32-655580ab3245.png)\r\n![add - 160 segments](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2322288/61318568-38c98f80-a7ba-11e9-85bb-e4eac6b3082b.png)\r\n\r\nFor `add`, it's faster with segment lock because I think `TimelineEntry` should be created for each new segment of new major version. When using segment lock, new segment of new minor version can be added into the same `TimelineEntry`.\r\n\r\n#### Remove\r\n\r\n![remove - varying # of segments](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2322288/61318573-3a935300-a7ba-11e9-81ca-57b0968f13c0.png)\r\n![remove - 160 segments](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2322288/61318578-3bc48000-a7ba-11e9-907b-cd073af734da.png)\r\n\r\n`remove` is slower with segment lock. This is expected since whenever a visible segment is removed, `OvershadowableManager` needs to check all overshadowed atomicUpdateGroups to determine the visible one.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/511966275/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/512006804","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/8089#issuecomment-512006804","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8089","id":512006804,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMjAwNjgwNA==","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-16T22:08:45Z","updated_at":"2019-07-16T22:08:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM overall.

so travis builds don't become significantly faster.\r\n\r\nfor local work , typically I run  specific tests using IDE which run pretty fast or I use maven on specific modules, I am working on, using

and see if gradle offers a much better/faster way of doing same, that could help assess whether it makes sense to move to gradle.\r\n\r\nin time, maven might catch up on incremental builds too.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/512528628/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/512530237","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/8095#issuecomment-512530237","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8095","id":512530237,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMjUzMDIzNw==","user":{"login":"AlexanderSaydakov","id":13126686,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTI2Njg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13126686?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderSaydakov","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexanderSaydakov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderSaydakov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderSaydakov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderSaydakov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderSaydakov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderSaydakov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderSaydakov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderSaydakov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderSaydakov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderSaydakov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-17T19:13:20Z","updated_at":"2019-07-17T19:13:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This
