It is simply not advised to be used for large datasets. If you think about it, it needs to retrieve the data (which might be distributed over several nodes) to the local JVM and trigger the program execution.\n\nIf you found that the only way to implement `difference` is to overload `removeVertices`, then we should also consider what this means in terms of the API.

for your contribution @rbraeunlich et al. It looks very good. I had some minor comments which you find in the code. While going through the code and looking at scikit-learn I was wondering whether we shouldn't separate the IDF from the TF part and realize them as two `Transformer`.\n\nThe TF transformer could be something like scikit-learn's `CountVectorizer` or a the HashingTermFrequency transformer. The HashingTermFrequency transformer could look like the code you've written for calculating the `dictionary`. This tranformer will take care of generating the numeric vector representing the term frequency.\n\nThe IDF transformer is then trained on the numeric vectors generated from the corpus. The training means calculating the IDF values for the different terms. You can then predict new documents by first transforming the document using the TF transformer (giving a vector of term frequencies) and then apply the IDF weighting.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nWe also updated the pipelining mechanism. Thus, it would be great if you could rebase your PR on the latest master.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/112824195/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/112824285","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/730#issuecomment-112824285","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/730","id":112824285,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExMjgyNDI4NQ==","user":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-17T14:29:08Z","updated_at":"2015-06-17T14:29:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"No

For your code to be readable, it is nice to leave a space after the commas separating arguments. For example `myMethod(arg1, arg2, arg3)` instead of `myMethod(arg1,arg2,arg3)`.\n  We usually separate the closing of a parenthesis and the opening of a curly bracket with a space, i.e. `myMethod() { ... }` instead of  `myMethod(){ ... }`.\n  Also, try to avoid adding new lines if they are not needed.\n  Regarding the types missing, this is not creating an error, but gives a warning. You can turn on warning notification settings in your IDE to avoid this.\n- I like it that you added separate `includeFields` methods for vertices and edges. It would probably make sense to do the same for the rest of the methods. For example, you might want to skip the first line in the edges file, but not in the vertices file. Right now, you are forced to either do both or none. Alternatively, we could add parameters to the existing methods, to define the behavior for edges and vertices files separately. For example `public GraphCsvReader lineDelimiter(String vertexDelimiter, String edgeDelimiter)`. What do you think?\n- Finally, in order to catch issues like the one with the null `VertexReader`, you should always try to test as much functionality you have added as possible. In this case, it would be a good idea to add a test reading from edges only and some tests for the different methods you have added.\n\nLet me know if you have questions!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/112954221/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/112968975","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/802#issuecomment-112968975","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/802","id":112968975,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExMjk2ODk3NQ==","user":{"login":"gaborhermann","id":6912263,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MTIyNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6912263?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborhermann","html_url":"https://github.com/gaborhermann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborhermann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborhermann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborhermann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborhermann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborhermann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborhermann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborhermann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborhermann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborhermann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-17T22:23:17Z","updated_at":"2015-06-17T22:23:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I updated the PR.

like this very much, Kudos Gyula and Paris, this is good work. This text should definitely go into the Wiki, for reference.\n\nI have a few thoughts and ideas on how we may be able to push this even one step further. Let's figure out how many of those actually mean changes, and which ones can simply be added after this is merged.\n\n### Current State Interface\n\nI would like we keep the current interface in parallel to the new one. People seem to like it quite a bit (from the demos in the past days) and I think the additional code paths to maintain for that are not too many. The current interface also comes in handy for states that cannot be maintained per key, for example the probabilistic counters and aggregates that explicitly do not maintain an entry per key, but only bitmaps across all keys.\n\nI think it would be an okay initial restriction if they are non-re-partitionable.\n\n### State Backing / Checkpointing & Restoring\n\nThis design makes the assumption that the state is held in the Flink operators and is checkpointed to an outside storage, via the StateCheckpointer.\n\nHow about we generalize this a bit, to make it pluggable where the state is actually stored? From recent feedback, I heard that people find it useful to store the state actually in an external key/value store (habe, cassandra, ...) and have Flink' checkpointing algorithm coordinate the group commits.\n\nThis would mean:\n- Having the state in Flink is one implementation of the state store. The current state backend becomes something that is used when the state is held in Flink.\n- Having the state in a key/value store would mean that we group commit changes into that key/value store (upon shanpshots) and that we keep inside Flink only caches of recent keys (for faster read access). That way, we solve out-of-core state and this also subsumes the lazy state fetching, as an operator would start with an empty local cache and pull key state as needed. No special code required.\n- In the long run, we will probably want to have a lightweight key-value store that we start with the system in streaming mode.\n\n### API integration\n\nMy feeling here is that we should not have special constructs like \"setStatePartitioner()\", but introduce something like a \"KeyedDataStream\", and key-state operators work only on that type of data stream. GroupBy data streams are a special case (stronger) of the KeyedDataStream, so groupBy/window and mapWindow, or reduce, have always the ability to hold key state. For map/flatMap, one would need to write `stream.keyBy(\"userid\").map(...)`\n\n### Asynchronous state checkpoints\n\nThis interface is a good basis for asynchronous checkpoints, because we can do a copy-on-write per key if it is changed while the checkpoint writing is still in progress. Since we have multiple concurrent checkpoints (possibly), we need to design this carefully to allow us to have a sequence of deltas against also other deltas, not only against the full state.\n\nThis is only relevant when the state is in Flink. When the state is backed externally (key/value store), the checkpoint conceptually only group commits and starts a new bulk transaction, which does not involve any data movement.\n\n### Incremental state checkpoints\n\nAgain, this is only relevant when the state is in Flink. Here, this interface is also a good basis, since we can persist the state of the keys that changes. We cannot go incremental per key with that, which remains to be seen whether it would be relevant to do that. In the case of long windows, we certainly want incremental snapshots of the individual  window buffers, but it is unclear whether we need to expose such a thing to the user.\n\n### (Very vague so far) Shared replicated state (via CRDTs)\n\nI have been thinking a bit whether it would make sense to allow parallel instances to have shared state\nthat is updated asynchronously. This would not make sense for general state/data types, but where the types can be implemented by CRDTs (conflict-free replicated distributed datatypes), this may be very feasible and quite useful. Parallel operators could maintain shared replicated counters or histograms that way.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/113881056/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/113890106","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/747#issuecomment-113890106","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/747","id":113890106,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExMzg5MDEwNg==","user":{"login":"gyfora","id":5880972,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODA5NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5880972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora","html_url":"https://github.com/gyfora","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-21T12:00:59Z","updated_at":"2015-06-21T12:00:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the nice feedback Stephan it makes a lot of sense what you have written :+1: \n\nLet me quickly react to these points separately:\n\n### Current State Interface\n\nI am okay with keeping the current Checkpointed interfaces, but I wonder if they are equivalent with the simple non-partitioned state abstractions. \n\nAnyways, I want to do some refactor to make partitioned/non-partitioned states more transparent on the runtime and allow mixing them. This will probably mean that I will add a boolean flag to the getOperatorState(...) method to get either partitioned or non-partitioned state (partitioned would throw exception if it is not a keyed stream).\n\n### State Backing / Checkpointing & Restoring\n\nThis is a very good idea, I like it :) I think a slight refactor would allow us to specify any action to be taken during a snapshot, which would either return the handles and store it right now, or return null after doing the proper interaction with the external store. I  think it is safe to say that this could be an extension do be added later. \n\nI see some immediate issues with the group commit logic to the external store. I wonder when we would actually do the commit, because the fact that the operator takes a snapshot doesnt mean that the checkpoint will be completed so we might need to roll-back. This assumes that we can roll back on the external store as well, and that is a strong assumption. Another way would be to commit the changes with the checkpoint committer interface (like in the KafkaSource) but then if we fail before committing we end up with a corrupted snapshot (the system thinks its complete but in reality the external storage doesnt contain the changes so no way to restore).\n\n### API integration\n\nI agree completely. We need to allow mixing partitioned/nonpartitioned states as I said in the first point.\n\n### Asynchronous state checkpoints\n\nAgreed.\n\n### Incremental state checkpoints\n\nAgreed, and I even think maybe we can support per-key incremental snapshots if that is absolutely necessary (such as windowbuffers). This could be an interface which incrementally computes the delta after each update(...) call. This might be tricky though but should be possible.\n\n### Shared replicated state\n\nThis would be very cool indeed :)\n\nI will start doing some refactoring to make it possible to incorporate the suggested changes.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/113890106/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/113898364","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/747#issuecomment-113898364","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/747","id":113898364,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExMzg5ODM2NA==","user":{"login":"mbalassi","id":5990983,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5OTA5ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5990983?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi","html_url":"https://github.com/mbalassi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-21T13:07:19Z","updated_at":"2015-06-21T13:07:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the design outline guys, it looks great. Two minor comments in terms of implementation:\n- Let us make some more emphasis on the architecture of discarding or compaction old checkpoint data. This seems a minor issue, but we have seen during the recent release testing that it has implications. [1] In the current version the `JobManager` discards old state, so it needs access to it. If I understand it correctly that behavior is intact after this PR.\n- API: `KeyedDataStream` should be feasible if we really make it a more general version of data stream. The interplay with windowed and connected streams is interesting. The reason why e.g. a windowed and grouping fits nicely is that the windowed groups contain only elements from one group. You propose the same design for keyed streams as well? \n\n[1] https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-2221\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/113898364/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/113907348","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/684#issuecomment-113907348","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/684","id":113907348,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExMzkwNzM0OA==","user":{"login":"ggevay","id":11377925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzc3OTI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11377925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggevay","html_url":"https://github.com/ggevay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggevay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggevay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggevay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggevay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggevay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggevay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggevay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggevay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggevay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-21T14:19:57Z","updated_at":"2015-06-21T14:19:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I merged Marton's changes (moving to contrib) to this PR.\nI also added a paragraph to the streaming programming guide.

A lot of it looks good. \n\nThe one thing I would really like to change is the modification of the execution graph state machine. That one is delicate enough and any change to that is super critical and intensive to review and test.\n\nI think we can add this functionality without any change to that state machine, and should do that. Stopping a streaming program is much like letting it come to a finish (telling the source to not consume the stream any further).\n\nHow about simply sending the stopping message to the running sources (not to all vertices) and letting the execution states transition from RUNNING to FINISHED in the regular manner. This would also allow concurrent canceling, failure, everything would remain transparent.\n\nIn an initial version, I would also recommend to not have the extra JobStatus. Just to get the thing working and stable. Then we can later add the extra state, if desired (for logging, web frontend).\n\nSome other comments:\n- I think it would be nice to not overload the `AbstractInvokable` with more methods. Similar as in the case of checkpointing, you can have an interface (stoppable ;-) ) that the invokable can implement to receive the message.\n\nBTW: I still prefer \"stop\" over \"terminate\" ;-) Terminating the programs sounds very forceful (like dropping a bomb in the data center). Maybe I am just spoiled by some movies...\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/114109425/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
