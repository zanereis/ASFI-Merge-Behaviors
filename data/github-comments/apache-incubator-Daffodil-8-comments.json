It's actually caused by 2.12.12, though I'm not sure what changed from 2.12.11 to 2.12.12 to cause it to happen, but at least I know why it's failing, and some potential workarounds. Here's a really simple way to reproduce the failure:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n// Thing contains list of other Things\r\nclass Thing() extends Serializable {\r\n  var things: Seq[Thing] = _\r\n}\r\n\r\nobject Test {\r\n\r\n  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {\r\n    // Create two things\r\n    val a = new Thing()\r\n    val b = new Thing()\r\n \r\n    // Put thing B in a list\r\n    val l = Seq(b)\r\n\r\n    // Set that list to the things list in both A and B\r\n    a.things = l\r\n    b.things = l\r\n\r\n    // Serialize and Deserialize Thing A\r\n    val baos = new java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream()\r\n    val oos = new java.io.ObjectOutputStream(baos)\r\n    oos.writeObject(a)\r\n    oos.close()\r\n    baos.close()\r\n    val bytes = baos.toByteArray()\r\n    val bais = new java.io.ByteArrayInputStream(bytes)\r\n    val ois = new java.io.ObjectInputStream(bais)\r\n    val newThingA = ois.readObject().asInstanceOf[Thing]\r\n  }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo we have a list containing thing B, an both A and B have a reference to that list. And then we try to serialize and deserialize A.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this fails on the last line when trying to deserialize with the error:\r\n> java.lang.ClassCastException: cannot assign instance of scala.collection.immutable.List$SerializationProxy to field Thing.things of type scala.collection.Seq in instance of Thing\r\n\r\nThis happens because of the way that ``List``'s are serialized. Rather than serializing the ``List`` directly, Scala instead serializes a ``SerializationProxy``. When this is deserializes, Java first deserializes the ``SerializationProxy`` and then Scala converts that deserialized object back to a List. This issue is that with Java's default deserialization, extra deserialization stuff goes on in between this the deserialization of the proxy and converting it to a List, which causes issues. Below is a summary of the steps that happen when we try to deserialize A:\r\n\r\n1. Deserialize A\r\n   1. Deserialize A.things\r\n      1. Create a SerializationProxy for A.things\r\n      1. Add the new SerializationProxy to a reference lookup table\r\n      1. Recursively deserialize the list contents\r\n         1. Deserialize B\r\n            1. Deserialize B.things\r\n               1. B.things is actually the same list reference that we added to the reference lookup table, so just set B.things to the value in that table, nothing extra to deserialize\r\n            1. B is done\r\n      1. The list contents are deserialized, build a new List from the deserialized SerializationProxy\r\n      1. Set A.things to that new List\r\n      1. Update the referenece lookup table to have the new List instead of the SerializationProxy\r\n      1. A.things is done\r\n   1. A is done\r\n \r\nSo the issue is that when B.things is set to the value in the lookup table, it is set to the SerializtionProxy beause it hasn't been replaced with the real List yet. This is where things fail because B.things is expecting to be set to a List and not a SerializationProxy, which is exactly what the error is saying.\r\n\r\nThis same kind of recursive back reference with shared Lists is exactly what's going on with the DPathElementCompileInfo (e.g ``Thing``) and the elementCompileInfos member (e.g. ``things``). We could maybe write custom serialization code to fix this, but I'm not sure I really want to maintain that. Maybe a simple alterantive is to just change elementCompileInfos so it isn't a List, but is instead an Array. This way we avoid this whole SerializationProxy stuff? Or I think we could clone the elementCompileInfos List. That way there would be no references to the same List, at the expense of extra memory usage.\r\n\r\nAny other thoughts? Maybe we need to rethink the parent backpointer in DPathCompileInfo, which I think is the root of the problem?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/829218933/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/829232458","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/542#issuecomment-829232458","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/542","id":829232458,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyOTIzMjQ1OA==","user":{"login":"stevedlawrence","id":3180601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODA2MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3180601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence","html_url":"https://github.com/stevedlawrence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-29T13:21:06Z","updated_at":"2021-04-29T13:21:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"+1\r\n\r\n-

There is no concept of sign-extending with a left shift, and unsigned/signed aren't treated differently because of this.\r\n\r\nIf we want to get explicit, we can maybe say something about zero bits are shifted in on the right and most significant bits shifted out are discarded.\r\n\r\nSo maybe something like this for left shift:\r\n> This is the \"logical\" shift left. The left-most bits shifted out are discarded. Zeros are shifted in for the right-most bits.\r\n\r\nNote that it does seem there *is* a concept of \"arithmetic\" left shift, but it's exactly the same as logical. So we could call this arithmetic if we wanted. But I think that is probably confusing, since arithmetic does imply sign-extension, which isn't a thing for left shift.\r\n\r\nFor consistency, we might also want to be explicit for xs:rightShift, e.g.:\r\n\r\n> This is the \"arithmetic\" shift right. The right-most bits shifted out are discarded. The sign bit is shifted in for the left-most bits. This means for signed primitives the values are sign-extended. If \"logical\" (zero-filling) shift right is needed, you must use unsigned primitives.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/846003071/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/846026369","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/550#issuecomment-846026369","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/550","id":846026369,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0NjAyNjM2OQ==","user":{"login":"Samarth08","id":17105953,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MTA1OTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17105953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samarth08","html_url":"https://github.com/Samarth08","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samarth08/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samarth08/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samarth08/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samarth08/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samarth08/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samarth08/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samarth08/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samarth08/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samarth08/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-21T15:16:59Z","updated_at":"2021-05-21T15:16:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I

However, I would say, that this pluggable XML readers stuff feels like stuff of a bygone era when everyone thought there would be competition around XML libraries, and pluggable XML technologies from vendors, etc. This seems silly in retrospect. But maybe it is needed for backward bug-for-bug compatibility in some cases.\r\n>\r\n>For us, I don't think pluggable XMLReader makes any sense.

As you said, we depend on very specific behavior from a specif XMLReader, so using something like ``SAXParserFactory.newInstance().newSAXParser().getXMLReader`` to get some XMLReader seems like a mistake. I'm wondering if there's a way to directly create a Xerces XMLReader. Maybe we should use the overloaded newInstance function that takes a class name? Or maybe we can directly create the right class ourselves, and avoid this pluggable logic? Then we really can assume that we have a certain XMLReader.\r\n\r\nWould it then even be possible to have a daffodil-lib function that gets the things XMLReader stuff we need and set the secure defaults, so there's only one place we need to call setSecureDefaults, with the assumptino that everything gets the XMLReader from our new daffodil-lib function?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/847015817/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/847018657","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/574#issuecomment-847018657","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/574","id":847018657,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0NzAxODY1Nw==","user":{"login":"stevedlawrence","id":3180601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODA2MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3180601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence","html_url":"https://github.com/stevedlawrence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-24T12:47:43Z","updated_at":"2021-05-24T12:47:43Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":" +1\r\n   \r\n - [X] **Do all automated continuous integration checks pass?**\r\n Yes\r\n - [X] **Is the update a patch, minor, or major update?**\r\n Patch update, small changes related to Scala 3.0, does not affect Daffodil\r\n - [X] **Is the license still compatible with ASF License Policy?**\r\n Yes, still MIT.\r\n - [X] **Have any changes been made to LICENSE/NOTICE files that need to be incorporated?**\r\n No changes to LICENSE.
