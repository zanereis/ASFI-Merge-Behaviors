Master branch, 4562ddd54917e611a47122bd502059e0889a76b9, is with this bug.\r\nI changed to v0.11 branch, 77c50791d4ee87544b04d8517941b437d8231f2f, which is without this bug.\r\n\r\nPS. Last message, the normal system is with both source installed python version and pip installed version. And, the pip version is v0.11r3 and has higher priority. The bug will appear on the normal system after the pip version is uninstalled.\r\n\r\nThis issue can be closed.\r\nThank you.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/335845238/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/335868045","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/7136#issuecomment-335868045","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/7136","id":335868045,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNTg2ODA0NQ==","user":{"login":"nikrao","id":19484204,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDg0MjA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19484204?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikrao","html_url":"https://github.com/nikrao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikrao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikrao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikrao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikrao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikrao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikrao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikrao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikrao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikrao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-11T16:28:44Z","updated_at":"2017-10-11T16:28:44Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@nm25tunn @mg0880gm was this issue resolved and the fix merged?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/335868045/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/335892007","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/8012#issuecomment-335892007","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/8012","id":335892007,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNTg5MjAwNw==","user":{"login":"mseeger","id":6508962,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MDg5NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6508962?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseeger","html_url":"https://github.com/mseeger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseeger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseeger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseeger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseeger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseeger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseeger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseeger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseeger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseeger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-11T17:45:50Z","updated_at":"2017-10-11T17:45:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@piiswrong: There is a pretty bad bug.

out part of the difference is because the broadcasting version is single-threaded. If I set the number of threads to 1, the difference is a bit smaller (~20x):\r\n```\r\n824 µs ± 44.9 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)\r\n7.01 ms ± 4.67 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)\r\n316 µs ± 850 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)\r\n```\r\nLooking at the assembly in perf this doesn't seem all that surprising. (array+scalar) are nice linear simd instructions, the broadcasting version is a mess involving lots of `div`s and `imult`s.
