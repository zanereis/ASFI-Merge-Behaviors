For example, in a bootstrap case, we may have topic **T** with a lot of data to copy and the other topics do not have much to catch up. At a certain point, what could happen is that all the 32 MB of memory is taken by topic **T** and that would be 2K batches for that topic assuming 16 KB batch size. In this case, the producer may still expire the batches even though the buffer pool is already small.\n\nAnother thing is that we actually allocate batches at `batch.size` granularity, even if the actual size of each batch is 3 KB, with default setting it will still take 16 KB from the buffer pool standpoint. So the default setting will only support 2K batches. It is usually too small for a high volume mirror maker.\n\nSo it is kind of hard to tune the buffer pool size because on one hand 32 MB may still not be small enough, but on the other hand the 32 MB is too small.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/249989441/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/249992417","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1897#issuecomment-249992417","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1897","id":249992417,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0OTk5MjQxNw==","user":{"login":"becketqin","id":5778611,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Nzg2MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5778611?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin","html_url":"https://github.com/becketqin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-27T20:43:29Z","updated_at":"2016-09-27T20:43:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@hachikuji Thanks for the review.

@junrao for review. The deadlock we're attempting to prevent occurs in the following scenario:\n1. Thread 1 acquires lock A and invokes `DelayedOperationPurgatory.watchForOperation` which attempts to synchronize on the internal list of watchers for the corresponding key.\n2. Thread 2 is holding the lock on the internal list of watchers for the same key and invokes `tryComplete` which attempts to acquire lock A.\n\nTo fix this generally, we should avoid holding any purgatory locks when invoking `tryComplete`. To accommodate this, I've changed the collection from a `LinkedList` to an immutable `Vector` which makes it safe to iterate over the operations and invoke `tryComplete` without a lock. \n\nThe main concern from an efficiency perspective is that we now need to do a copy when purging completed operations. My thought was that this would be OK in practice since delayed operations would tend to be completed together, but that may not always be true I guess for delayed fetches which have different `fetchMinBytes` requirements.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/250325122/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/250326314","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1904#issuecomment-250326314","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1904","id":250326314,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MDMyNjMxNA==","user":{"login":"granders","id":1295932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTU5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1295932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/granders","html_url":"https://github.com/granders","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granders/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granders/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granders/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granders/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granders/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granders/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granders/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granders/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granders/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-28T23:01:14Z","updated_at":"2016-09-28T23:01:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@apurvam Your branch builder job is now running [here](https://jenkins.confluent.io/job/system-test-kafka-branch-builder/562/console)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/250326314/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/250331206","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1897#issuecomment-250331206","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1897","id":250331206,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MDMzMTIwNg==","user":{"login":"becketqin","id":5778611,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Nzg2MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5778611?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin","html_url":"https://github.com/becketqin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-28T23:29:59Z","updated_at":"2016-09-28T23:29:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@hachikuji Done.
