This means, if there is an exception in the rmi thread that is executing the `beginLocalSampling` and `finishLocalSampling`, the samplers will continue to run indefinitely and this might cause issues. It would be best to instantiate Samplers on demand with a specific Duration. Each sampler can stop accepting new samples once the duration expires. This would also mean that you no longer have to keep enabling disabling samplers - allowing you to get rid of `enabled` and other internal state variables could be made immutable for example in `FrequencySampler`, `StreamSummary` can be declared as `final` and initialized in the constructor.\r\n\r\nIf you want all samplers to start sampling exactly at the same moment (not sure if that is a requirement) then you could potentially use a shared countdown latch. The thread instantiating the samplers can decrement it once it is done creating and initializing all samplers.

@ifesdjeen, I do like that the change reduces a possible source of user error of leaving gaps in the nodeId sequence, but I guard against that with an explicit runtime check.\r\n\r\nThe reason I use the map approach is so that if a user wants, they can specify exactly where each node is, so they know where `cluster.coordinator(nodeId)` runs from as they specified it, rather than having to either know that nodeIds are allocated in the order added and I think that gives tests a bit more clarity as to how things are allocated when the test needs more detail than the `withXXX` calls provide (or they don't want to iterate over the nodes to find where things are).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/comments/539215659/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/comments/539387309","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/354#issuecomment-539387309","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/354","id":539387309,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzOTM4NzMwOQ==","user":{"login":"ifesdjeen","id":12669,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12669?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ifesdjeen","html_url":"https://github.com/ifesdjeen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ifesdjeen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ifesdjeen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ifesdjeen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ifesdjeen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ifesdjeen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ifesdjeen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ifesdjeen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ifesdjeen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ifesdjeen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-08T07:36:56Z","updated_at":"2019-10-08T07:36:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"All

The node that receives the request is the proxy node and becomes the coordinator of the request.  Under normal operation the update gets sent to the three replica nodes and the coordinator receives the response from the three nodes satisfying the consistency level.  But suppose node B is down and unavailable.  The update is sent to nodes C and D and a response returned to the coordinator, again satisfying the consistency level of 2.   But that is not the end of the request. Because the replica mutation is meant for replica node B also, a hint is stored by the coordinator node in the local filesystem   indicating that the update or mutation is also to be replicated on node B.  The coordinator node waits for 3 hours by default (as set with ``max_hint_window_in_ms``). If node B becomes available within 3 hours the coordinator sends the hint to node B and the hint is replayed on node B, eventually making all replicas consistent. Such a transfer of an update using hints is called a hinted handoff.  Hinted handoff is used to ensure that read and write operations are not failed and the consistency, availability and durability guarantees are not compromised.  We still need to satisfy the consistency level, because hints & hinted handoffs are not used to satisfy the write consistency level unless the consistency level is ``ANY``.  If the replica node for which a hint is generated does not become available within 3 hours, or the ``max_hint_window_in_ms``, the hint is deleted and a full or read repair becomes necessary.\n\nA couple of suggestions:\n   \n   - I'd omit replication strategy and number of nodes in the cluster for this example, the only thing we need to know is that we have a LOCAL_QUORUM request going to three replicas and one of the replicas does not acknowledge the write.\n   - are not failed and the consistency, availability and durability guarantees are not compromised. I suggest you re-word this to something like \"hints ensure eventual consistency\".\n   - Can you structure this as an ordered timeline with a diagram instead of a large paragraph?

The composite `IMatcher` seems complicated. It allows end-users to add multiple filters that match the same condition, but the evaluation stops at the first one that returns `true`, i.e. drop the message. For instance, I can have `filter1: (1, 2, m) -> add_delay; return false`, `filter2:(1, 2, m) -> true`, and `filter3: (1, 2, m) -> add_m_to_list; return true` under `cluster.filters()`. When matching, the evaluation stops at filter2, and ignores filter3. so the code that `add_m_to_list` is not performed. \r\n2. Another thought regarding the goal here. Essentially, it is matching the condition and do interception upon matching. The interception runs **optional** custom code and at the end makes the decision to either return **DROP** or **PASS**. _From this perspective, drop is just a special form of intercept._  \r\n    a) If allowing multiple filters to match the same condition, there will be multiple decisions made from the corresponding filter. Ideally, there could be a resolver to come up with a final decision.
