This is a big improvement over your initial approach. It's still complex, though. There's an on going cost to complicating the code to this degree that would be good to minimize. \n\nOne big thing missing is an overview of all the moving parts. Perhaps that could live in BaseResultIterators? For example - this exception is thrown under these conditions and this state is added to the scan to know how to adjust the scan ranges, etc. etc. Especially that hasReferences bit in the coprocessor - what's that all about?\n\nI'd like to understand how ChunkedResultIterator complicates things too. I think it'd be ok to document that splits during aggregate queries aren't handled if your HBase version is less that XXX if it'd significantly simplify this patch (as that code is essentially deprecated). \n\nAnother potential, different approach would be for Phoenix to universally handle the split during scan case (rather than letting the HBase client scanner handle it for non aggregate case and Phoenix handle it for the aggregate case).

Committed the changes handling the review comments.\nRefactored the code and added code comments where ever possible. \n\nNow not handling the special cases required for ChunkedResultItertor. \n\nbq. Another potential, different approach would be for Phoenix to universally handle the split during scan case (rather than letting the HBase client scanner handle it for non aggregate case and Phoenix handle it for the aggregate case). Would that simplify things?\nNow throwing stale region bound exception all the cases when ever we get NSRE then phoenix client can handle the NSRE than hbase client handling with wrong region boundaries.\n\nThe ordered aggregate queries issue you are mentioning can be handled as part of other issue.\n\nPlease review the latest code.\nThanks.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/207582047/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/207591521","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/phoenix/pull/158#issuecomment-207591521","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/158","id":207591521,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNzU5MTUyMQ==","user":{"login":"samarthjain","id":1642180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDIxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1642180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarthjain","html_url":"https://github.com/samarthjain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarthjain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarthjain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarthjain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarthjain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarthjain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarthjain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarthjain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarthjain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarthjain/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-08T20:31:16Z","updated_at":"2016-04-08T20:31:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @churrodog.

Both in the \"uber\" (local job) mode and a normal tez task. There are.. subtleties between them, sadly (as sadly, I don't remember the specifics anymore).\n\nOther general thoughts:\n- The RecordUpdater implementation looks pretty cool. Didn't know they made this available for StorageHandlers.\n- Hive has a decent suite for running Hive tests as a part of their build (which includes tests for StorageHandlers) with this qtest/itest modules. You might be able to take some inspiration from these for testing.\n\nLooks good so far.
