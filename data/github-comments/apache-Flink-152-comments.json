We will later add support for non-equality predicate on left/right outer joins to master and include it for 1.3.0.\r\n\r\nRegarding the check, I agree with @wuchong. We implement these checks in  `RelOptRule.matches()` to prevent that an invalid plan is constructed. Otherwise it may happen that we end up with an invalid plan although, there would be a valid (but more expensive) alternative. We have additional checks in the DataSet operators to be on the safe side but these should never be triggered. If this happens, something is wrong with the optimization phase. So its kind of a safety net. Although, I don't think there are rules to generate alternative plans to execute an outer join with non-equality predicate, I would like to keep the pattern for consistency reasons. \r\nAlso the check in the validation phase of the Table API is useful, because the validation happens immediately when a function on a `Table` is called. In contrast, the check on `DataSetJoin` would happen when the translation is triggered, i.e., when the program is optimized and translated into a DataSet program. Throwing an exception early is helpful for users because they can much easier identify an invalid statement.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/273409877/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/273410864","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3145#issuecomment-273410864","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3145","id":273410864,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MzQxMDg2NA==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-18T08:15:46Z","updated_at":"2017-01-18T08:15:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks

For instance, we internal implemented a HbaseTableSource extends TableSource that can be joined as a TableSourceTable. We created a new rule that is used to match inner and outer joins. Though such special tableSource probably may not be suitable to be merged into Flink\r\nmaster, in the future there could be other TableSourceTables which can support different join predicates depending on their different physical storage characteristics.

We agreed that using a ByteBuffer and resizing it manually was a bit undesirable.\r\n\r\nInstead we opted for the following approach:\r\n* use DataOutputSerializer instead of DataOutputStream; it is a bit more efficient of strings, which make up the majority of serialized data, and is also backed by a resizing array\r\n* restructure the serialize methods to be symmetric with the deserialize methods\r\n* Access the metric values before serializing anything and reduce them to primitives or strings. The assumption is that if this succeeds the following serialization will succeed; and can only fail due to critical errors that will prevent serialization completely or programming errors on our part.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/273524937/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/273525369","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3150#issuecomment-273525369","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3150","id":273525369,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MzUyNTM2OQ==","user":{"login":"twalthr","id":5746567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDY1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5746567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr","html_url":"https://github.com/twalthr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-18T16:30:24Z","updated_at":"2017-01-18T16:30:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks

We have put some more thought on this offline too thanks to @gyfora ! The idea is that instead of putting records to each `ListState`, the output log is partitioned into multiple log \"slices\", one per concurrent checkpoint.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, the `UpstreamLogger` operator at the `StreamIterationHead` slices logs proportionally to the number of concurrent snapshots. This also allows committed output logs to be uniquely identified and cleared after each complete checkpoint. The design is based on the following assumptions:\r\n\r\n- A slice is named after a checkpoint ID. Checkpoint IDs are numerically ordered within an execution.\r\n- Each checkpoint barrier arrives back in FIFO order, thus we discard log slices in respective FIFO order.\r\n - Upon restoration the logger sorts sliced logs in the same FIFO order and returns an Iterable that gives a singular view of the log.\r\n\r\nBefore I polish this we need to close a memory leak. The `clear` operation of `State` cleans the state under the registered id but it does not seem to unregister the key itself. Does anyone have an idea on how to unregister state properly and generically (not backend specific)? Hope this gets some attention to wrap it up, it's been too long :). \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/273736660/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/273737541","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2885#issuecomment-273737541","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2885","id":273737541,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MzczNzU0MQ==","user":{"login":"vasia","id":498957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5ODk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/498957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia","html_url":"https://github.com/vasia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-19T10:29:40Z","updated_at":"2017-01-19T10:29:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @joseprupi, thank you for the PR!
