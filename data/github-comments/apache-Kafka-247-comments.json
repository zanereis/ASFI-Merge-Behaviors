For example, the callback's possible returned exceptions are listed in the javadocs:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhe exception thrown during processing of this record. Null if no error occurred.\r\n     *                  Possible thrown exceptions include:\r\n     *\r\n     *                  Non-Retriable exceptions (fatal, the message will never be sent):\r\n     *\r\n     *                  InvalidTopicException\r\n     *                  OffsetMetadataTooLargeException\r\n     *                  RecordBatchTooLargeException\r\n     *                  RecordTooLargeException\r\n     *                  UnknownServerException\r\n     *\r\n     *                  Retriable exceptions (transient, may be covered by increasing #.retries):\r\n     *\r\n     *                  CorruptRecordException\r\n     *                  OffsetMetadataTooLargeException\r\n     *                  NotEnoughReplicasAfterAppendException\r\n     *                  NotEnoughReplicasException\r\n     *                  OffsetOutOfRangeException\r\n     *                  TimeoutException\r\n     *                  UnknownTopicOrPartitionException\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not actually sure if all the above are possible, we could go over that in producer client internals; but for streams layer, some of the exceptions should never be expected (.e.g. `OffsetMetadataTooLargeException`) and if happens it would likely be a bug, while some others are possible to happen (e.g. `OffsetOutOfRangeException` if user configure the changelog mistakenly that log retention was too small). For different cases we could log a different error message and handle them differently.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/301613372/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/301616322","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2980#issuecomment-301616322","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2980","id":301616322,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMTYxNjMyMg==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-15T21:55:13Z","updated_at":"2017-05-15T21:55:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nRefer

Please let me know how to include this KIP 157 under main KIP for **config options for kafka tools**. As KIP 156 is also to add an option to reset tool. As if we include all KIP's related to tools under one main KIP, it will be easy to refer in future and also it will help further developers to use the similar naming convention for options in kafka tools.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/301665090/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/301667873","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/3064#issuecomment-301667873","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/3064","id":301667873,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMTY2Nzg3Mw==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-16T03:49:14Z","updated_at":"2017-05-16T03:49:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nRefer
