In Trident X represents a complete batch of data for processing.  A start point through to an end point.  In BEAM a CheckpointMark is just a place in the processing.  It is a spot where a checkpoint can be restored to.  There is no end to it, there is no batch.  I can turn it into a batch if I stop reading after some amount of time, or after a given amount of data, but then I am just at a new point.</p>\n\n<p>State/Sinks are another.  In Trident a State </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/storm-core/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/trident/state/State.java\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/storm-core/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/trident/state/State.java</a></p>\n\n<p>is a specific thing that can have data written to it and in some cases queried from it.  But ultimately it really just comes down to two APIs begineTransaction and commit transaction.  Transactions to state are guaranteed to be committed in order.</p>\n\n<p>Beam has not such concept the closest logically to it is a Sink, but a Sink is just for batch, in streaming you just use an idempotent ParDo. But in reality every ParDo offers similar lifecycle operations to a State.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/apache/incubator-beam/blob/master/sdks/java/core/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/transforms/DoFn.java\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/incubator-beam/blob/master/sdks/java/core/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/transforms/DoFn.java</a></p>\n\n<p>A DoFn runs inside a ParDo, and has APIs for startBundle and finishBundle.  A bundle is an arbitrary batch of data being processed, it seems that in streaming it is intended to be used around check-pointing, but there is no id like with state, so there actually is no guarantee of the order of processing.  In fact it is quite the opposite they want to be sure that ParDos can even run in parallel on different machines.</p>\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612904026/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612904029","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/5592#issuecomment-2612904029","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/5592","id":2612904029,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI5MDQwMjk=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-12T18:47:12Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T16:16:54Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=revans2\">revans2</a>:</i>\n<p><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=sriharsha\" class=\"user-hover\" rel=\"sriharsha\">Harsha</a>,</p>\n\n<p>Sorry I misread you original comment.

But I also see storm as a base platform that others can build APIs/Languages on top of.  If someone wants an X compatible API on top of storm we should encourage them, and possibly add in features to core storm to support them, but we don't necessarily pull them into our repo.  I see beam and SQL in this context.</p>\n\n<p>If you don't like trident, or think we can replace it with some changes to the normal storm API then lets think about what the correct API should be and implement it.  If beam really is the correct API and we don't think we can do better, then storm should look at becoming the reference implementation for open source beam, and we should deprecate both Trident and the core storm API.</p>\n\n<p>But I personally don't think it is.  From what I have seen the beam API is designed very much around ETL.  It does that very well.  It can handle complex windowing for you and make the job of most of my customers rather simple.  This is why I am exploring beam compatibility.  But in the case of micro services like what kafka streams appears to be targeting, or in the case IOT, is beam the right API for that?  It may grow up to be eventually, but right now it does not appear to be at all.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612904041/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612904046","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/5592#issuecomment-2612904046","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/5592","id":2612904046,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI5MDQwNDY=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-12T21:26:07Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T16:16:55Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=hmclouro\">hmclouro</a>:</i>\n<p>If it is at all possible unify the APIs for Storm and Trident that would be ideal in my opinion.

parity with beam and processing of late events, but we should also be aware of the extra complexities it will add in terms of buffering and tracking multiple windows. Custom triggers, eviction will be useful with single active window as well and may be much more simpler to add first. We should also try to make the trident implementation robust in terms of basic event time processing, time windows and address follow on JIRAs.</p>\n\n<p><a

I have a plan on how we could implement this, but honestly it is a different enough model from trident, that I don't think the two will be able to reuse code, like I stated before.  Additionally I have not dug into our windowing code to know how it might work with BEAM, so any feedback on how if it can be reused would be appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>Short term I would propose that we go ahead with a BEAM implementation that runs on storm, not trident.  Longer term I believe we should move towards a three tiered API approach.  This is what most compiler frameworks use, and I think makes a lot of since in this use case too.  </p>\n\n<p>The lowest level is like assembly language.  For storm this would be bolts, spouts, groupings, and possibly some other things around state, check-pointing and coordination.  This is what the worker and most of the scheduler sees and executes.</p>\n\n<p>There would also be an intermediate representation that describes the logical operations being performed.  These would be fairly simple logical operations link map, groupbykey, windowing, etc. An optimizer would take this as input and transform into an optimized solution.  Eventually this would be a cost based optimizer that would also take metrics from the running code + hints to understand where data is actually flowing, how skewed is the data, etc to improve the plan over time.  A \"compiler\" would then translate the optimized intermediate representation into the assembled topology.  The scheduler could then place the code physically on the cluster it is running on.</p>\n\n<p>High level languages like SQL, BEAM, Trident, etc. would translate their operations into the intermediate representation and submit it to nimbus for execution.  This would let us keep the regular storm API, but also be able to maintaqin a few \"standard\" high level languages and support multiple domain specific languages.</p>\n\n<p>BEAM design coming shortly.</p>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612904074/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612904081","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/5592#issuecomment-2612904081","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/5592","id":2612904081,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI5MDQwODE=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-16T14:55:00Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T16:16:55Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=revans2\">revans2</a>:</i>\n<p>BEAM logically has a few base transforms, that we need to support.  We can extend this in the future to support more if we need/want to.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><b>GroupByKey</b> - Groups by key and window</li>\n\t<li>CreatePCollectionView</li>\n\t<li>Read.Bounded - only for batch (which we probably can support, just not right now)</li>\n\t<li><b>Read.Unbounded</b></li>\n\t<li><b>ParDo.Bound</b></li>\n\t<li>ParDo.BoundMulti</li>\n\t<li><b>FlattenPCollectionList</b> - a merge of PCollections (Streams)</li>\n\t<li><b>Window.Bound</b></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>The <b>Bold</b> ones are what I think we should concentrate on first, and then we can add in support for side inputs and outputs in a second phase, and finally add in support for bounded \"batch\" processing if we see a need to.</p>\n\n<p>Like I stated before fault tolerance in an UnboundedSource is built around a checkpoint restore model.  While reading data we can ask the source for metadata that we can then use to restore the source back to a given point in time.</p>\n\n<p>Windowing in BEAM requires check pointing and is based around the concept of a pane (which is a part of a window) and triggers.  The GroupByKey transform is special in that it not only groups by a key, but also groups by a window.  To do this windowed data will not be emitted until a trigger fires to start the processing.  And even when the trigger fires there is a choice to discard the panes that have already been processed or to retain them until the trigger indicates that it will never fire again.  Triggers usually are based off of a watermark that comes from the source.</p>\n\n<p>All ParDos also have a concept around \"bundles\" that are batches of tuples being processed.  The DoFns can be informed of the start and end of a bundle, and in non-optimized cases will be recreated for each bundle.   </p>\n\n<p>When we combine all of this together, we need a way to checkpoint/restore all of the state in a consistent way across the entire topology, preferably coordinated with the bundles as well.  We could do this one of two ways.  The simplest approach would be to have a trident like coordinator that </p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Tells bolts to prepare for a new batch</li>\n\t<li>wait for ack</li>\n\t<li>Tells spouts to emit a new batch</li>\n\t<li>wait for ack</li>\n\t<li>Tells everyone to checkpoint</li>\n\t<li>wait for ack</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n<p>On success repeat. </p>\n\n<p>On failure:</p>\n<ol>\n\t<li>Tell everyone to roll back to last successful checkpoint</li>\n\t<li>Wait for ack</li>\n\t<li>Start again</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n<p>This would be a simple way to get things started, but it would be very slow because we cannot have more then one batch of tuples outstanding at any point in time, and even if we can combine a few steps together we will need at least two round trips through the topology to finish a batch.</p>\n\n<p>If we want to try and go faster it is going to require more of an exchange of metadata, and check-pointing similar to how flink or apex do it.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-master/internals/stream_checkpointing.html\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-master/internals/stream_checkpointing.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Perhaps this is something that we should think about once we have a prototype working with the first implementation.

For this I would propose that we have each Unbounded Source run as a spout.  All of the spouts would need to coordinate with each other so that the barriers can be emitted close to one another, reducing the amount of data that would need to be buffered.  We would also need coordination for restoring checkpoints.  For this I would propose that we use zookeeper for this.  Simply because it is already available and we would not need to add anything new to base storm to support it.</p>\n\n<p>All of the spouts would elect a leader through zookeeper.  The leader would then trigger all of the spouts to emit a barrier and checkpoint the spout metadata.  Because we are going to potentially have multiple checkpoints outstanding at any point in time we will need to label all of the checkpoints.  I would label them with two numbers.  The first would be the bundle/batch number, the second would be the replay, or generation number.  The bundle number would increment for each barrier emitted, but would role back on failure.  The generation number would increment for any failure.  This would allow downstream bolts to be able to restore a checkpoint just by seeing the bundle id.</p>\n\n<p>Spouts would have acking to know if a downstream tuple failed.  If an item fails the spout would inform the leader through zookeeper of the bad batch.  The leader would then inform all of the other spouts to restore and start again.</p>\n\n<p>Each spout would also have to inform the leader periodically when a batch is fully acked.  Once all of the spouts inform the leader that all of the tuples are emitted, then the leader can inform the spouts that they can delete the old checkpoints.  They should also inform the downstream bolts as part of the barrier so they can clean up their old checkpoints too.</p>\n\n<p>We can work out the exact details of how this will work later on.</p>\n\n<p>For the actual check pointing in the bolts only the GroupByKey transform would need to do anything, and for simplicity it would checkpoint each pane and key separately, so that the checkpoints are incremental, and so that we can support very large windows without too much difficulty.</p>\n\n<p>In general all of this seems totally doable, and actually not that difficult.  My biggest concern by far is around efficiency in the check pointing, especially for large windows.  The check pointing is something that we need to do, and in the common case should be thrown away.  So we want to be sure that we optimize for throwing the data away.  We can easily write something that can be backed by HBase or most any nosql store.  But that is going to add a lot of iops and network load that I am not too thrilled about.  But perhaps it does not really matter for an initial deployment.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612904093/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612904097","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/5592#issuecomment-2612904097","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/5592","id":2612904097,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI5MDQwOTc=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-16T15:53:54Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T16:16:56Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=revans2\">revans2</a>:</i>\n<p>Sorry about the long posts, but I think I am done and have most of what I have been thinking about this week out of my head.
