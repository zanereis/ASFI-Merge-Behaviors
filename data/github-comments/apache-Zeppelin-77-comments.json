care to elaborate on CI failure reason? (preferably, before the review)\n\nAlso, could you please explain why do you think this API change is valuable and what benefits does it bring for a user? (i.e does it consider other possible versioned storage i.e IPFS, BitTorrent and other future ones, where just an ID might not be enough? or it might be not String)\n\nRight now I'm under impression that narrowing public API of NotebokRepo to String vs generic Revision interface that any client is free to implement is not something very usefull or generic enough. \n\nI would prefer no making such changes to the public API for merele the sake of change, without a strong reason (which might very well exist but may be I'm missing

But String does the contrary. May be this class is even big enough to deserve his own file. And other clients may choose to replace it with their own implementations. I would understand if you suggest to extract it to the interface - this will bring even more flexibility (but increase verbosity). \n\nBut replacing it with the `String` does not look good to me.\n\nAfter some thinking - may be I lack verbal skills to convey the message about obejct-oriented design approach. If that is the case, please check `Item 50: Avoid strings where other types are more appropriate`, page 224 of \"Effective Java\" 2nd edition and let me know what you think.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/236570441/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/236571220","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1239#issuecomment-236571220","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1239","id":236571220,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNjU3MTIyMA==","user":{"login":"bzz","id":5582506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1ODI1MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5582506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz","html_url":"https://github.com/bzz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-01T12:48:52Z","updated_at":"2016-08-01T12:48:52Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Looks great to me.\n\nCI failure:\n\n```\n[INFO] Zeppelin: web Application ..........................

CI is failing, could you please post here the reason of failure? You can find it by browsing the logs of TravisCI. \n   \n   If you are sure that the reason of failure is not your code - please search project JIRA and check if that is something already known. (Issues with label `flaky-test` would be good candidates to check in case CI fails on some test)\n2. Every new file that you add must have an Apache 2.0 licence header at the beginning, same as all others - please add it\n3. Every dependency you add pom.xml need to be verified to have [Apache 2.0 compatible license](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)\n4. Every dependency you add pom.xml AND it's transitive dependencies which you can see with `mvn dependency:tree` will be part of the final release convenience binary so it's licenses must be recorded under [zeppelin-distribution/src/bin-license/LICENSE](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/zeppelin-distribution/src/bin_license/LICENSE)\n\nPlease address this feedback and I will look more
