May be we need to prepare some more elaborate test suite DAGs which cover all use-cases and code paths/api's ?\r\n\r\nI'm open to any refactoring ideas that you might have for the data generation, let me know when you have those thoughts more concrete and shareable.\r\n\r\nIntegrating azure pipelines and the test suite would be a good to close the loop on a first version of the test suite. Let's continue to focus on that (and Hudi with Flink of course :) ).\r\nCan you do another pass at the PR and see if there are any glaring open items (apart from the data generation refactor which I will let you do) that need work ? I can then take that up this week so hopefully in the next few days we have a PR ready to go through a final review process ?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/571389232/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/571389349","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/1194#issuecomment-571389349","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1194","id":571389349,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MTM4OTM0OQ==","user":{"login":"n3nash","id":2722167,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MjIxNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2722167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash","html_url":"https://github.com/n3nash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-07T01:20:22Z","updated_at":"2020-01-07T01:20:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Also, the tests seem to be failing, could you take a look ?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/571389349/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/571389593","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/1100#issuecomment-571389593","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1100","id":571389593,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MTM4OTU5Mw==","user":{"login":"n3nash","id":2722167,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MjIxNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2722167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash","html_url":"https://github.com/n3nash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-07T01:21:28Z","updated_at":"2020-01-07T01:21:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@yanghua Left a comment in the other PR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/571389593/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/571400738","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/1183#issuecomment-571400738","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1183","id":571400738,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MTQwMDczOA==","user":{"login":"wangxianghu","id":49835526,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5ODM1NTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49835526?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu","html_url":"https://github.com/wangxianghu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-07T02:11:52Z","updated_at":"2020-01-07T02:11:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @leesf, Thanks for your advice, i will fix it.
