+ endpoind。也就会出现奇怪的域名：dolphinscheduler.survey-minio.zxkw-local.com\r\n可能的解决方法：\r\n方法一：minio搭建的方式有问题，minio应该是可以支持这种倒装域名的\r\n方式二：升级hadoop-aws的版本到高版本，例如2.8.5，加入新的参数配置fs.s3a.path.style.access=ture，禁止倒装拼接域名\r\n\r\nI ran into the same problem and it is being solved. You can try to use the ip address directly, s3Endpoint=192.168.xxx.xxx:xxxx, it should work normally.\r\nReason: org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-ws:2.7.3\r\nIn the validIP() method of AmazonS3Client.java, it is mandatory to judge that the host of the endpoint must be an ip, not a domain name, otherwise the host will be flipped and spliced: bucket + endpoind. There will also be a strange domain name: dolphinscheduler.survey-minio.zxkw-local.com\r\nPossible solutions:\r\nMethod 1: There is a problem with the way minio is built, minio should be able to support this flipped domain name\r\nMethod 2: Upgrade the hadoop-aws version to a higher version, such as 2.8.5, add a new parameter configuration fs.s3a.path.style.access=ture, and prohibit flipping and splicing domain names","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/988431510/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/988433515","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/7236#issuecomment-988433515","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/7236","id":988433515,"node_id":"IC_kwDOClTkms466kxr","user":{"login":"putianhui","id":68322685,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MzIyNjg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68322685?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/putianhui","html_url":"https://github.com/putianhui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/putianhui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/putianhui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/putianhui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/putianhui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/putianhui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/putianhui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/putianhui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/putianhui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/putianhui/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-08T02:15:08Z","updated_at":"2021-12-08T02:15:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":">

Search before asking\n\n-[X] I had searched in the [issues](https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues?q=is%3Aissue) and found no similar issues.\n\n\n### What happened\n\nWhen the deployment is complete and the test sql_task is started\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88922651/145193653-b18a823a-dba1-4c54-88ac-a5cc40600839.png)\r\n\n\n### What you expected to happen\n\nThe resource registry can successfully connect to mysql, so it should be possible to execute sql_task.\n\n### How to reproduce\n\nAfter decompression, the mysql driver package has been manually added to the dolphinscheduler lib. After installation, the ds2 directory lib also has this driver package. The data source connection on the web interface can also be connected to mysql successfully, but the task is configured to the sql node It reports an error that there is no jdbc driver package.\n\n###

hi @baisui1981 , I think the `PIGEON` is a universal websocket way for DS, and TIS is one of the remote servers. So they are not the same thing. What do you think?\r\n\r\nThanks for your reply.Actually, I am the core developer of `PIGEON` node, When the initial PR was submitted, the node name was indeed called TIS, but it was changed to `PIGEON` because of the open source protocol of TIS is inconsist with apache2.\r\n\r\nyou can review the code [PigeonTask.java](https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/blob/11844415b0d71711ecc0942c0f55651b7db6fd83/dolphinscheduler-task-plugin/dolphinscheduler-task-pigeon/src/main/java/org/apache/dolphinscheduler/plugin/task/pigeon/PigeonTask.java#L77)\r\n,there are 3 steps to cooperate with outter system like TIS：\r\n- trigger a new job which is predefined in TIS.\r\n- poll the executing task status which is running in TIS. Quit once find  status is success or failure.\r\n- collect the job executing log by WebSocket（WebSocket is just one part of PIGEON）\r\n\r\nAll interface parameters interacting with TIS are deeply coupled with TIS. To be honest, it is difficult for PIGEON to have other application scenarios except docking with TIS, so I think it is appropriate to replace the name of PIGEON with
