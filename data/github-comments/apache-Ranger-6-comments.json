Charset changes in just one table may break JOIN operation or may result wrong output.\r\nSometimes, we set the Charset at Connection level in code , like we set to read using UTF-8, there it would break. \r\n\r\nMy input is, it should be defined at schema/DB  level ( may be using DB server configs), means same charset for entire Ranger.\r\n\r\nNow coming to Latin1, it will limit the characters that Ranger supports or will support in future. \r\n\r\nOn the second approach,  where you suggested to reduce the length of   trx_id(255), it may work. But if intention is to keep exact transactionId in the index, then it would be an issue. \r\n\r\nFew questions:\r\nWhat is the MySql version where you got this error ? What is default \"storage_engine\"? It should be 'InnoDb'. \r\n\r\nI am also exploring this and will add my input here.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ranger/issues/comments/2386359799/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ranger/issues/comments/2398947192","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ranger/pull/188#issuecomment-2398947192","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ranger/issues/188","id":2398947192,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVRaiM6O_Qd4","user":{"login":"jonashartwig","id":8947747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NDc3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8947747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonashartwig","html_url":"https://github.com/jonashartwig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonashartwig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonashartwig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonashartwig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonashartwig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonashartwig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonashartwig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonashartwig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonashartwig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonashartwig/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-08T06:19:47Z","updated_at":"2024-10-08T06:19:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"good to hear","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ranger/issues/comments/2398947192/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ranger/issues/comments/2399944965","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ranger/pull/400#issuecomment-2399944965","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ranger/issues/400","id":2399944965,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVRaiM6PDEEF","user":{"login":"simhadri-g","id":26441677,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDQxNjc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26441677?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/simhadri-g","html_url":"https://github.com/simhadri-g","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simhadri-g/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simhadri-g/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simhadri-g/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simhadri-g/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simhadri-g/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simhadri-g/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simhadri-g/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simhadri-g/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simhadri-g/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-08T14:01:54Z","updated_at":"2024-10-08T14:01:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@vperiasamy  can you please review the PR.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ranger/issues/comments/2399944965/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ranger/issues/comments/2408177776","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ranger/pull/402#issuecomment-2408177776","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ranger/issues/402","id":2408177776,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVRaiM6PieBw","user":{"login":"kumaab","id":16475454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDc1NDU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16475454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab","html_url":"https://github.com/kumaab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-11T22:04:57Z","updated_at":"2024-10-11T22:04:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @FerArribas14 for reporting the CVEs, from the description this seems to be too many issues to be tracked in a single PR.

```\r\n\r\nYou certainly can use 'if' inside RUN commands, the issue in this patch seems to be the missing `&&` to split `apt-get` and `update-java-alternatives`. When I created this PR I had already fixed the issue locally, but I used RUN with heredocs strings. Then I converted it to a retro-compatible version (by replacing the `RUN <<EOF` with a simple `RUN`) and I made this mistake. Thank you for fixing it
