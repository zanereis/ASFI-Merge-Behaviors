https://../invoke/html projects the 'html' field of the JSON object, and returns it as HTML.\n\nCase 3) involves magic -- we build in a convention that if a field is named 'html', then when we project it during a blocking call via GET, we return it as type HTML.    \n\nWe can add other conventions for other standard types, like images.\n\nWith this proposal, a GET on the html field of the following

@skaegi,\nyes, currently that's Bluemix specific code and you're right, that the auto-binding behaviour is not yet documented.\n\nFor this issue respectively the only \"workaround\" is to use an Org/Space combination in Bluemix where there are no `_` present in either organization or space name.\n\n**Auto binding in a nutshell:**\nCheck the [script to install the weather package](https://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk/blob/master/catalog/installWeather.sh#L15). It provides a parameter `bluemixServiceName` which is the service_name used in CloudFoundry (`weatherinsights`) in this case.\nThat value is actually the `label` attribute of said service in CloudFoundry, which can be obtained using the [CF Services API](https://apidocs.cloudfoundry.org/241/services/list_all_services.html) against Bluemix.

Also note that we still do not have a central notion of a \"namespace\" as in: Update one record to update the display name. That might become necessary, maybe it doesn't .\n\nTechnically we need a two way lookup:\n1. **uuid** to **namespace**: To be able to authenticate the user\n2. **namespace human-readable-name** to **namespace**: To be able to resolve human-readable-name to uuid to be able to fetch entities (given they are prefixed with uuid instead of human-readable-name)\n\nThe latter is problematic currently (maybe not, read below), because there are **N** subject entries resolving **namespace human-readable-name** to **namespace**. We could potentially use only the entry of the current subject (making it **(human-readable-name, subject)** to **uuid**) which kinda defeats that problem. But then we strike eventual-consistency because the current subject record might not have been updated with the information from CF (see the update mechanism outlined above).\n\nAfter all, having **N** entries resolving **namespace human-readable-name** to **namespace** might actually be not too problematic as that would _only_ induce, that we have a timeframe where two different names are resolved to the same uuid (this timeframe is the time it takes to update every single occurrence of the old name in the system to the new name in the system) which might be indefinite. Again this could be completely irrelevant as the records with the \"old\" name are unused anyway (as stated by the update mechanism outlined above) hence we could ignore/accept this fact.\n\nHaving written this down, it appeals to me that \"simply\" having a view from **namespace human-readable-name** to **namespace** is sufficient as it it embraces the eventual-consistency introduced by the lazy update mechanism anyway. It states, that the renamed namespace will become available in OpenWhisk as soon as the **first** subject record is updated in our database which strikes me as more useful than to introduce that inconsistency for each subject record on its own.\n\nMy proposal would then be:\n1. Use `namespaceUuid/actionName` internally, but the human-readable versions on the API side, resolve those internally using a view from **human-readable name** to **namespace** (thus **uuid**).\n2. Renaming as stated by @domdom82 only affects the display name and should be handled as an update rather than a delete/recreate. The space guid does not change on a rename.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/246174838/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/246197025","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/1238#issuecomment-246197025","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/1238","id":246197025,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NjE5NzAyNQ==","user":{"login":"csantanapr","id":1094878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTQ4Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1094878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr","html_url":"https://github.com/csantanapr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-11T18:52:56Z","updated_at":"2016-09-11T18:52:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@rabbah

There is one additional item that is not directly related to sequences, but it is useful to have before implementing sequences:\n1. Refactor code to include method for package resolution (i.e., fully resolved the actual package that a binding refers to) and method for generating all entities that need to be checked during entitlement check (this is also related to bindings and recursive bindings). \n\nA couple of other details that have been mentioned somewhere else:\n1. The logs of the sequence activation record will contain the activation ids of the actions that ran. \n2. The annotations of the sequence activation record will contain a field \"kind\" with the value \"sequence\" for an easy way of figuring out which activations come from sequences. \n\nWe also need to decide on how we count sequences toward DoS limits, e.g., do we count the sequence execution as +1 or +N where N is the number of actions that run as a result of invoking a sequence.
