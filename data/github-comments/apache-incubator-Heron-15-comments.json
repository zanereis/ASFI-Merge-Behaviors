Yes, MesosLauncher is pretty much based off Heron’s basic LocalLauncher, therefore it launches SchedulerMain process within itself. It has a parameter `heron.scheduler.background` to regulate whether to launch it in a default LocalLauncher fashion in a background, or to launch in a foreground. The big picture idea is that the users who use Mesos on their clusters will most probably want to use some high level Mesos scheduler to have Heron-Mesos scheduler itself under some sort of Mesos supervision. If we go back from where we started, Heron Mesos scheduler, that was initially provided from the Twitter side, had a high level Mesos scheduler for launching an arbitrary tasks, and it was used by MesosLauncher to submit topologies to. This didn’t look easy to setup and launch comparing to other Heron schedulers, so we gave up this approach in favor of preserving the simplicity of launching topologies via `heron submit` command. And yes, after launching HTTP server and Tmaster, it launches other containers on slaves.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/224933437/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/224983583","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/issues/504#issuecomment-224983583","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/504","id":224983583,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNDk4MzU4Mw==","user":{"login":"billonahill","id":23758,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNzU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23758?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill","html_url":"https://github.com/billonahill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-09T18:24:38Z","updated_at":"2016-06-09T18:24:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Issue #893 is to add maven publish process to the release process.

I'm not sure if theres a list of the minimum config thats needed to actually run the heron cli. If you turn on the debug logging when running a cli command you can see it checking to see if theres a list of config files and if they are not there it just continues.

Secondly we should either supply defaults or fail the command if a required config file does not exist. In this case we could default to the NullUploader in the event that the uploader.yaml file is not supplied which would circumvent the exception case. I still think making the exception better is worthwhile because if the class for the uploader is provided but mistyped they'll still hit that exception path.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/224993722/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
