In [src/relay/pass/fuse_ops.cc](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/master/src/relay/pass/fuse_ops.cc#L263), we have a visitor which takes TupleGetItemNode, and continues visiting the supposedly inner tuple node. \r\n```\r\nvoid VisitExpr_(const TupleGetItemNode* op) final {\r\n    CHECK(graph_.node_map.count(op));\r\n    Node* node = graph_.node_map.at(op);\r\n    this->Update(op->tuple, node, kOpaque);\r\n    ExprVisitor::VisitExpr_(op);\r\n    this->AddNode(op);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nBut it looks like the visitor does not visit the tuple node after visiting TupleGetItemNode above ([this function](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/master/src/relay/pass/fuse_ops.cc#L248) is never called). In fact, op->tuple in the above snippet seems to be a CallNode, the output of split op [in this line](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/master/python/tvm/relay/op/transform.py#L542). \r\n\r\nIs this behavior expected?

Normally in our existing frameworks we do stuff like batching the entire gate computation into a single X * k * D gemm (for k = 3 for GRU, 4 for LSTM, etc).\r\n\r\nThis has the problem that (once you can fuse with split), that to compute the gate values you inspect at D-strided locations in the output, and so in practice you end up fully realizing that intermediate computation. It may be probably more natural to instead reorder the single GEMM into vector-width blocked variants (i.e. instead of a (kD, D) matrix you'd reorder it into a ((D // V) x k x V,  D) and then realize it at (k, V)-sized locations.

That way we will generate actual engineering metrics of the difference between a stack-based and a register-based VM. The engineering dependencies are too complex to productively discuss without actually going through the implementation. The arguments that @jroesch presented, i.e. the stack VM simplifies the instruction management, and the fact that you would need to unroll to discover how operators interact was considered acceptable given the fact that most concurrency is expected to be in the operators themselves. \r\n\r\nWhat the stack vs register organization does to the complexity of resulting compiler analysis code in the context of tensor compositions I think is an open question that can only be answered by doing both implementations. The beauty of that approach is that it will generate a level set of these questions and will offer many an opportunity to publish the results and go on to lucrative commercial engagements as one of the few people in the world that actually has the engineering know-how about the technical details.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/477294221/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/477299643","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2714#issuecomment-477299643","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2714","id":477299643,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NzI5OTY0Mw==","user":{"login":"MarisaKirisame","id":3397377,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzOTczNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3397377?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame","html_url":"https://github.com/MarisaKirisame","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-27T18:45:21Z","updated_at":"2019-03-27T18:45:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@wweic good catch, that is indeed incorrect. can you give me the offending test?

We break it into two points:\r\n\r\n- (1) Register vm allows easier dataflow discovery\r\n- (2) Dataflow parallel discovery can be done at a higher or lower level and do not have things to do with VM\r\n\r\nIn our case, most people can agree on (1) but not necessarily (2). This way, we can find what we actually agree on more and move on from that point. I do think we should aim to have only one version of VM after we agree on things. Mainly because it is a better way to have the community pushing for a consistent technical direction.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/477346122/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/477353334","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/2897#issuecomment-477353334","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2897","id":477353334,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NzM1MzMzNA==","user":{"login":"kazum","id":812126,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMjEyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/812126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum","html_url":"https://github.com/kazum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-27T21:24:24Z","updated_at":"2019-03-27T21:28:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think we cannot detect the OpenCL version statically - we need to query it with the OpenCL APIs.

yes, fusing dense with split + other ops should be possible in principle, but our fusion algorithm is implemented such that dense and other \"complex\" ops (conv, pooling etc.) can only be fused with
