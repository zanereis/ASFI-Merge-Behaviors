In this example, I don't set a password on node 2, but I do on nodes 1 and 3:\r\n\r\nThe docs specify that the `enable_cluster` action, using the same admin username and password, must happen on every node in the cluster, so I don't understand why you skipped node 2 here. I definitely would not expect that to work in general.\r\n\r\n> Now I proceed to join the nodes into the cluster. Node 2 goes as expected:\r\n\r\nBut the command you show is\r\n```\r\ncurl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" http://admin:password@localhost:15984/_cluster_setup -d '{\"action\": \"enable_cluster\", \"bind_address\":\"0.0.0.0\", \"username\": \"admin\", \"password\":\"password\", \"port\": 25984, \"node_count\": \"3\", \"remote_node\": \"127.0.0.1\"}'\r\n```\r\nwhich is the same \"enable_cluster\" action as used previously on nodes `couchdb1` and `couchdb3`, and is effectively setting the password on that node. When you write \"join the nodes\", I was expecting the \"add_node\" action, which is responsible for making sure the cookies are the same and starting Erlang distribution, etc.\r\n\r\nFor the second example using different admin users, the docs seem fairly clear to me that it should actually be the same admin user for each node, so I wouldn't expect that to work.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSo, here's my simple minded summary of how we expect users to set up a cluster:\r\n\r\n1. Each node in turn is sent a request with the `enable_cluster` action using identical admin usernames & passwords:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" http://localhost:15984/_cluster_setup -d '{\"action\": \"enable_cluster\", \"bind_address\":\"0.0.0.0\", \"username\": \"admin\", \"password\":\"password\", \"node_count\":\"3\"}'\r\ncurl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" http://localhost:25984/_cluster_setup -d '{\"action\": \"enable_cluster\", \"bind_address\":\"0.0.0.0\", \"username\": \"admin\", \"password\":\"password\", \"node_count\":\"3\"}'\r\ncurl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" http://localhost:35984/_cluster_setup -d '{\"action\": \"enable_cluster\", \"bind_address\":\"0.0.0.0\", \"username\": \"admin\", \"password\":\"password\", \"node_count\":\"3\"}'\r\n```\r\nAt this point, we expect the salts to differer on all nodes. One thing that's confusing about the docs is that they specify using a username:password in those commands, but that would not work if no admin passwords have been configured in e.g. local.ini. Maybe we should remove those creds from the docs if we're assuming no previously configured admins?\r\n\r\n2. The \"coordinator\" node is sent requests to join with the other nodes in the cluster. In this example, the node listening on 15984 is coordinating:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" http://admin:password@localhost:15984/_cluster_setup -d '{\"action\": \"add_node\", \"host\":\"127.0.0.1\", \"port\": 25984, \"username\": \"admin\", \"password\":\"password\"}'\r\ncurl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" http://admin:password@localhost:15984/_cluster_setup -d '{\"action\": \"add_node\", \"host\":\"127.0.0.1\", \"port\": 35984, \"username\": \"admin\", \"password\":\"password\"}'\r\n```\r\nNote that we're using the admin creds set in previous \"enable_cluster\" actions\r\n\r\n3. The coordinator node is sent a final request/action to \"finish_cluster\", which basically ensures the system dbs are created.\r\n```\r\ncurl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" http://admin:password@lcoalhost:15984/_cluster_setup -d '{\"action\": \"finish_cluster\"}'\r\n```\r\nBy extending the functionality of this request we could sync the admin passwords configured in the \"enable_cluster\" requests. However, if we don't also configure a common salt among nodes, subsequent admin users created with e.g. `rpc:multicall(config, set, [\"admins\", \"my-admin\", \"pass\"]).` will not have the same salt/hashes on all nodes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/445957407/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/445970974","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/1800#issuecomment-445970974","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1800","id":445970974,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NTk3MDk3NA==","user":{"login":"eiri","id":70542,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNTQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70542?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiri","html_url":"https://github.com/eiri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiri/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-10T21:00:32Z","updated_at":"2018-12-10T21:00:32Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@van-mronov This is what this PR is about.

Why are we bothering to pass in both a `username/password` and `remote_current_user/password` pair if we require everything to be identical on all nodes? I would have thought that the `username/password` pair is the admin user we are trying to create everywhere, and the `remote_current_user/password` pair is the pre-existing admin user on that remote node we need to use to affect change on that node.\r\n\r\n    1. In an ideal world, assuming these two pairs of data are allowed different, why couldn't the `remote` version be some unique auto-generated set of creds on every node? I'm looking towards CouchDB 3.0 where we intend to completely remove admin party. In this situation, nodes will stand up with an arbitrarily generated admin/password pair, and there is no way (short of pre-seeding your own `local.ini` file) that Couch could possibly know `a priori` what the eventual cluster's admin/password pair would be. **But**, if it printed out its randomly generated u/p on startup (similar to how `dev/run` does it), that info could be gathered by a script or a human and plugged into the cluster wizard on setup. These would be the `remote` credentials, and the primary `username/password` pair passed in via JSON would be the newly created admin user, with the unified salt. (The wizard could then *also* remove the autogenerated u/p credentials, as a bonus feature to be added later.)\r\n\r\n    2. Assuming for whatever reason we don't want to do 1, why are we even bothering to pass in 2 sets of credentials, if the only way this works is if we forcibly manually set the creds on every node to be identical at the start? I notice you've removed the second set of credentials in your example, but that still has confusion with the difference between the two sets of creds - if we're forcing it via the first step, why bother even supporting passing them in?\r\n\r\n2. The situation where a different admin password is set on a node and I forgot to pass in the correct `remote_current_user/password` should have been an error, no? It shouldn't have been able to make *any* change to that remote node. And yet we got back an `{\"ok\":true}`. That's got to be wrong.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/445977015/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/446001828","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/1800#issuecomment-446001828","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1800","id":446001828,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NjAwMTgyOA==","user":{"login":"van-mronov","id":550254,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDI1NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/550254?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/van-mronov","html_url":"https://github.com/van-mronov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/van-mronov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/van-mronov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/van-mronov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/van-mronov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/van-mronov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/van-mronov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/van-mronov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/van-mronov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/van-mronov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-10T22:40:25Z","updated_at":"2018-12-10T22:40:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@eiri yeah, I mean if pass `--only basics` to `tests` option will it pass further as `mix test --only basics`?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/446001828/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/446005878","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/1800#issuecomment-446005878","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1800","id":446005878,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NjAwNTg3OA==","user":{"login":"eiri","id":70542,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNTQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70542?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiri","html_url":"https://github.com/eiri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiri/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-10T22:55:36Z","updated_at":"2018-12-10T22:55:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I don't know, but by a look at the code I don't see why it wouldn't.

However, perhaps the most significant difference between \"direct\" and \"remote\" cluster enabling, is that the latter [uses the password hash](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/blob/master/src/setup/src/setup.erl#L115-L120), which I _finally_ understand is how @janl claims that synced password hashes are already fixed. But since it only works for \"remote\" cluster enabling, is not well documented, and doesn't sync hashes for admin users added subsequent to cluster setup, it could perhaps still use some improvement.\r\n\r\nAnyway, to try to address @wohali's questions:\r\n\r\n> Why are we bothering to pass in both a username/password and remote_current_user/password pair if we require everything to be identical on all nodes? \r\n\r\nIt appears that we're trying to handle a situation where known admin creds may already exist on the nodes. In that case, we'd need to use those creds either in a basic auth header if we're making direct requests, or setting them as `remote_current_user/password` in the case when the [coordinator is making the requests](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/blob/master/src/setup/src/setup.erl#L98-L113). \r\n\r\n> I would have thought that the username/password pair is the admin user we are trying to create everywhere, and the remote_current_user/password pair is the pre-existing admin user on that remote node we need to use to affect change on that node.\r\n\r\nThat is my understanding as well.\r\n\r\n> In an ideal world, assuming these two pairs of data are allowed different, why couldn't the remote version be some unique auto-generated set of creds on every node?\r\n\r\nI think they could.\r\n\r\n> Assuming for whatever reason we don't want to do 1, why are we even bothering to pass in 2 sets of credentials, if the only way this works is if we forcibly manually set the creds on every node to be identical at the start? \r\n\r\nI assume the idea is that the remote creds (and basic auth header for coordinator) are to be used for existing admin user(s), if any, but the \"username\" and \"password\" fields are for a single, new admin user common to all nodes. I think this interpretation is supported by how the \"remote\" enable_cluster uses the [existing admin user's hash](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/blob/master/src/setup/src/setup.erl#L115).\r\n\r\n> I notice you've removed the second set of credentials in your example, but that still has confusion with the difference between the two sets of creds - if we're forcing it via the first step, why bother even supporting passing them in?\r\n\r\nI think I answered that already. Please LMK though if it's not clear.\r\n\r\n> The situation where a different admin password is set on a node and I forgot to pass in the correct remote_current_user/password should have been an error, no?

my experience, the biggest problem with couchdb on docker or even my laptop is the q and n values in the clustering section of configuration. @janl pointed me in this direction during an IRC debug session and it has helped tremendously. \r\n\r\nThere is some documentation here:\r\nhttp://docs.couchdb.org/en/2.2.0/config/cluster.html\r\n\r\nBut I am still not quite sure how best to setup the q and n values for smaller standalone instances. Here's my simplistic logic (call it cowboy configuration for couchdb), that I would love to have checked/improved:\r\n\r\n1) Keep n (the number of replicas) at 1. This is the default, and the defaults seem to be for \"beefy servers\". We can't go any lower, so 1 it is. Want extra redudancy? - go higher, but I don't know how you would take advantage of this in case a disk died. Seems like it is easier to just replicate data to a backup server.\r\n\r\n2) For maximum efficiency let q (number of shards) equal the number of CPU cores on the device. If it's on your laptop and you don't want couchdb to slow down other stuff, make it a few less. On the other hand, if it's a dedicated couchdb instance I expect that threading means you could actually squeeze a bit more efficiency giving yourself one more q than the number of cores, but that is a guess.\r\n\r\n(I had to do some research to understand what CPU cores means relative to the output of `cat /proc/cpuinfo` . On my laptop I have 8 processors - and each processor entry shows 4 \"cpu cores\". I believe this means the ability to index 8 views in parallel (if there are 8 shards). It doesn't mean 32 as the 8 processors are distributed over the 4 cores. I conservatively went with q=2, the default of 8 seemed to slow things down when I had lots of concurrent replications running. An AWS instance I use for production shows 2 processors and 2 cores.

If you use the Setup Wizard (either through Fauxton or the cli) and tell it you only have a single node, you will get `n=1`. The preferred deployment scenario for CouchDB 2.x is a minimum of 3 servers and `n=3` for full redundancy. This is far superior to using 2x `n=1` servers and replicating between them as we did in 1.x for many reasons that I'm not going to go into right now.\r\n\r\nAs for `q`, Jan's advice is correct. The default `q=8` value was chosen because servers at the time tended to have 4 cores with 2 threads each. This matches well with multiple spindles, or a single SSD, for performance. (Remember that disk performance also is a critical factor for view building). Finally, if you don't make much use of JS views, or have migrated off onto the higher-performance Mango, you need less CPU, and the sharding will definitely improve your performance.\r\n\r\nAs always, before putting anything into production, **test**.  :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/1280565723/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/447523089","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/1811#issuecomment-447523089","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1811","id":447523089,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NzUyMzA4OQ==","user":{"login":"wohali","id":112292,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjI5Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112292?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali","html_url":"https://github.com/wohali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-15T01:08:32Z","updated_at":"2018-12-15T01:08:32Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"While I was in `mem3_httpd` I noticed the (currently undocumented) `/{db}/_shards` and `/{db}/_shards/{docid}` endpoints.\r\n\r\nWe should document these.\r\n\r\nI dithered briefly over putting this new endpoint at `/{db}/_shards/_sync`.

There are thousands and thousands of use cases for couchdb and at least as many good configurations per scenario. I have been working with couchdb for almost 10 years, and I still don't have a good sense for an optimal deployment strategy for my sort of projects (10-100 pouchdb clients filter replicating data to/from couchdb a few times per day, with somebody analyzing the resulting data in couchdb a few times per week). Since I started with single server couchdb, and because I haven't seen any data about performance advantages of multiple servers (redundancy is nice, but daily snapshots are usually enough for me), and because orchestrating multiple servers is hard (using docker could simplify this, but I and others have seen poor performance (total lockup of machine) on docker)... I've just been using a single couchdb server even though I am now deploying couchdb 2.3.0.\r\n\r\nSo going back to the title of this issue - what is the ideal configuration for low spec HW? Or rather than saying low spec hardware - what about saying $45/month (arbitrarily chosen) hardware budget? Is a single instance (with the right q value) close enough to ideal? Will performance be substantially different if you get 3 - $15/month servers and set them up as a cluster? Given the availability of low cost ARM servers (on AWS or even Raspberry Pi stacks) are 5 servers better than 1 that's five times as fast? Given Erlang's focus on parallelization (and the idea behind map/reduce in general) I have a hunch that more cheap servers will give more performance per dollar than a single beefier server - but I don't know how much and if it is worth the added complexity. Has anybody tried to benchmark this?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/1280565728/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/447561613","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/1799#issuecomment-447561613","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1799","id":447561613,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NzU2MTYxMw==","user":{"login":"janl","id":11321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl","html_url":"https://github.com/janl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-15T11:28:19Z","updated_at":"2018-12-15T11:28:19Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Good point about the VDU.
