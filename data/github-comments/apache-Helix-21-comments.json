Although each of the fixes improves the whole system a little bit, the problem has not been completely fixed yet.\r\nHere's the latest theory (new findings).\r\n1. The current way of closing an async stage (EV update stage) execute thread is to interrupt it. However, since the default implementation of the task swallows the interruptedException, the thread will be kept alive.\r\n2. From the admin thread perspective, it shuts down the async stage threads and then cleans up all the monitors. The assumption is that after the async stage threads are all closed, there won't be anyone adding new metrics. So the cleanup of the monitors should be clean.\r\n3. However, due to the issue in point one, an EV update stage thread may still executing. It is possible that we have a race condition when an EV update stage event is being executed while the main thread is closing the monitors. If the closing of Resource Monitor happens earlier than the EV event processing, then the EV event processing will recreate a new Resource Monitor. \r\n \r\nThis mainly causes problems in the test.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/850746227/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/850771875","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/helix/issues/1768#issuecomment-850771875","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/1768","id":850771875,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg1MDc3MTg3NQ==","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-29T05:10:29Z","updated_at":"2021-05-29T05:10:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This test fails in: https://github.com/apache/helix/actions/runs/887454381","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/850771875/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/852364339","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/helix/issues/1768#issuecomment-852364339","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/1768","id":852364339,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg1MjM2NDMzOQ==","user":{"login":"NealSun96","id":18000949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDAwOTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18000949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96","html_url":"https://github.com/NealSun96","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-01T18:51:01Z","updated_at":"2021-06-01T18:51:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Assign to me!

My only concern is that perhaps with some unforeseen errors, we will get an APIERROR which is unrelated to the main cause, but for current usages that doesn't seem to be the case so this looks good to me.\r\n\r\nThanks for the review. For the uncertain future, my thought is that we should avoid invading into the KeeperException.Code space. Note that in the newer ZK version, they are extending the error codes. If there is a conflict, then we do not have a solution.\r\nThe right way, IMO, is add another layer of information as a supplement to the official ZK error code. I can imagine that we extend the KeeperException.Code class and add our field to it so as to indicate our detailed APIERROR. This is safer and can avoid conflict.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/853441034/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/853441148","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/helix/pull/1778#issuecomment-853441148","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/1778","id":853441148,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg1MzQ0MTE0OA==","user":{"login":"jiajunwang","id":1803880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDM4ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1803880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang","html_url":"https://github.com/jiajunwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-02T23:12:06Z","updated_at":"2021-06-02T23:12:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Approved
