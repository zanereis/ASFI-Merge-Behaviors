on this PR since it has been open for awhile.  This was some good work by mktal to build a multi-class svm module.\r\n\r\nThe issue with the PR is that the mini-batching is embedded in the svm code, whereas we would prefer to add mini-batching as a general capability in the stochastic gradient descent framework, so that it can be used by other modules besides.\r\n\r\nThere is work in progress on this currently:\r\n\r\nAdd mini-batching to IGD framework\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MADLIB-1048\r\nfor the next release.\r\n\r\nWhen that JIRA is done, we can then finish:\r\n\r\nMulti-class SVM with mini-batching\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MADLIB-1037\r\n\r\nwhich is related to this PR.  @rahiyer may have more color to add as
