If it would be easier, I can also try to break it into a sequence of smaller PRs, one part at a time; for instance, a first part about reading and writing the literals, a second part that adds the functions (cdt:get, cdt:size, etc), a third one that adds the FOLD aggregate, etc. Let me know if you would prefer such a step-wise process.\r\n\r\nBreaking into smaller PRs might be useful and likely make it easier to review.  However large features can arrive in a single PR (like the recent `jena-ontapi` PR) if that is the most appropriate way to contribute them.

The rebased current PR seem to have conflicts all seem to be not between main and the PR but within the PR's history - which I can't explain.\r\n\r\nHowever, the rebasing on the PR has also made that unnecessary.\r\n\r\nWhen we're ready to merge, simply take diff of the current the PR (the URL is https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/2501.diff), start a new branch in your repo `git apply the patch` and make a new PR - single commit, with you as author.\r\n\r\nNow, thinking about the contribution --\r\n\r\nThere are two considerations:\r\n\r\n* The majority of Jena users are depending on Jena's stability, including performance.\r\n* There is a need to have ways to get RDF/SPARQL emerging ideas into the wider field for practical experience.\r\n\r\nThere is a realistic chance that SPARQL-CDTs will evolve and that may be in incompatible ways. By being clear this is \"experimental\", I don't think that is a problem if not using the features means no impact. I (non-PMC chair opinion) am keen to see new tech being available to users, `LATERAL` being a recent example. (Disclosure: Olaf and I are both involved in RDF 1.2 where issues of evolution are important.)\r\n\r\nPerformance:\r\n\r\nThere is one place that needs investigation that I have found so far which is the mixes this - `CDTAwareParserProfile` is on the critical path for all parsing whether CDT's are used or not.\r\n\r\nThe subclass quickly tests whether to invoke the superclass but parsing is sensitive to the JIT ptimizer. Parsing runs at about one/two microseconds per triple which isn't that many instructions and the new may\r\nchange what optimizations the JIT performs. \r\n\r\nIt may well make no measurable difference because the optimizer nowadays has ways to implement virtual method calls as direct function calls. The only way to find out is to try.\r\n\r\nFunctionality:\r\n\r\nWhile CDTs are experimental, and likely to change, Jena needs a way to test teh functionality it ships and\r\nit does that by running test suites every build. An Apache project is more than open source - the code needs to be able to build. Jena releases the repository source tree - the binary artifacts (\"convenience binaries\") are secondary.\r\n\r\nFor the stability, PRs needs tests and there aren't any in this PR. I see that there are [AWSlabs SPARQL-CDTs manifest-driven tests](https://github.com/awslabs/SPARQL-CDTs/tree/main/tests) (Apache Licensed).

I knew that Stardog had something similar, but I wasn't aware of this blog post. Looking at it now, I see some relevant differences: The Stardog approach changes the notion of a solution mapping by extending the co-domain of these mappings with two new kinds of elements (namely, solution mappings themselves, which makes the notion recursive, and some kind of array). While I cannot find any formal specification of this approach, I can see that extending the definition of solution mapping in the SPARQL spec in this way would have a wide-ranging impact on most of the formal parts of the spec (the definition of _every_ operator that processes solution mappings would need to be adapted). In contrast, adding a new operator (UNFOLD) and a new aggregation function (FOLD), as done by our approach, would be a comparably modest change/extension to the SPARQL spec (and we already provide all relevant parts of this extension explicitly in our SPARQL CDTs spec, ready to be copied directly into the SPARQL spec; rather than having \"only\" an implementation of an idea described informally in a blog post). Moreover, the relationship between Stardog's approach (which seems to be only about SPARQL) and the RDF data model is also not clear to me from the blog post (e.g., what happens if a solution mapping that contains such an array or a nested solution mapping is passed to a CONSTRUCT pattern?), whereas our approach is simply based on RDF literals and, thus, is clearly within the realm of RDF as is.\r\n\r\n> * why do we need cdt:List and cdt:Map when the syntax already decides the object type (cf. in JenaX we have a single JSON data type)\r\n\r\nSome vendors may choose to support only one or the other. Moreover, a potential future addition may be a cdt:SortedMap datatype which would likely have the same lexical space as cdt:Map, or a cdt:Set (as you mention JenaX has).\r\n\r\n> I am particularly curious about the changes to the SPARQL standard without providing a generic solution. Broadly speaking, the CDT proposal suggests two new keyword `FOLD` and `UNFOLD`, whereas the first is an aggregate function operator with the additional support for `ORDER BY`, and the latter is a custom operator which seems to me like a special case implementation of multi-binding BIND (https://github.com/w3c/sparql-dev/issues/6) for cdt:Lists.\r\n>\r\n> However, we could use both kinds of types for many purposes. I want to list some\r\n> \r\n> `ORDER BY` in aggregate functions: [...]\r\n\r\nOur spec contains all the relevant parts to define `ORDER BY` as a generic addition to be used also by other aggregation functions, and the code in this PR has everything needed to implement such a generic `ORDER BY` for arbitrary aggregation functions.

So I'm assuming you are controlling the RDF production and setting the blank node label yourself.\r\n\r\nThe `RDFWriter` builder doesn't currently provide a way to set the `NodeFormatter`. It would be good to add this. \r\n\r\nIf you want to read such data in, and preserve the label (with care!), then use `RDFParser.create().labelToNode(labelToNode)` with `LabelToNode.createUseLabelAsGiven()`. Your code is responsible for blank node label uniqueness and the rules about what happens on graph merge and reading files multiple times.\r\n\r\nFor writing: `NodeFormatter` is the interface for controlling the RDF term output.\r\n\r\n In extending `RDFWriterBuilder`, interfaces `WriterGraphRIOT` and `WriterDatasetGraphRIOT`, the low level per-format interfaces, will need changing.\r\n\r\nThere several kinds of writer for the N-Triples/Turtle family of syntax - streamed, flat, batching and collecting - all use a `NodeFormatter`. \r\n\r\nAt the `RDFWriter` level, there isn't the \"writer profile\" abstraction like there is when reading (where there is a node maker `FactoryRDF` carried by `ParserProfile`).\r\n\r\nN-Quads is the simplest output form. It is streamed and uses `WriterStreamRDFPlain`.\r\n\r\nBelow is the code that is used for N-Quads. You could use that, modified at `NodeFmtLib.encodeBNodeLabel` to just use the label. Be careful - some characters aren't legal in a blank node label string.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    public static void main() {\r\n        String input = \"_:x <x:p> <x:o> .\";\r\n        Graph graph = RDFParser.fromString(input, Lang.NT).toGraph();\r\n        AWriter out = IO.wrapUTF8(System.out);\r\n        NodeFormatter fmt = new NodeFormatterNT() {\r\n            @Override\r\n            public void formatBNode(AWriter w, String label) {\r\n                w.print(\"_:\");\r\n                String lab = NodeFmtLib.encodeBNodeLabel(label);\r\n                w.print(lab);\r\n            }\r\n        };\r\n        StreamRDF stream = new WriterStreamRDFPlain(out, fmt) ;\r\n        StreamRDFOps.graphToStream(graph, stream);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nHope that helps","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/2184051105/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/2185172583","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/2501#issuecomment-2185172583","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/2501","id":2185172583,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec6CPxZn","user":{"login":"hartig","id":584467,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NDQ2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/584467?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hartig","html_url":"https://github.com/hartig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hartig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hartig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hartig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hartig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hartig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hartig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hartig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hartig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hartig/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-23T17:19:59Z","updated_at":"2024-06-23T17:19:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@afs apologies for the delay; after I came back from traveling, my university responsibilities required all my time.\r\n\r\n> I haven't managed to do a clean \"git rebase\" against the current `main` (which is the \"rebase and merge\" github option) which isn't that surprising. The rebased current PR seem to have conflicts all seem to be not between main and the PR but within the PR's history - which I can't explain.\r\n\r\nThe reason might be that some of the commits within the PR may be conflicting with one another. Right before creating the PR, I already rebased to the then-latest `main` and realized that some parts of the internal API of Jena had changed quite a bit (e.g., `LiteralLabel` is a final class now but was an interface in the version that I forked and extended), which meant that I had to change parts of my implementation.\r\n\r\n> When we're ready to merge, simply take diff of the current the PR (the URL is https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/2501.diff), start a new branch in your repo `git apply the patch` and make a new PR - single commit, with you as author.\r\n\r\nPerfect.\r\n\r\n> Performance:\r\n>\r\n> There is one place that needs investigation that I have found so far which is the mixes this - `CDTAwareParserProfile` is on the critical path for all parsing whether CDT's are used or not.\r\n>\r\n> The subclass quickly tests whether to invoke the superclass but parsing is sensitive to the JIT ptimizer. Parsing runs at about one/two microseconds per triple which isn't that many instructions and the new may\r\nchange what optimizations the JIT performs.\r\n>\r\n> It may well make no measurable difference because the optimizer nowadays has ways to implement virtual method calls as direct function calls. The only way to find out is to try.\r\n\r\nWould it be an option to move the code of `CDTAwareParserProfile` into `ParserProfileStd` and, then, remove `CDTAwareParserProfile` altogether?\r\n\r\nAnother option may be to enable users to switch off support for CDT literals (e.g., via an argument in `ModLangParse`, similar to `--strict`). If switched off, `RiotLib` would create a `ParserProfileStd` instance instead of a `CDTAwareParserProfile` instance.\r\n\r\nYet another option may also be to combine both of these ideas. What do you think?\r\n\r\n> Functionality:\r\n>\r\n> [...] Jena needs a way to test teh functionality it ships and it does that by running test suites every build. [...]\r\n>\r\n> For the stability, PRs needs tests and there aren't any in this PR. I see that there are [AWSlabs SPARQL-CDTs manifest-driven tests](https://github.com/awslabs/SPARQL-CDTs/tree/main/tests) (Apache Licensed). One possibility is adding the current state of them to the PR (if they pass). To be clear -- it's a copy, nothing more; AWSlabs retains the defining material and manages its evolution. [...]\r\n\r\nOf course. I can copy these tests.\r\n\r\nI assume they would go into a new subdirectory under `./jena-arq/testing/`, right?\r\n\r\nAfter I have created the copy, where do I have to add a pointer to them such that they are run automatically during a build?\r\n\r\nCurrently, I run these tests manually using `arq.rdftests`. They all pass, except for four tests.\r\n\r\nThese four tests are [list-functions/sameterm-03.rq](https://github.com/awslabs/SPARQL-CDTs/blob/main/tests/list-functions/sameterm-03.rq), [list-functions/sameterm-04.rq](https://github.com/awslabs/SPARQL-CDTs/blob/main/tests/list-functions/sameterm-04.rq), [map-functions/sameterm-03.rq](https://github.com/awslabs/SPARQL-CDTs/blob/main/tests/map-functions/sameterm-03.rq), and [map-functions/sameterm-04.rq](https://github.com/awslabs/SPARQL-CDTs/blob/main/tests/map-functions/sameterm-04.rq). All of them check the behavior of `SAMETERM`. They did pass in my original implementation, but after I had to reimplement some things because the internal API of Jena had changed  (the aforementioned change of `LiteralLabel`, in particular), they fail. I think it would be possible to make them pass again, but that would require adding a new constructor to `LiteralLabel`---namely, a constructor via which it is possible to provide both the lexical form and the value. Let me know if you want me to push a corresponding commit to this PR in order to demonstrate what exactly I mean, and if you don't like it, I can revert this commit. Alternatively, I may simply comment out the four failing tests for now.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/2185172583/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/2187128684","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/2536#issuecomment-2187128684","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/2536","id":2187128684,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec6CXO9s","user":{"login":"arne-bdt","id":53625519,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjI1NTE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53625519?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arne-bdt","html_url":"https://github.com/arne-bdt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arne-bdt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arne-bdt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arne-bdt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arne-bdt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arne-bdt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arne-bdt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arne-bdt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arne-bdt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arne-bdt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-24T18:06:42Z","updated_at":"2024-06-24T18:06:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This

The PR introduces a slight overhead for checking the operand types but I'd say this is outweighed by the overall performance improvement for queries that inline data using VALUE blocks.\r\n\r\nAs a further improvement for this PR, instead of adding the logic to detect table-operands to JoinClassifier, it could also be moved to [TransformJoinStrategy](https://github.com/apache/jena/blob/f666547086d4a474ef62a07e8d1a4a2b336022fa/jena-arq/src/main/java/org/apache/jena/sparql/algebra/optimize/TransformJoinStrategy.java#L39) - In that case, only if the original JoinClassifier returned \"linear join\" then an extra check for table operands would be made that could change the verdict to \"hash join\".\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/2188547766/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/2199391302","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/issues/2555#issuecomment-2199391302","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/2555","id":2199391302,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec6DGAxG","user":{"login":"namedgraph","id":849526,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0OTUyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/849526?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/namedgraph","html_url":"https://github.com/namedgraph","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namedgraph/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namedgraph/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namedgraph/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namedgraph/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namedgraph/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namedgraph/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namedgraph/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namedgraph/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namedgraph/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-01T07:03:21Z","updated_at":"2024-07-01T08:59:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I tried this\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl --url-query 'query=SELECT DISTINCT * WHERE { <http://dbpedia.org/resource/OpenLink_Software> ?p ?o } LIMIT 100' 'http://dbpedia.org/sparql' -L | grep langString\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich gives\r\n\r\n```\r\n   <binding name=\"o\"><literal datatype=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#langString\">~50</literal></binding>\r\n```\r\n\r\nLooks suspect since the `rdf:langString` datatype is normally implied by\r\n`@xml:lang`.\r\n\r\nOn Mon, Jul 1, 2024 at 8:38 AM averza ***@***.***> wrote:\r\n\r\n> Version\r\n>\r\n> 5.0.0\r\n> What happened?\r\n>\r\n> I am running a query on the dbpedia.org SPARQL endpoint.

It is internal.\r\n* `Quad.defaultGraphIRI` is the contract name of the default graph for applications.\r\n* `Quad.defaultGraphNodeGenerated` is an internal name (but not parsers) where a quad is for the default graph.\r\n\r\nThe last two are covered by `Quad.isDefaultGraph(node)`. They are different (external/.internal) although only slightly so maybe it wasn't necessary to split the concepts.\r\n\r\nThe other cases need tracking down and checking.\r\n\r\nThe deserialized `Quad.defaultGraphIRI` is consequence of `DatasetGraph.find`, not the serialization/deserialization.
