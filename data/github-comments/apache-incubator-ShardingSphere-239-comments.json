I need to reproduce this exception.\r\n\r\nThat's our project code. It may take a while to make a demo. I will upload a demo later. I avoided this problem by canceling the security check, but found a new problem. When inserting data into a data table that is not configured with a table-sharing strategy, this error 'Cannot find strategy for generate keys.' occurred. After debugging, I found that the key generation strategy only has two tables I configured. How can I solve it?\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46279672/135007370-21bc5a98-989c-4a84-81b5-8bfc3f603d81.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46279672/135007808-afa9c8cb-7efb-4f88-b20e-2e11abbd336c.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/928575325/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/928600926","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/11236#issuecomment-928600926","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/11236","id":928600926,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAvkN_M43WVNe","user":{"login":"sandynz","id":42492540,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNDkyNTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42492540?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandynz","html_url":"https://github.com/sandynz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandynz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandynz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandynz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandynz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandynz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandynz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandynz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandynz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandynz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-28T01:51:25Z","updated_at":"2021-09-28T01:51:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@justbk2015 feedback it works.
