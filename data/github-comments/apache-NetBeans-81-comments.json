While it is desirable that e.g. Project is not reloaded again needlesly, or that is not marked as \"having problems\" then display an empty problem window (yes, happens, but I delayed investigation until after e.g. #2747 happens since it may change a lot) - this action allows external control of when the \"priming\" happens. IMHO there will be always a concept of 'first build'  in Gradle as it is there in Maven (or would be in Ivy), at least download necessary binary depdencies. Withoutt that step, many IDE functions are practically useless. This is a separate (reduced) action in Maven, distinct from Build and I believe it's may be special in Gradle too.\r\n\r\nHaving a separate action allows an external module, like LSP to change the workflow. In this case, our LSP client user base has different workflow habits, so we are trying to satisfy them. Using this action, LSP users can be happy (priming build can initiated e.g. when a project loads) and NetBeans users can be happy too (nothing is changed). With a possibility to add Project UI core setting \"Run priming build after open\".","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/803270155/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/803400671","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2744#issuecomment-803400671","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/2744","id":803400671,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwMzQwMDY3MQ==","user":{"login":"lkishalmi","id":1381701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODE3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1381701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi","html_url":"https://github.com/lkishalmi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-20T16:34:31Z","updated_at":"2021-03-20T16:34:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"A

This is not a problem in NetBeans IDE as each project can provide its own UI and communicate such internalities with the user on its own. However, when dealing with the projects only through general API of `org.netbeans.api.Project` or `org.netbeans.api.java.Source` there are certain limitations (revealed with with our work on VSNetBeans) that stand in the way. The `COMMAND_PRIME` is our attempt to fix one of such limitations.\r\n\r\n> ...there will be always a concept of 'first build' in Gradle as it is there in Maven (or would be in Ivy), at least download necessary \r\n> binary dependencies. Without that step, many IDE functions are practically useless. \r\n\r\nRight. The Java Source support needs all the binaries on disk to work. This has been identified even before the Apache transition and externalized (made visible) via [ClassPath.Flag.INCOMPLETE](https://bits.netbeans.org/12.0/javadoc/org-netbeans-api-java-classpath/org/netbeans/api/java/classpath/ClassPath.Flag.html#INCOMPLETE) as introduced by @tzezula. Projects are supposed to communicate to Java Source that the state of the project isn't complete and it makes little sense to analyze it.\r\n\r\n> This is a separate (reduced) action in Maven, distinct from Build and I believe it's may be special in Gradle too.\r\n\r\nWhat can a UI do when the `ClassPath` is incomplete? It can start a build as we did in 12.2 - however it turns out that `COMMAND_BUILD` is too heavyweight - it also runs tests which may fail by itself. We need to trigger more lightweight action. As such Sváťa exposed (already existing Maven concept) of priming build as an action in #2795. Making this action work in Gradle is a natural step.\r\n\r\n> With a possibility to add Project UI core setting \"Run priming build after open\".\r\n\r\nI believe that by adding a _trust and prime_ checkbox to following dialog\r\n\r\n![obrazek](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26887752/111897079-1de30000-8a1e-11eb-9fcf-48aa4614880d.png)\r\n\r\nwe may naturally address various security concerns raised by @emilianbold & others.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/803524899/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/803530137","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2822#issuecomment-803530137","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/2822","id":803530137,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwMzUzMDEzNw==","user":{"login":"sdedic","id":26788611,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg4NjEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26788611?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic","html_url":"https://github.com/sdedic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-21T08:13:02Z","updated_at":"2021-03-21T08:13:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Could you include some narrative explanation tooltip on that checkbox ?

However Cloud PaaS platforms (I suspect that GitHub Actions use some Azure PaaS wodoo) are known to use _serverless_ as part of their infra, for example an outbound FW may be based on Azure Functions and thus have a cold start penalty. Now, to make matters worse, this infra may be shared between ephemeral environments, so one run may experience the problem while another doesn't. It will seem random. Just speculation, though. \r\n\r\nFor me the problem has escalated over the past 1-2 months, before that it was a very, very rare occurrence. So something may have changed on the GitHub side, dunno. There are quite a few people reporting something similar in the GitHub issue tracker. \r\n\r\nIt is also worth mentioning why the existing NetBeans GitHub Actions jobs do not - to my knowledge - experience a problem in this respect: they use the GitHub Actions **cache** component. As long as this cache has been build successfully once, no downloads will be attempted by the Ant script (the `DownloadBinaries` task will see the artifact is already there on disk). The cache will be re-used forever, it is used at least every 7 days and will therefore never fall victim to GitHub's delete strategy. There's no problem per-se that the build jobs use this cache, as long as external artifact versions are immutable. But pray we do not have to re-build it.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/804326243/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/804339832","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2826#issuecomment-804339832","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/2826","id":804339832,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwNDMzOTgzMg==","user":{"login":"lbruun","id":32431476,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDMxNDc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32431476?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbruun","html_url":"https://github.com/lbruun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbruun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbruun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbruun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbruun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbruun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbruun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbruun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbruun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbruun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-22T19:35:37Z","updated_at":"2021-03-22T19:35:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> If this _is_ the cause of the various CI errors we get with downloading, what's the downside of making the default much longer (eg. 30s)?
