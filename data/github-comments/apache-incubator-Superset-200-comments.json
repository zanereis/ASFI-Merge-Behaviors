@dorq Thanks for the proposal, I like it. Here is my input from engineering point of view:\r\n\r\n- `We add Sort and Filter capabilities at the top of this list (sticky at top of panel).` \r\nCurrent dashboard editor had sort and filter capabilities for the chart lists, right? is there any difference from current feature?\r\n\r\n- I noticed there is a preview in the chart list, which is not available in the current dashboard. We didn't implement it mostly from performance concerns. When a user opens edit mode, the chart list shows all the charts that owned by the user, for airbnb users it may have a few hundred items, and each chart is a query (sometimes may be cached data) to backend. To make the list show up and ready to interactive with user need a lot of intelligence, for example, when to send query, send how many queries, how to handle user scrolling in the chart list, etc.  Otherwise user will get stuck waiting for query running and chart render, and the editing dashboard could become unacceptable slow.  \r\n\r\nIf you decided to implement this chart preview, please offer a choice to enable/disable it, and `disabled` should be default state, so that user won't get stuck when we release the new version. If user really want to see chart preview, they can manually enable it. \r\n\r\n- For the same reason (loading chart list might be time consuming), the old design separated new dashboard component list from chart list. When user entered into edit mode, they see dashboard component list first, then click -> to see chart list. So that when user just wants to re-organize charts layout, resize chart, remove chart, edit title, etc, they don't have to wait for chart list loading. Could this also be considered in the new design?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/471408379/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/471410832","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/7001#issuecomment-471410832","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/7001","id":471410832,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MTQxMDgzMg==","user":{"login":"MarcusSorealheis","id":2353608,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTM2MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2353608?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarcusSorealheis","html_url":"https://github.com/MarcusSorealheis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarcusSorealheis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarcusSorealheis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarcusSorealheis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarcusSorealheis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarcusSorealheis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarcusSorealheis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarcusSorealheis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarcusSorealheis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarcusSorealheis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-11T05:41:01Z","updated_at":"2019-03-11T05:41:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I actually encountered this bug when I was fixing a different bug and was too lazy to fix it.

A few questions:\r\n> \r\n> * Can you post the current font sizes - for both Big Number and Subheader - along with the new options?\r\n> * Is `Normal` the same as the default size we currently have?\r\n> * Can you share a screenshot of the Subheader at the largest size?\r\n\r\n- I could but I think they might add confusion. Font sizes (at the moment) for big number are dynamically created. As you resize your screen or chart, the font sizes will adjust. Thus font sizes will change every time the user views them through the dropdown.\r\n- Normal is the default for Big Number with Trendline. It is slightly smaller than the default for Big Number Total. The font sizing was different before my changes. To be able to use the same component, I combined the two in this PR.\r\n<img width=\"1261\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-03-11 at 10 19 06 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47833996/54143526-407dbf80-43e7-11e9-8381-ce89065fe735.png\">\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/471636868/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/471640168","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/6996#issuecomment-471640168","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/6996","id":471640168,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MTY0MDE2OA==","user":{"login":"michellethomas","id":817955,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNzk1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/817955?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas","html_url":"https://github.com/michellethomas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-11T17:28:23Z","updated_at":"2019-03-11T17:28:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi, thanks for creating this design proposal. I recently worked on the datasource control, and have a few comments about that section of the designs. We recently brought back the ability to change datasources from the explore view (https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/6816), it's been an important feature for users and one we'd like to keep around. We also tried to move away from using icons to avoid having a number of icons when there are lot of actions (I don't have a super strong opinion about this but just thought I'd note it).\r\n\r\n@xtinec also had a PR to bring back the + metadata button next to the datasource control (not sure if this is something they still need to keep https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/6911).\r\n\r\nWe also have some pretty long table names, so something short like `def.fact_dags` fits into the space between \"Select datasource\" and the icons, but many of our datasource names are longer and showing more of the table name is important. I can get more specific about this if it's helpful.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/471640168/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/471649492","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/7006#issuecomment-471649492","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/7006","id":471649492,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MTY0OTQ5Mg==","user":{"login":"elukey","id":1536240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzYyNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1536240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elukey","html_url":"https://github.com/elukey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elukey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elukey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elukey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elukey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elukey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elukey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elukey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elukey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elukey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-11T17:51:34Z","updated_at":"2019-03-12T08:38:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The following change (live hacked on the host) works fine for all our wold map graphs:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndiff --git a/superset/viz.py b/superset/viz.py\r\nindex 068a70dc..f24f063f 100644\r\n--- a/superset/viz.py\r\n+++ b/superset/viz.py\r\n@@ -1742,7 +1742,7 @@ class WorldMapViz(BaseViz):\r\n             ndf = df[cols]\r\n             # df[metric] will be a DataFrame\r\n             # because there are duplicate column names\r\n-            ndf['m1'] = df[metric].iloc[:, 0]\r\n+            ndf['m1'] = df[metric]\r\n             ndf['m2'] = ndf['m1']\r\n         else:\r\n             if secondary_metric:\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/471649492/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/471651641","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/6997#issuecomment-471651641","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/6997","id":471651641,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MTY1MTY0MQ==","user":{"login":"dorq","id":2992086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTIwODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2992086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dorq","html_url":"https://github.com/dorq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dorq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dorq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dorq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dorq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dorq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dorq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dorq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dorq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dorq/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-11T17:56:41Z","updated_at":"2019-03-11T17:56:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> Current dashboard editor had sort and filter capabilities for the chart lists, right? is there any difference from current feature?\r\n\r\nYou're exactly right.

the \"Select datasource\" section is expanded\r\n- keep the same dropdown options you implemented\r\n- remove the icons from the section header that I proposed above; these actions are redundant with the dropdown options\r\n- for long names, we allow them to wrap to a second line if needed (making the header for the section a bit taller in those
