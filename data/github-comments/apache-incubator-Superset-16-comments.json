This kind of migration is not supported in sqlite because the constraint as no name. Otherwise, I would have submitted it immediately. That's why I'm asking for the best approach.\n\nThere's a point to be made, though. Foreign keys are not on by default on sqlite, that's probably why none noticed the bug before. Could we modify the init migrations to have the correct foreign key and we conditionally skip the migration for sqlite? I don't like the idea because it will introduce an unpredictable behavior.
