show other sql queries scenarios for `EnumerableLimitSort` (nulls last, order on several columns, limit without offset, ...); the `HrSchemaBig` that I used on the bug test should be enough to provide all these scenarios.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/1567926855/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/1568013580","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/3232#issuecomment-1568013580","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/3232","id":1568013580,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAUNjNM5ddf0M","user":{"login":"sonarqubecloud[bot]","id":39514782,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mzk1MTQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/12526?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/sonarqubecloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-30T08:41:20Z","updated_at":"2023-05-30T08:41:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Kudos,
