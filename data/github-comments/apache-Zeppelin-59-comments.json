If you want to use pyspark/~~scala~~ spark-sql/ blah - use the spark interpreter. \nWe'll only support additional langs as Mahout introduces interpreters for them. eg. right now only Spark-scala, coming soon, flink-spark, I'm not sure the time tables on H20-Mahout interpreter. \n\neg. Mahout introduces its own Iloop for the spark-mahout comand line shell, we'll leverage that.\n\nThen we're going to use the Resource pool to move tables from Mahout to R/Python for plotting. you can stringify a tsv put it in the resourcepool, fish it out in python or R then make a dataframe out of it and plot it. Since its only for plotting, there is a natural limit on how big it should be in the first place. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/223728514/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/223728944","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/951#issuecomment-223728944","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/951","id":223728944,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMzcyODk0NA==","user":{"login":"Leemoonsoo","id":1540981,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDA5ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1540981?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo","html_url":"https://github.com/Leemoonsoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-04T01:41:07Z","updated_at":"2016-06-04T01:41:07Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Cool.
