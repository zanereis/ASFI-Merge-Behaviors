There are no tests ensuring that this functionality is preserved in future development. I propose to implement a single sanity integration test that Zipkin loads and that most common links work under a different path.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/328827730/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/329070696","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/1732#issuecomment-329070696","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1732","id":329070696,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyOTA3MDY5Ng==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-13T06:21:31Z","updated_at":"2017-09-13T06:21:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"cc

Easier than having to do a migration of this to v2 later\r\n\r\nWe have not migrated to V2 yet. Our datastore is in V1 format, so we have to read via V1 api. For writing to permanent store, either V1 or V2 is fine. Looks like zipkin server writes in V2 format even if we call V1 api, which seems a bit strange.\r\nIdeally we should be able to run the server in V1 mode or V2 mode, and all APIs can then work accordingly. Do we have a config property that can do this?\r\n\r\n>interesting.. I was thinking this was going to happen in javascript. maybe it should? that way it doesn't need to expose a new server-side endpoint.\r\n\r\nI wanted to keep the client light. Also, if its on the server side, other clients/scripts can also use it. We can move it to javascript if needed.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/332980516/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/333010745","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/1747#issuecomment-333010745","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1747","id":333010745,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMzAxMDc0NQ==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-29T01:59:55Z","updated_at":"2017-09-29T01:59:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I don't want to make an api like this as a part of the server api, especially not under v1 namespace. it doesn't impact the UI to do the blocking here or there.\r\n\r\nIn order to deploy this UI change, you will inherit the v2 api anyway, unless you are somehow hosting static assets independently.. is that the case?
