In the TensorFlow model (disjoint graph support) it is still up to the user to bucket their data and pad each segment to the closest bucket. So one minibatch would contain all segments of length 11-25, padded to be exactly 25. In most applications I can think of, this is fine.\n\n> The whole network has to have the same recurrence sequence pattern (e.g. forward sweeping through the input sequence, backward sweeping, etc.). \n\nMost architectures which get state-of-the-art results on various NLP tasks (and not just NLP -- speech recognition, video processing, etc) do not have such a simple pattern. We could design an API which works for certain architectures _now_ (like seq2seq+attention), but who knows what type of architectures will become popular in the near future. The only truly general mechanism is to let the user specify whatever graph they want -- which MxNet already lets you do, but only for a single connected graph.\n\nFor example, consider the _recursive_ neural network architecture where the network is a binary tree. The leaf nodes are the data, and the intermediate nodes all share the same parameters (it could be a fully connected layer or an LSTM-like layer).\n\n```\n     N\n  /    \\\n  N     N\n / \\  /  \\\na   b c  d\n```\n\nIt would be extremely difficult to design an API that allows for variable length sequences here. But the bucketing method would work naturally.\n\nThere are other advantages to the bucketing method (e.g., supporting multiple sub graphs that share parameters), namely, they easily allow for multi-task/multi-modal training. For example, you could train a translation model and a language model jointly and tie certain parameters together. In this case, you would specify two disjoint graphs, and randomly alternate whether the minibatch corresponds to the translation model or the language model. The embedding layer (and possibly other layers) would be tied together.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/177376888/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/177396795","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/1388#issuecomment-177396795","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1388","id":177396795,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3NzM5Njc5NQ==","user":{"login":"piiswrong","id":568948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODk0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong","html_url":"https://github.com/piiswrong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-31T05:08:05Z","updated_at":"2016-01-31T05:08:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"`executor.backward(out_grads=mx.nd.ones((3,

But for most of the operators, we just have one element in the output.\nThis patch does not affect any existing code, it just enables us to set the information when we register the op properties. And the op properties are just static information of the op. I am currently relying on this information to generate the CPP wrappers for the operators. I think it is also used to generated python doc. Fixing this will allow me to get the return type of the SliceChannel operator right, and it should also fix the python doc.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/177828829/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/177850756","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/1392#issuecomment-177850756","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1392","id":177850756,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3Nzg1MDc1Ng==","user":{"login":"hjk41","id":1132769,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzI3Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1132769?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjk41","html_url":"https://github.com/hjk41","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjk41/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjk41/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjk41/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjk41/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjk41/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjk41/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjk41/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjk41/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjk41/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-01T08:39:03Z","updated_at":"2016-02-01T08:39:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Why should we support cuDNN v2?

have a similar question for the case where I'm using MXDataIter objects. I want to load in two different iterators and then route them to different symbolic input nodes. It looks like the NDArrayIter can help here but requires the inputs to be NDArrays, and I don't see how to combine that with MXDataIter objects. Can the PrefetchingIter implementation help here, or maybe this requires writing a custom iterator?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/178753497/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/178757762","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/1358#issuecomment-178757762","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1358","id":178757762,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3ODc1Nzc2Mg==","user":{"login":"Quares","id":7707019,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MDcwMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7707019?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Quares","html_url":"https://github.com/Quares","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Quares/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Quares/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Quares/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Quares/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Quares/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Quares/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Quares/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Quares/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Quares/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-02T18:56:38Z","updated_at":"2016-02-02T18:56:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I have tried with the latest release (20160202) and still no success (had to revert back to the one that is working, i.e., 20151228). The problem starts with as simple command as\n`mx.nd.ones(c(2,3), mx.gpu())`\nwhich returns a matrix full of zeros instead of ones. By the way, the same erroneous behavior occurs with the windows version of python package build.
