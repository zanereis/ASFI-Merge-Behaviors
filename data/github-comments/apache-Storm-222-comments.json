That also caused the \"Non continuous offset found\" show many times in the log,  which will cause no message will be committed to kafka. The only solution will be restart the storm topology.\n\nWe emit message in this way - kafkaSpoutStreams.emit(collector, tuple, msgId); Could you please help confirm - **storm would ensure  all the messages that emitted by the spout will be acked/failed back without exception?** Because if this is not the case, the spout will not be able to find the continuous offset to commit, then we must fix this issue urgently as we plan to release the change early next month.
