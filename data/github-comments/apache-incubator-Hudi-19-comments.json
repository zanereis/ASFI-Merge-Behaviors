The issue HUDI-61 may not be valid anymore since we do not have the payload class dependency in the SpillableMap anymore. \r\n\r\nRight now, any implementation of HoodieRecordPayload can use the SpillableMap and this is not limited to HoodieAvroPayload. \r\n\r\nDo you have any custom implementation of HoodieRecordPayload that you intend to use ? Are you running into any specific issue ? Happy to help out once I know the underlying issue you are facing.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/478698398/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/478699274","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/621#issuecomment-478699274","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/621","id":478699274,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3ODY5OTI3NA==","user":{"login":"n3nash","id":2722167,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MjIxNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2722167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash","html_url":"https://github.com/n3nash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-01T18:49:08Z","updated_at":"2019-04-01T18:49:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Can you please share you understanding of `super.close()` in this context ?

The `Remove payload class dependency in SpillableMap` is a slightly different issue than the one you are trying to propose.\r\n \r\nThat intention of removing payload there is to support spillable map for any type T instead of a HoodieRecordPayload (which was the implementation before). I think I'll close HUDI-61 since it's not valid anymore. \r\n\r\nWhat you are suggesting is valid, we require a way to be able to instantiate the payload without enforcing some sort of constructor although this changes the HoodieRecordPayload interface making it sort of non-backwards compatible if we assume we want to deprecate the constructor way going forward. I've opened this issue : https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-93. \r\n\r\nAlthough, I would suggest you to punt on this change since this requires some discussions and suggest you to take a look at https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/HUDI/issues/HUDI-92?filter=allopenissues is that interests you.
