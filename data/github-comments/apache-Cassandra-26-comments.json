But, to get the expected behavior, `astimezone()` should be called on \"aware\" datetime objects. When you call `astimezone()` on a naive datetime object, it assumes the object to be in the system timezone. The Datastax driver gives out naive UTC datetime objects---`trace.started_at` and `event.datetime` directly come from the CQL queries from [here](https://github.com/datastax/python-driver/blob/master/cassandra/query.py#L1004) and [here](https://github.com/datastax/python-driver/blob/master/cassandra/query.py#L1029).\r\n\r\n> If self is naive, it is presumed to represent time in the system timezone.\r\n\r\nHere's an example that illustrates the problem.
