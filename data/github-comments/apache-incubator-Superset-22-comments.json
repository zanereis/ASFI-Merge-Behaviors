I went through the steps you suggested and they do successfully create the new column in the DB.\n\n**However**, when I then clean everything and run through the migrations from scratch, I get to the same error (stacktrace below). Migration `27ae655e4247` still fails because it's trying to query a field which exists in the model but not in the DB (yet). Those fields don't get added till a few steps later. I think it's still sensible to change that migration to declarative base to avoid this (and any other issues around creating new fields in the future). Thoughts?\n\n```\nINFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Context impl SQLiteImpl.\nINFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Will assume non-transactional DDL.\nINFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Running upgrade

This means in my case returning to the browser in the order of ten million data point for one day. It killed Vertica for few second and crashed my Chrome due to memory pressure (on a beefy Mac).\n- The feature ignores the optimized geospatial indexes and data structure of more modern databases (it is pretty complex to pull this out, though)\n- The feature also doesn't try to perform some pre-aggregation on the server to reduce the traffic to/from caravel.\n\nAs is, I'm going to disable the feature in the 0.10 deployment of Caravel since it is not suitable for production.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/230379647/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/230380405","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/381#issuecomment-230380405","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/381","id":230380405,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMDM4MDQwNQ==","user":{"login":"SalehHindi","id":15721377,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzIxMzc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15721377?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SalehHindi","html_url":"https://github.com/SalehHindi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SalehHindi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SalehHindi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SalehHindi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SalehHindi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SalehHindi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SalehHindi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SalehHindi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SalehHindi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SalehHindi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-05T03:23:59Z","updated_at":"2016-07-05T03:23:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@mistercrunch, any updates on this issue?

It wouldn't be a full \"custom SQL\" solution but it would allow some limited functionality for joining tables. \n\nMy suggestion would be to create a new class as an extension of the current `SqlaTable` called something like `CompositeSqlaTable`. This would start with a base table (e.g. `customers`) and allow the joining of other tables to it (e.g. `orders`) with a choice of join options (left/right/inner/outer) and explicit specification of which field to use for joining on the left and right. The created composite table would then function and be queriable like a normal table at the moment in caravel (I guess it might be most sensible to autodetect columns from both sides of the join).\n\n@mistercrunch thoughts on implementation/general idea? I know you mentioned a while back that you might be interested in limited join functionality.\n\n@kartha01 @lerrua would this solve some of your pain points?\n\nThis would be massively helpful for me beyond using views, especially where the relevant datetime column for filtering is in a different table to the entity which I'm trying to query.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/230532944/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/230552034","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/718#issuecomment-230552034","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/718","id":230552034,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMDU1MjAzNA==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-05T17:52:44Z","updated_at":"2016-07-05T17:52:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/builds/6875675/badge)](https://coveralls.io/builds/6875675)\n\nCoverage increased (+0.02%) to 81.059% when pulling **17d56b5a11152b0e8168bf3c240033327aa65558 on alanmcruickshank:autorefresh-dashboard-2** into **8135c240dc178014f03c943ba1b9beab26716325 on airbnb:master**.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/230552034/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/230574306","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/665#issuecomment-230574306","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/665","id":230574306,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMDU3NDMwNg==","user":{"login":"danield9tqh","id":4173815,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzM4MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4173815?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danield9tqh","html_url":"https://github.com/danield9tqh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danield9tqh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danield9tqh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danield9tqh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danield9tqh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danield9tqh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danield9tqh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danield9tqh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danield9tqh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danield9tqh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-05T19:14:28Z","updated_at":"2016-07-05T19:15:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I think being able to filter the entire dashboard by time interval would be very helpful.
