The main problem is that we don't know what spec IDs are affected by a scan until we plan files. I think the following would work.\r\n\r\n```\r\n- Call planFiles, materialize the iterable of files to be scanned and store the files in a list.\r\n- While materializing the iterable, keep track of all seen spec IDs.\r\n- Build an intersection of all partition types for the specs covered by this scan (we know spec IDs from the previous step).\r\n    - This intersection is a set of partition columns which we can guarantee the data is clustered by. That’s why they should be our keys in KeyGroupedPartitioning.\r\n- Determine what partition columns from the intersection of all partition types can’t be combined (using the source columns provided by the user).\r\n- Create a projection that would select values for non-combinable partition columns from a file partition tuple.\r\n- Build a map where keys are tuples with projected non-combinable partition columns and values are lists of files.\r\n- Sort each file list by spec ID and partition so that we combine splits for the same partition.\r\n- Call bin-packing code on each list of files independently.\r\n- Union the result.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat do you think, @sunchao @rdblue?

Seems the primiary key can't be derived from the iceberg's HiveCatalog even though you have defined it using Hive Cli .\r\n> \r\n> 1. you can define with the following using Flink SQL\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> CREATE TABLE ods_data_1_1 (\r\n>     xxx,\r\n>     xxx,\r\n>     PRIMARY KEY(`id`) NOT ENFORCED\r\n> ) WITH (\r\n>     'connector'='iceberg',\r\n>     'catalog-name'='hive_prod',\r\n>     'catalog-database'='default',\r\n>     'catalog-table'='ods_data_1_1',\r\n>     'uri'='hdfs://nn-1:8020/user/hive/warehouse/',\r\n>     'warehouse'='hdfs://nn:8020/path/to/warehouse'\r\n> );\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> Note: it won't create a table, it's just a mapping to the table crated before in Hive. Refer the [flink-connector](https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/latest/flink-connector/) for more details. Then write the data using the sql normally.\r\n> \r\n> 2. You can use Flink DDL to create the table, the Hive should have the ability to read the table.  Have you ever followed the document [enable Iceberg support](https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/latest/hive/#enabling-iceberg-support-in-hive)?\r\n\r\nOk, so far I have solved this problem. When I created the Iceberg table (Hive Ctatlog) in the Flink SQL Client, I lost the parameters. After carefully reviewing the Iceberg and Flink documents and trying many times, Upsert can be implemented. Thanks to every helper!\r\n\r\n### The correct steps are as follows:\r\n1. create catalog\r\n```\r\nCREATE CATALOG hive_iceberg\r\nWITH (\r\n    'clients'='5',\r\n    'type'='iceberg',\r\n    'catalog-type'='hive',\r\n    'property-version'='1',\r\n    'uri'='thrift://xxxx:9083',\r\n    'warehouse'='hdfs://xxxx/user/hive/warehouse/'\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. create db\r\n```\r\nCREATE DATABASE ods;\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. create table\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS hive_iceberg.ods.table(\r\nid BIGINT,\r\n...\r\nPRIMARY KEY (id) NOT ENFORCED\r\n)\r\nWITH (\r\n    'format-version'='2',\r\n    'iceberg.mr.catalog'='hive',\r\n    'engine.hive.enabled'='true',\r\n    'write.upsert.enabled'='true',\r\n    'write.metadata.previous-versions-max'='3',\r\n    'hive.vectorized.execution.enabled'='false',\r\n    'write.metadata.delete-after-commit.enabled'='true',\r\n    'warehouse'='hdfs://xxxx/user/hive/warehouse/ods/table'\r\n)\r\n;\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1296575962/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1296683305","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/5846#issuecomment-1296683305","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/5846","id":1296683305,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85NSdEp","user":{"login":"luoyuxia","id":20389154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzg5MTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20389154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia","html_url":"https://github.com/luoyuxia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-31T07:14:14Z","updated_at":"2022-10-31T07:14:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Any failover happen?
