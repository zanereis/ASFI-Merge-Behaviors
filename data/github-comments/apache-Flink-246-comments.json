Exceptions signal an exceptional situation and should not occur in the happy case.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I'm a bit hesitant to introduce this special `normal-life-cycle-exception` because they should not exist in the first place since it is the normal life cycle. Instead, I think we should log the exception (if they occur) where they are thrown and send a `String reason` which can be logged on the remote component. That way we should get rid of most of the exceptions being printed on `DEBUG`.\r\n\r\nAs a first step to get there, I think it would be enough to simply print the exception message in the log statement. That way we would get rid of the stack traces and don't have to introduce a special exception type. As a second step, we can refactor the RPC interfaces which have the `Exception cause` parameters. What do you think?\r\n\r\nFLINK-9277 is related but not directly the same. The scope of this issue is to decrease the redundant messages which occur when releasing a shared slot starting from the leafs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/388771721/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/388772310","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/5995#issuecomment-388772310","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/5995","id":388772310,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4ODc3MjMxMA==","user":{"login":"dawidwys","id":6242259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNDIyNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6242259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys","html_url":"https://github.com/dawidwys","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-14T10:34:40Z","updated_at":"2018-05-14T10:34:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Right sorry for that.

This means that it hard(I'm not sure whether it's possible) to support the `WriteModel.OVERWRITE` for `createAtomically()` with `schema='hdfs'`, if we work-around this by firstly rename the existing file to a tmp file and then rename the pre-commit file to the target file, then this two step operations is not atomic, which may lead to a inconsistent result if the JVM crashes between this operations. I'm running out of myself on this now...Do you have any suggestions for the `createAtomically()` when `schema='hdfs'` and `writeMode='WriteMode.OVERWRITE'`? Can we simply make createAtomically() to not support `WriteMode.OVERWRITE`? @StephanEwen ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/389077315/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/389080478","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6008#issuecomment-389080478","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6008","id":389080478,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4OTA4MDQ3OA==","user":{"login":"tzulitai","id":5284370,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODQzNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5284370?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai","html_url":"https://github.com/tzulitai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-15T08:06:01Z","updated_at":"2018-05-16T05:32:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"~+1 LGTM~","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/389080478/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/389081862","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/5985#issuecomment-389081862","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/5985","id":389081862,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4OTA4MTg2Mg==","user":{"login":"andrew-half","id":23097344,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDk3MzQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23097344?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrew-half","html_url":"https://github.com/andrew-half","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrew-half/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrew-half/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrew-half/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrew-half/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrew-half/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrew-half/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrew-half/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrew-half/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrew-half/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-15T08:11:17Z","updated_at":"2018-05-15T08:38:10Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@walterddr @zentol Thank you guys for a  substantial code-review.

That will not magically make anything better. The whole point is to go from a method that may sneakily throw undeclared exceptions, to a method that declares exceptions.\r\n\r\nAll places that do not require a change to the try/catch statement (add `InvokationTargetException`) have reasonable exception handling in place already, and are not vulnerable to the motivating issue.\r\n\r\nIn fact, for now this makes thing worse because Exceptions get wrapped into `InvokationTargetException`, with the root cause in the `getTargetException()`, not in the exception chain.  That would actually be a serious regression.\r\n\r\nAs a more general comment: Copy/replace style pull requests are a bit tricky, in my opinion - they are rather easy to create (bulk fix tool) and require committers to put up significant time to dig into the matter and to double check that it actually does not cause a regression in the individual spots that are changed. One can probably keep all committers busy for a year with just such fixes without really changing anything for users for the better, and having a high risk of regressions.\r\n\r\nI would personally vote to not have many of those pull requests, or clearly label them as \"cosmetic\" and give them a very low priority in reviewing. Especially given that we have a decent backlog of pull requests for changes that where users will see a difference.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/389170632/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/389185903","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6012#issuecomment-389185903","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6012","id":389185903,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4OTE4NTkwMw==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-15T14:24:33Z","updated_at":"2018-05-15T14:24:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Fix

point about the renaming on `close()` in case close is called for cleanup, rather than success.\r\n\r\nWe could follow the same semantics as in [CheckpointStateOutputStream](https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/master/flink-runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/runtime/state/CheckpointStreamFactory.java#L61)\r\n\r\nThere the semantics are:\r\n  - `close()` means \"close on error / cleanup\" and closes the stream and deletes the temp file.\r\n  - `closeAndPublish()` would mean \"close on success\" and close the stream and rename the file.\r\n  - After `closeAndPublish()` has been called, `close()` becomes a no-op.\r\n\r\nThe [FsCheckpointMetadataOutputStream](https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/master/flink-runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/runtime/state/filesystem/FsCheckpointMetadataOutputStream.java) implements that pattern, I think it worked well and is easy to

were a number of bugs and painful parts in the code, and unfortunately I'm not really sure whether they are major blockers or easily fixable. It surely wouldn't be an 1-2 day work, but some weeks might be realistic.\r\n\r\nAs an example from just off the top of my head, we choke in situations where the POJO has a generic argument T, and a field of type T, and we tell Flink with a `.returns` about the generic argument.\r\n\r\nThere were some other random test failures in older tests, which would require some debugging.\r\n\r\nI think we also have the problem that we don't correctly clean up the old generated classes, so they cause a memory leak across Flink jobs.\r\n\r\nAnother potential issue is that since this PR, there was a new mechanism added to the Flink serializers for dealing with compatibility of serializers (e.g., to ensure that savepoints work across Flink versions), and I'm not sure whether it would be straightforward to update this PR for this. (For example, `PojoSerializer.ensureCompatibility` did not exist back then, and it looks a bit scary at first glance.)\r\n\r\nOne of the pain points was shipping generated code from the driver program to the TMs. The problem is that if you simply serialize an instance of a generated class in the driver (for shipping the job to the cluster), the TM cannot just simply deserialize it, since the generated class does not exist in that JVM. The good news here is that since this PR I accidentally stumbled upon a new solution to this (using `writeReplace` and `readResolve`), which would be nicer than the current solution of this PR.\r\n\r\nNote that there is also this PR for similar code generation for the sorters:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3511\r\nThis has a lot of similarities, but less pain points, because the sorters are better isolated from the other parts of Flink than the serializers, and also because there we don't have to ship generated code from the driver to the TMs (because the sorters are created on the TMs). So I think if we wanted to push this serializer codegen PR, then first we should start with the sorter codegen PR instead, because it is the easier one of the two. I think that one is actually quite close to being mergable. (Note, that I think we solved the \"cleanup between Flink jobs\" issue in that PR, and that solution could be adapted to this PR.)\r\n\r\nBtw. we are in the planning phase of an MSc thesis with (@mukrram-bajwa), whose work might subsume both of these PRs. The idea is to use Graal to do many of the specializations that are in these PRs (and more). The nice thing would be that the modifications to Flink's code would be much less compared to these PRs, as the magic would happen mostly inside a Graal compilation plugin as custom optimization passes.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nGábor","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/389240577/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/389268298","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/5995#issuecomment-389268298","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/5995","id":389268298,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4OTI2ODI5OA==","user":{"login":"dawidwys","id":6242259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNDIyNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6242259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys","html_url":"https://github.com/dawidwys","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-15T18:31:51Z","updated_at":"2018-05-15T18:31:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"As for the snapshot binary data, I do understand that it should be created with appropriate flink version (in this case in theory with flink 1.3) and I've tried really hard to do so until I found out that this test is incompatible with 1.3 and the data could not be generated with flink 1.3 Later found out the comment to the test class that also states so: \r\n\r\n> <p><b>Important:</b> Since Avro itself broke class compatibility between 1.7.7 (used in Flink 1.3) \r\n\r\n> * and 1.8.2 (used in Flink 1.4), the Avro by Pojo compatibility is broken through Avro already.\r\n> * This test only tests that the Avro serializer change (switching from Pojo to Avro for Avro types)\r\n> * works properly.\r\n\r\nAlso the commented code does not compile with flink 1.3(but this is a minor thing)\r\n\r\nData serialized with version of avro used in flink 1.3 (1.7.7) is not binary compatible with avro 1.8.2 (in flink 1.4+), due to changes how SpecificFixed is constructed.\r\n\r\nTherefore how I regenerated this snapshot data is that I run the commented code on current branch.

I think timers should just be considered as keyed state and eventually become part of the keyed state backend's snapshot.\r\n\r\n@makeyang with the above comment, that essentially means that with the work on the RocksDB timer service we are planning to have a larger rewrite of how snapshotting for timer works anyways. I have also concrete plans and ongoing work for doing this for the heap timer service, as well as including a efficient way to delete timers in the heap timer service. All this unfortunately does not match too well with this PR. I suggest that this can be closed because we will address this issue for the next release in a somewhat more holistic way.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/389503394/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/389504019","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6019#issuecomment-389504019","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6019","id":389504019,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4OTUwNDAxOQ==","user":{"login":"sihuazhou","id":7480427,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0ODA0Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7480427?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou","html_url":"https://github.com/sihuazhou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-16T12:40:57Z","updated_at":"2018-05-16T12:40:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@StefanRRichter I definitely agree with your point!

I had a look at the implementation of the iterators in RocksDB, I found the `status()` just return the flag filed `_status` as the result without any complex computation, But for some `composite
