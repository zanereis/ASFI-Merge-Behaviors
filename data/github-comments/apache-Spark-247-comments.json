see the case branch in (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1313/files#diff-bad3987c83bd22d46416d3dd9d208e76L440), when the level returns no task, we tried to call NO_PREF\n\nI think the code seems more complicate than you thought for several reasons\n1. we should call NO_PREF only after the level returns no task, otherwise, we will over-complicate the logic here, e.g. we have two PROCESS_LOCAL tasks, if we call NO_PREF after the first successful launch, then it's actually running the second PROCESS_LOCAL\n2. when we call resourceOffer with NO_PREF, we should not allow the preferredLocality to be modified due to the delay scheduling, so I added a parameter allowAdjustPrefLocality: Boolean\n3. we should avoid some duplicate traversing on the pendingTask list, e.g.\n\nwhen you failed to find a task on PROCESS_LOCAL, you call resourceOffer with NOPREF again, you should not search the task list for PROCESS_LOCAL again, instead, we just skip that level\n1. we should ensure NODE_LOCAL always be scheduled before NOPREF, it's achieved by making NOPREF \"farther\" than NODE_LOCAL....\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50260912/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50262166","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1524#issuecomment-50262166","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1524","id":50262166,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMjYyMTY2","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-27T11:38:35Z","updated_at":"2014-07-27T11:38:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA tests have started for PR 1524.

see, my point was that we shouldn't try to make optimizations or major refactorings here. It makes it much harder to tell whether the code is correct, and this is code that's been tricky to debug, because it's split across two methods.\n\nI think you could make it much simpler as follows:\n- Don't add any extra parameters to resourceOffer\n- Call it with NO_PREFS after NODE_LOCAL\n- In resourceOffer, if the locality level passed in is NO_PREFS, don't adjust the locality (basically what your Boolean is doing, except that instead of being a Boolean, you just check whether the target level is NO_PREFS). (In fact if you'd like you can even have a separate top-level path in resourceOffer for NO_PREFS so that we don't have to have code dealing with it scattered throughout. That is, just make the call to NO_PREFS return _only_ no-prefs tasks, not process-local or node-local.)\n\nThe reason this is simpler is that every time you introduce parameters, people can pass in any combination of those parameters, and in fact in this code you only expect one particular combination. It's very hard for any new reader of the code to figure that out. The optimization with bottomLocality might be useful but it shouldn't be part of this bug fix PR -- this PR should just fix the bug. As I said before, I have my doubts that it will make a huge impact because I haven't seen this code be a bottleneck in profiles.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50288916/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50288953","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1313#issuecomment-50288953","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1313","id":50288953,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMjg4OTUz","user":{"login":"mateiz","id":228859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODg1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz","html_url":"https://github.com/mateiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-27T23:04:47Z","updated_at":"2014-07-27T23:04:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"BTW one other thing I should add is that it would be good to update the comments of these methods when you make a PR. For example, if you go with the way I suggested above, in resourceOffer you would say that it's either called with a \"real\" locality level, in which case it does delay scheduling, or with the special level NO_PREFS, in which case it checks for no-prefs tasks without adjusting its last locality value.

For the fix: I will make the length() function use the same character encoding as does Hive to keep it compatible.  The strlen() method will be the \"outlet\" to permit flexible handling of multi byte character sets in the general RDD (no strlen method is defined in hive proper).\n\n I am going to roll back just the hive portion of the commit, and will report back end of evening.\n\n udf_length **\\* FAILED ***\n[info]   Results do not match for udf_length:\n[info]   SELECT length(dest1.name) FROM dest1\n[info]   == Logical Plan ==\n[info]   Project [Length(name#41188) AS c_0#41186]\n[info]    MetastoreRelation default, dest1, None\n[info]  \n[info]   == Optimized Logical Plan ==\n[info]   Project [Length(name#41188) AS c_0#41186]\n[info]    MetastoreRelation default, dest1, None\n[info]  \n[info]   == Physical Plan ==\n[info]   Project [Length(name#41188:0) AS c_0#41186]\n[info]    HiveTableScan [name#41188], (MetastoreRelation default, dest1, None), None\n[info]   c_0\n[info]   !== HIVE - 1 row(s) ==   == CATALYST - 1 row(s) ==\n[info]   !2                       6 (HiveComparisonTest.scala:366)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50289795/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50289898","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1425#issuecomment-50289898","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1425","id":50289898,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMjg5ODk4","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-27T23:43:49Z","updated_at":"2014-07-27T23:43:49Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA tests have started for PR 1425.
