clean.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/284168931/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/284178354","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1536#issuecomment-284178354","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1536","id":284178354,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NDE3ODM1NA==","user":{"login":"joetrite","id":9666540,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NjY1NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9666540?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joetrite","html_url":"https://github.com/joetrite","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joetrite/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joetrite/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joetrite/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joetrite/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joetrite/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joetrite/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joetrite/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joetrite/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joetrite/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-04T20:25:04Z","updated_at":"2017-03-04T20:25:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"created

That user went far enough to create a nifi user. Any attackers could:\r\n\r\n- Find instance\r\n- Add ExecuteScript processor\r\n- Change `$NIFI_HOME/bin/nifi.sh` to obtain persistent control over the node (note that when running as a service, this is still run as root, with the privilege drop happening WITHIN the script, not before)\r\n- Use the machine to launch DDoS against users.\r\n\r\nA normal answer would be: Just change the permissions of `$NIFI_HOME/bin`. Fair enough! But the challenge is that due to to the way Unix/Linux ACLs work, in order to truly change the settings of `$NIFI_HOME/bin` you must change the settings of `$NIFI_HOME`, otherwise you can always:\r\n\r\n- Move the `bin` to `bin.old`\r\n- Create a new `bin` directory\r\n- Copy all content from `bin.old` the new `bin`\r\n- Modify `nifi.sh`\r\n- Wait for system to restart\r\nSource: [1]\r\n\r\nTo prevent the simple 3 steps above, we must change the permissions of $HOME_NIFI\r\n\r\nAnd the problem is: We cannot change the permissions of $HOME_NIFI without creating the directories representing the default settings, otherwise would crash on start, unable to start (due to permissions).\r\n\r\nSo long history short, the idea here isn't to randomly create things where we don't need them, I am just trying to avoid we fall into the MongoDB track of \"shipping with insecure default settings\" as this can easily tarnish a project reputation (my LinkedIn feed was full of sales rep from competitors spreading the word about MongoDBs ransomware woes).\r\n\r\nHope this helps to clarify what the objective of this PR is.\r\n\r\n[1]The first 3 steps of this technique is so old that I can't find references to it anymore, but IIRC, affected the good old SunOS 4.1.3. The two other steps have been used by me many times in PenTests.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/284268174/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/284291213","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1328#issuecomment-284291213","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1328","id":284291213,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NDI5MTIxMw==","user":{"login":"JPercivall","id":11302527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzAyNTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11302527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall","html_url":"https://github.com/JPercivall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-06T02:58:39Z","updated_at":"2017-03-06T02:58:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hey @trixpan, sorry for the delay but I just rebased it again.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/284291213/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/284293799","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1551#issuecomment-284293799","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1551","id":284293799,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NDI5Mzc5OQ==","user":{"login":"joewitt","id":3057465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTc0NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3057465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt","html_url":"https://github.com/joewitt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-06T03:22:18Z","updated_at":"2017-03-06T03:22:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It is prudent to restrict the ACLs of the files and directories we ship with to their most conservative level possible.  I'll refer to these as 'SA' (shipped artifacts) for my comments below.\r\n\r\nIt is also prudent to ensure we restrict the ACLs of the files and directories our code creates to their most conservative level possible.  I'll refer to these as 'CA' (created artifacts) for my comments below.\r\n\r\nWe control the permissions of SA through our build process which specifically is our maven assembly.  Your PR shows we have a few areas to tighten and we should.  These include, for example, the base install directory, the bin directory, the conf directory, NOTICE, LICENSE, etc..\r\n\r\nWe do not, until this PR, control the permissions of our CA through our build process/maven assembly.  Our CA items should be controlled by the code creating these items in the most restrictive way possible and through honoring operating system settings for things like umask, etc..  And we should have clearly documented and allocated area(s) where CA items under default settings would go in the event that they are actually invoked/created.\r\n\r\nFor cases where you'd like to make the base directory (an SA) more restrictive than it can presently be due to common/default settings that result in CA of things like flowfile/content/prov repositories then consider changing the default storage location of those CAs to a specifically controlled subdirectory like 'state' or something else.  We can then document this 'state' directory as the location accessible to the NiFi process to write to.  Keeping in mind of course that we have common practices today such as using conf directory for things like the flow.xml.gz and a directory under it for backup flows and so on.  There are some things to think through there.\r\n\r\nI think the mongodb lesson is important.  We have to continually revisit tradeoffs and decisions we've made regarding out of the box usability to support onboarding new users and the effort required to have a secured system.  We need to continually make 'out of the box ease' and 'security' come closer together.  I think we're all in agreement there.\r\n\r\nIn summary, I'm supportive of us finding the most restrictive SA configuration we can.  I think we should adjust our code that generates CAs to create things as restrictive as possible.  I do think we should avoid pre-generating CA artifacts.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/284293799/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/284297099","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1551#issuecomment-284297099","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1551","id":284297099,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NDI5NzA5OQ==","user":{"login":"trixpan","id":3108527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMDg1Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3108527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan","html_url":"https://github.com/trixpan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-06T03:55:20Z","updated_at":"2017-03-06T03:55:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@joewitt.

for the update @ambud, the tests are passing.

I recommend we do the same for table.name.\r\n\r\n2.) I looked for an established attribute naming convention that would apply to `table.name`.  \r\n* The ListDatabaseTables processor uses `db.table.name`, but it has a consistent `db.*` pattern for all of its attributes that QueryDatabaseTable does not.  \r\n* QueryDatabaseTable has `querydbtable.row.count`, which might suggest a `querydbtable.*` pattern like `querydbtable.table.name`, except that there is only one such attribute (the fragment attributes are idiomatic and might not apply, `maxvalue.*` is the only other existing attribute written).  \r\n\r\nHaving done this research, I'm now more confused than when I started :), so I don't have the concrete recommendation I was hoping to arrive at.  Have you looked into this, and how did you arrive at `table.name`?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/284500926/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/284553573","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1537#issuecomment-284553573","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1537","id":284553573,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NDU1MzU3Mw==","user":{"login":"ambud","id":9707358,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDczNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9707358?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambud","html_url":"https://github.com/ambud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-06T22:23:24Z","updated_at":"2017-03-06T22:23:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"1) Agreed, I overlooked it and will add that\r\n\r\n2) Ideally I would just do tablename (one word) without delimiters for simplicity of downstream processing.

A smaller unit test would still cover the issue and be clearer about the focus:\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    public void testParseSchemaCommaBoundary() {\r\n        final TestRunner runner = TestRunners.newTestRunner(new ValidateCsv());\r\n        runner.setProperty(ValidateCsv.SCHEMA, \"Null(),Null\");\r\n        runner.assertValid();\r\n    }\r\n    \r\nWhat do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/285146865/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/285151629","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1570#issuecomment-285151629","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1570","id":285151629,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NTE1MTYyOQ==","user":{"login":"pvillard31","id":11541012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTQxMDEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11541012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31","html_url":"https://github.com/pvillard31","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-08T20:00:03Z","updated_at":"2017-03-08T20:00:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hey @jvwing, thanks for the review!
