@sunjincheng121 for this great effort. I just quickly go through the changes, and have some design comments:\r\n1. It appears to me that i can't tell the differences between `Expression` and `PlannerExpression`. What are the scenarios for both expressions? Take `FilterableTableSource` for example, currently it takes a list of `Expression` for input. But clearly the method `applyPredicate` happens during optimize phase, my feeling is we should use `PlannerExpression` during optimize. (I know `FilterableTableSource` is API and should only accept `Expression` which is also an API, but the logic seems a little weird).\r\n\r\n2. What about we just use current `Expression` for API, by getting rid of the `toRexNode` method. The only problem is the number of expressions is quite big and keeps increasing. To solve this, we could follow the advices @twalthr had suggested, we categorize all expressions we currently have, and squash some all them. For example, we can squash \"IF\", \"ABS\" into `CallExpression`, and use `FunctionDefinition` to represent details information. Quite similar with Calcite's `RexNode` and `SqlOperator`. And for `ExpressionVisitor`, we can directly mapping `Expression` to `RexNode`, which seems to be much clearer.

The coexistence of Expression and PlannerExpression (the existing Expression has not changed) will greatly reduce the difficulty and workload of Blink merge. If I understand the comments in JIRA. correctly, @twalthr  also proposed this approach.\r\n\r\nRegarding to drop the existing(PlannerExpression) CAST, ALIAS, EQUALTO etc., more than 100 function call definitions is a big change, and when merging the Blink, we will also need to do this kind of work which introduce extra huge overhead. Therefore, I prefer to add a thin layer of Expression abstraction to the API in the current PR. After the Blink has been merged, we can unify the Expression by adding an expression visitor, e.g.: `XXX extends ExpressionVisitor[RexNode]`  which can translate an Expression to RexNode.\r\n\r\nIn short, I expect to complete uncouple the Expression from RexNodes in the most efficient way to reduce the work of Blink merging.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think ?

I have the feeling that multiple people would like to use this connector, and maybe get the attention of Google and some Google Cloud users with this effort :)\r\n\r\nBut I also see a few problems with this effort\r\nA) I haven't worked on the Flink codebase for over a year, so my reviewing skills are a bit rusty. I will try to mitigate this by asking for additional reviewing help once I've gone over the code once. But this means for you that there will be probably multiple rounds of reviews (and that I might comment on things which are not actually an issue).\r\nB) There is not much time left till the 1.8 release. I don't know how many things we find in the code that need to be addressed, and how much time you have to address them.\r\nC) I found already some issues in the code with respect to exception handling, logging, maybe performance. I also want to do some correctness testing (such as rescaling, failures etc.). Have you done such tests already? \r\n\r\nDespite these problems, I'm committed to get this in. I'd be happy to support an approach where we decide to list \"known issues\" in the documentation. Once the release is out, we iteratively open small pull requests (maybe with the help from others) to resolve the known issues (+ the feedback we get after the release).\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about this?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/463983792/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/463983839","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/7668#issuecomment-463983839","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/7668","id":463983839,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2Mzk4MzgzOQ==","user":{"login":"uce","id":1756620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTY2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1756620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce","html_url":"https://github.com/uce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-15T10:16:47Z","updated_at":"2019-02-15T10:16:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@zentol I added a `[hotfix]` commit for the reordering (before all changes of this PR) and added a short options test.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/463983839/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/463987393","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3511#issuecomment-463987393","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3511","id":463987393,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2Mzk4NzM5Mw==","user":{"login":"p16i","id":1214890,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQ4OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214890?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/p16i","html_url":"https://github.com/p16i","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/p16i/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/p16i/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/p16i/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/p16i/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/p16i/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/p16i/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/p16i/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/p16i/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/p16i/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-15T10:26:13Z","updated_at":"2019-02-15T10:26:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Actually, the original ideas were from @ggevay.
