OpenCV (Open Computer Vision).\n .\n The Open Computer Vision Library is a collection of algorithms and sample\n code for various computer vision problems. The library is compatible with\n IPL (Intel's Image Processing Library) and, if available, can use IPP\n (Intel's Integrated Performance Primitives) for better performance.\n .\n OpenCV provides low level portable data types and operators, and a set\n of high level functionalities for video acquisition, image processing and\n analysis, structural analysis, motion analysis and object tracking, object\n recognition, camera calibration and 3D reconstruction.\nDescription-md5: f9dc67381f1013c39fe59842c79cbddf\nHomepage: http://opencv.org/\nBugs: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+filebug\nOrigin: Ubuntu\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/160413700/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/160432672","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/583#issuecomment-160432672","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/583","id":160432672,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MDQzMjY3Mg==","user":{"login":"kayhan-batmanghelich","id":12301533,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzAxNTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12301533?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayhan-batmanghelich","html_url":"https://github.com/kayhan-batmanghelich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayhan-batmanghelich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayhan-batmanghelich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayhan-batmanghelich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayhan-batmanghelich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayhan-batmanghelich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayhan-batmanghelich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayhan-batmanghelich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayhan-batmanghelich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayhan-batmanghelich/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-29T17:13:58Z","updated_at":"2015-11-29T17:13:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @korneil, thanks for the post.
