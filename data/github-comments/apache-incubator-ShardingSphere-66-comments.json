Therefore, the DataSource you mentioned is definitely not supported, and the existing sharding-jdbc implementation also cannot support this. Since sharding-jdbc encapsulates the connection pool component, it must use the XADataSource to make the connection pool component access the TransactionManager to perform the enlistmenet/delistment.
