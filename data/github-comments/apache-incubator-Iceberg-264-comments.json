Instead, it adds a brand-new column with a fresh ID that happens to have the same name as one of the columns that were dropped earlier. That's why the CDC procedure, which acts according to the current schema, outputs nulls for `name` in old columns. From the Iceberg perspective, original files from the first snapshot did not have `name` as the column ID was different.\r\n\r\nThis behavior is intentional to avoid surprises when a column is dropped and a new one added a few years after and suddenly old data starts to appear in the query output. It is possible to restore an old column but it is not done via ALTER TABLE ADD/DROP COLUMN.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1629687495/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1629782393","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/8015#issuecomment-1629782393","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/8015","id":1629782393,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85hJIF5","user":{"login":"mr-brobot","id":18426892,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2ODky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18426892?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr-brobot","html_url":"https://github.com/mr-brobot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr-brobot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr-brobot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr-brobot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr-brobot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr-brobot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr-brobot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr-brobot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr-brobot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr-brobot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-10T21:53:44Z","updated_at":"2023-07-10T21:53:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> It would be nice if a pool can be reused.

some reason my big comment was collapsed:\r\n\r\nSince Arrow is column-oriented, I'm sure that it will follow the order of the write schema:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/assets/1134248/5dd5016e-7761-4cdc-a169-d3c4744c581b)\r\n\r\nThe reason I try to avoid using too many internal details from PyArrow is that we support PyArrow `[9.0.0, 12.0.1]` currently. There is no guarantee that all these internals stay the same, therefore I think we should do as much as possible within our own control (also regarding the internal Parquet types, or how the column names are structured).\r\n\r\nWe already have the write schema, so we can easily filter out the primitive types:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass PyArrowStatisticsCollector(PreOrderSchemaVisitor[List[StatisticsCollector]]):\r\n    _field_id = 0\r\n    _schema: Schema\r\n    _properties: Properties\r\n\r\n    def __init__(self, schema: Schema, properties: Dict[str, str]):\r\n        self._schema = schema\r\n        self._properties = properties\r\n\r\n    def schema(self, schema: Schema, struct_result: Callable[[], List[StatisticsCollector]]) -> List[StatisticsCollector]:\r\n        return struct_result()\r\n\r\n    def struct(self, struct: StructType, field_results: List[Callable[[], List[StatisticsCollector]]]) -> List[StatisticsCollector]:\r\n        return list(chain(*[result() for result in field_results]))\r\n\r\n    def field(self, field: NestedField, field_result: Callable[[], List[StatisticsCollector]]) -> List[StatisticsCollector]:\r\n        self._field_id = field.field_id\r\n        result = field_result()\r\n        return result\r\n\r\n    def list(self, list_type: ListType, element_result: Callable[[], List[StatisticsCollector]]) -> List[StatisticsCollector]:\r\n        self._field_id = list_type.element_id\r\n        return element_result()\r\n\r\n    def map(self, map_type: MapType, key_result: Callable[[], List[StatisticsCollector]], value_result: Callable[[], List[StatisticsCollector]]) -> List[StatisticsCollector]:\r\n        self._field_id = map_type.key_id\r\n        k = key_result()\r\n        self._field_id = map_type.value_id\r\n        v = value_result()\r\n        return k + v\r\n\r\n    def primitive(self, primitive: PrimitiveType) -> List[StatisticsCollector]:\r\n        return [StatisticsCollector(\r\n            field_id=self._field_id,\r\n            iceberg_type=primitive,\r\n            mode=MetricsMode.TRUNC\r\n            # schema\r\n            # self._properties.get(f\"write.metadata.metrics.column.{schema.find_column_name(self._field_id)}\")\r\n        )]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis way we get a nice list of columns that we need to collect statistics for. We have:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@dataclass(frozen=True)\r\nclass StatisticsCollector:\r\n    field_id: int\r\n    iceberg_type: PrimitiveType\r\n    mode: MetricsMode\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere we can use the `field_id` to properly populate the maps, and the `iceberg_type` to feed into `to_bytes` to do the conversion (so we don't have to have yet another one for PyArrow).\r\n\r\nI did a quick test, and it seems to work:\r\n```python\r\ndef test_complex_schema(table_schema_nested: Schema):\r\n    tbl = pa.Table.from_pydict({\r\n        \"foo\": [\"a\", \"b\"],\r\n        \"bar\": [1, 2],\r\n        \"baz\": [False, True],\r\n        \"qux\": [[\"a\", \"b\"], [\"c\", \"d\"]],\r\n        \"quux\": [[(\"a\", ((\"aa\", 1), (\"ab\", 2)))], [(\"b\", ((\"ba\", 3), (\"bb\", 4)))]],\r\n        \"location\": [[(52.377956, 4.897070), (4.897070, -122.431297)],\r\n                     [(43.618881, -116.215019), (41.881832, -87.623177)]],\r\n        \"person\": [(\"Fokko\", 33), (\"Max\", 42)]  # Possible data quality issue\r\n    },\r\n        schema=schema_to_pyarrow(table_schema_nested)\r\n    )\r\n    stats_columns = pre_order_visit(table_schema_nested, PyArrowStatisticsCollector(table_schema_nested, {}))\r\n\r\n    visited_paths = []\r\n\r\n    def file_visitor(written_file: Any) -> None:\r\n        visited_paths.append(written_file)\r\n\r\n    with TemporaryDirectory() as tmpdir:\r\n        pq.write_to_dataset(tbl, tmpdir, file_visitor=file_visitor)\r\n\r\n    assert visited_paths[0].metadata.num_columns == len(stats_columns)\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1631183637/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1631216990","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/7933#issuecomment-1631216990","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/7933","id":1631216990,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85hOmVe","user":{"login":"szehon-ho","id":20555759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTU1NzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20555759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho","html_url":"https://github.com/szehon-ho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-11T17:28:53Z","updated_at":"2023-07-11T17:28:53Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Hm..

In this example we didn't necessarily expect that the two columns with the same name to line up in the changelog. We did that when we noticed that the column disappeared from the changelog after we dropped it to try to figure out if it would come back and how.\r\n\r\nThe use case here is that we want to keep track of the changes made by the users on those tables for quality purpose. Basically we want to be able to easily answer the question \"What happened to that datapoint during the last week\" and see the modifications made for that period of time. In that context we'd like to see the records as of that modification.\r\n\r\nIn that case i think it would be acceptable to see two columns with the same name in the changelog or to return the column ids and let us resolve them afterward. Still it would be difficult to make the difference between \"this column was there with null values\" vs \" this column wasn't there at that time\" but we could display the schema changes separately.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1632242215/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1632438087","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/8031#issuecomment-1632438087","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/8031","id":1632438087,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85hTQdH","user":{"login":"nastra","id":271029,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MTAyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/271029?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra","html_url":"https://github.com/nastra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-12T12:26:26Z","updated_at":"2023-07-12T12:26:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I agree that this is suprising behavior from an end user's perspective, but it is expected according to https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/223177faf955bd8f11864477da16013cf5d7cc75/core/src/test/java/org/apache/iceberg/TestUpdatePartitionSpec.java#L204-L206\r\n\r\nThis is what makes https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/latest/evolution/#partition-evolution properly work","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1632438087/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1632609309","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/7933#issuecomment-1632609309","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/7933","id":1632609309,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85hT6Qd","user":{"login":"ConeyLiu","id":12733256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzMzMjU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12733256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu","html_url":"https://github.com/ConeyLiu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-12T14:14:10Z","updated_at":"2023-07-12T14:14:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @szehon-ho @chenjunjiedada I comment in the comments thread.

Let me elaborate. It is sticking to the spec on the read side. In the spec, the `current-snapshot-id`, `properties`, and `snapshots` fields can be omitted, but the parser doesn't allow this. \r\n\r\nThe Java code still writes a `-1` when writing a Metadata JSON:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/531bf9de69aac73b14bb6e7dccc0917da522c11c/core/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/TableMetadataParser.java#L216-L218\r\n\r\nBut I don't want to change that today, since other readers might expect a -1 instead of omitting the field (I know Athena does). I think aking sure that the read-side adheres to the spec is a good first step.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1633787010/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1633918501","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/7988#issuecomment-1633918501","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/7988","id":1633918501,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85hY54l","user":{"login":"Neuw84","id":5920770,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MjA3NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5920770?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neuw84","html_url":"https://github.com/Neuw84","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neuw84/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neuw84/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neuw84/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neuw84/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neuw84/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neuw84/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neuw84/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neuw84/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neuw84/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-13T09:46:34Z","updated_at":"2023-07-13T09:46:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Done with the required changes. \r\n\r\nFor `ManifestReadBenchmark` I have also changed the `Files.createTemp` from Guava as it collides with `java.nio.File.Files` and the change was small. \r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1633918501/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1634209715","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/7226#issuecomment-1634209715","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/7226","id":1634209715,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85haA-z","user":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-13T13:04:43Z","updated_at":"2023-07-13T13:04:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@shuvaevv Sorry for the late reply, I missed this one.

Just out curiosity, where are you able to run multi-processing?\r\n\r\n@Fokko I was on Ubuntu [where the start method defaults to `fork`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#contexts-and-start-methods). Since Windows & macOS default to the `spawn` method, and that is [considerably slower due to re-initialization of a new Python interpreter](https://peps.python.org/pep-0703/#multiprocessing), I think we should advise against multi-processing on these platforms in our documentation and perhaps log a warning.\r\n\r\nIn fact, in a previous version of this PR, I thought to fall back to multi-threading when the start mode was `spawn`:\r\n```python\r\ndef _mp_pref() -> bool:\r\n    \"\"\"Returns whether multiprocessing is preferred.\"\"\"\r\n    start_method = get_start_method()\r\n\r\n    if start_method != \"fork\":\r\n        logger.debug(\"Multi-processing not preferred in current runtime: start_method=%s\", start_method)\r\n        return False\r\n\r\n    return start_method == \"fork\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'll add some documentation after I do some testing with process spawning on Windows & macOS. \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1634687728/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1634809059","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/8059#issuecomment-1634809059","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/8059","id":1634809059,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85hcTTj","user":{"login":"szehon-ho","id":20555759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTU1NzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20555759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho","html_url":"https://github.com/szehon-ho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-13T19:42:00Z","updated_at":"2023-07-13T19:42:00Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"@aokolnychyi  added a test with partition transform (as discussed offline )","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1634809059/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1634971827","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/7295#issuecomment-1634971827","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/7295","id":1634971827,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85hc7Cz","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-13T21:57:23Z","updated_at":"2023-07-13T21:57:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think this is a good idea.

Making PyIceberg work in serverless is simple. Replacing usage of `multiprocessing.pool.ThreadPool` and related synchronization concepts with `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` and the corresponding synchronization concepts in `threading`.\r\n2. Making PyIceberg support multi-processing adds variability across platforms and would require more care when introducing future changes (e.g., ensuring that everything parallelized by an executor can be pickled).\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this and reopen a separate PR focused on (1). For (2), I will create yet another PR where I will dedicate more attention to testing all platforms and possibly some benchmarks that prove the
