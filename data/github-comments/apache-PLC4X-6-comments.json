If its `String` then, output is not an array but, just an string.

You can also ignore all major, minor, or patch releases for a dependency by adding an [`ignore`

all, \r\nwe took a look to the dynamic properties, now the processor supports both methods to specify variable addresses: using PlcAddressString property and using dynamic properties. We added another property (selector), to select the desired method to specify these variables. In this way, we can test both methods, and in the future we can decide which one we prefer\r\n\r\nalso, we rewrote the Plc4xCommon.parseAddressString() method, using StringUtils library. Here, another approach was to parse the string as a CSV to get the objects. With the later, we did some tests, but didn't added it to the commit, maybe you can take a look and give some feedback here.\r\n\r\nlastly, we looked at the dependency version change suggestions ( https://github.com/apache/plc4x/pull/439/checks?check_run_id=7654047052 ), we found that some nifi dependencies are using avro 1.8.1 which is causing the conflicts, although it is supposed to be fixed already..  we maintained it, and added a exclusion for the commons-compress dep, which I think know is provided by the parent projects.\r\n\r\nlet us know what you think, thank you!

I won't notify you again about this release, but will get in touch when a new version is available. If you'd rather skip all updates until the next major or minor version, let me know by commenting `@dependabot ignore this major version` or `@dependabot ignore this minor version`. You can also ignore all major, minor, or patch releases for a dependency by adding an [`ignore` condition](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/configuration-options-for-dependency-updates#ignore) with the desired `update_types` to your config file.\n\nIf you change
