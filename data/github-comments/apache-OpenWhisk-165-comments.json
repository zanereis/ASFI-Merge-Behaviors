Based on your feedback, I modified below - \r\n\r\n- More defensive checks when parsing the result response. \r\n  - if the result response contains an `error` field, check if it has `statusCode` defined by the user, as other fields are discarded if the `error` field is present in result response. \r\n     ```json\r\n     \"result\": {\r\n            \"error\": {\r\n                \"body\": \"Authentication credentials are invalid.\",\r\n                \"statusCode\": 401\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n     ````\r\n  - else check if `statusCode` is set by the user without the `error` field in the result response.\r\n     ```json\r\n     \"result\": {\r\n                \"body\": \"Authentication credentials are invalid.\",\r\n                \"statusCode\": 401\r\n        }\r\n     ````\r\n  - `statusCode` value is being checked for valid integer (401) and string value (\"401\").\r\n  -  If there is any issue in getting the `intValue` (i.e. `statusCode` like \"i401\" or any string \"xyz\") return set `userDefinedStatusCode as `400`. \r\n  - Using `value.convertTo[BigInt].intValue()` takes care of `JSNumber` and `JSString` type. I tried alternate approach like handling the status code for webaction https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/blob/master/core/controller/src/main/scala/org/apache/openwhisk/core/controller/WebActions.scala#L234, but for normal action use case it will miss a case where return `statusCode` is a valid integer (like \"1\") but not a http statusCode.\r\n-  Changed `actionStatusCode` to `userDefinedStatusCode` as `statusCode` is not limited to http status codes. Please let me know if you have any better suggestions. \r\n-  Other tests and doc changes per feedback. \r\n\r\nPlease let me know your feedback.

I first attempted to run from source but the java 8 runtime we're publishing isn't the action loop version so it requires a JAR. :/ The build script will make sure java 8 is available since the versions must match.\r\n\r\nRather than figure out how to build Ballerina and Dotnet from source, I just removed them. The unicode test is checked anyway in the action runtime basic tests.\r\n\r\nThat leaves the Gatling test. Will just build it from source like the unicode test.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/562172966/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/562180194","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/4630#issuecomment-562180194","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/4630","id":562180194,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MjE4MDE5NA==","user":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-05T15:30:50Z","updated_at":"2019-12-05T15:30:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Now gatling test is build from source also.

Any performance comparison will be against a hosted deployment and configuration that requires both a benchmarking methodology and a calibration for comparable resources (can't compare an openwhisk deployment with 2 invokers to AWS lambda with hundreds of servers). So a meaningful head to head will be against a hosted provider. \r\n\r\nThat said, we have added performance benchmarks in the tests folder (using gatling and owperf).
