The time window of 1 minute and 60 firings are whisk limit properties and these can be adjusted as needed if we start changing the way we throttle.\n2) The parameter maximumInvoke of 120 is really a testing parameter and perhaps shoud be restated as 2*maximumFirings to show that we decide to go at twice the throttle rate to trigger it.\n3) Once something is throttled, it would be great if you could stop the Future's that have not been fired from occurring.  One way would be through a condition variable but I leave it to you to do it or not.  It would be good to know how long this test takes on average to complete.  In a perfect world, it would be 1 minute.  When one gets unlucky, it would be 2 minutes if we coded things well.

It took me some time to understand what was going on since I was still looking at the python cli. For now, locally, I'll make the test use the python cli, but it would be nice if we fix this because the only sequence test we have right now is actually not exercising the code that (currently)

@andrepoleza for your interest in OpenWhisk.\nWe have no specific reason why the CLI is not available thru Homebrew.\nI think homebrew is a good way of installing dev tools, and it could be a good vehicle to distribute the CLI.\n\nLike anything it would take effort to get it done and also maintain it current (automation CI/CD).\n\nWe also need to do some bit of research on how to handle, nightly publish vs. a stable build with the current situation that the CLI doesn't have a semantic version only a hash or build id (i.e. date stamp)\n\nI think after we figured out this we could also potentially offer the CLI thru other package manager (i.e. npm install -g whisk-cli)\n\nI will keep the issue open to keep this a a enhancement

However, what appears to be missing is documentation describing this new system. Individual action runners have certain obligations and opportunities to customize the way their container runs by implementing one or more of the lifecycle functions defined by the base ActionRunner (e.g. `epilogue`, `verify`, `build`, etc.). However, I don't see any documentation describing these aspects.\n\nI think it would be valuable to have either comments in `actionproxy.py` describing the lifecycle and customization points or, perhaps better, a separate document describing how to create a new action container.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/240103095/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/240108379","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/1068#issuecomment-240108379","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/1068","id":240108379,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MDEwODM3OQ==","user":{"login":"ioana-blue","id":17202292,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjAyMjky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17202292?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue","html_url":"https://github.com/ioana-blue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-16T13:53:27Z","updated_at":"2016-08-16T13:53:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Registrator is nice because it watches containers going down and up.
