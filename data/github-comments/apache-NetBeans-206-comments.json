You can build/debug/run them directly from within NB like a maven project.\r\n\r\nThe module dependencies are in each modules project.xml file (e.g https://github.com/mbien/netbeans/blob/3917a2a04e5af314b9b21e754c5097e05b2fcd90/ide/gsf.codecoverage/nbproject/project.xml). Most of it can be edited using the regular project properties UI (right click on project).\r\n\r\nSo you would have to identify what internal API you want to access too, then make it public. (I haven't really looked into the API yet, It might be just a matter of switching it from internal/friend to public)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2059723358/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2059734119","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/7201#issuecomment-2059734119","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/7201","id":2059734119,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M56xQxn","user":{"login":"mbien","id":114367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien","html_url":"https://github.com/mbien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-16T18:52:47Z","updated_at":"2024-04-16T18:52:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@lahodaj although I do like the changes here, I am a bit worried that this could cause unexpected issues.

Before you answered I had already checked, that compilation of the projects does not change anything. But if you added the library project to the module path of the application project and not to the classpath of the project, then I can reproduce your observation.\r\nIf you really added the project to the module path, then this is not a NetBeans issue, but a misunderstand what the module path is and how it differs from the classpath.\r\n@pedro-w did the right thing by sharing the project he created. Please do so too.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2060470706/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2060504988","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/7268#issuecomment-2060504988","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/7268","id":2060504988,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M560M-c","user":{"login":"sdedic","id":26788611,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg4NjEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26788611?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic","html_url":"https://github.com/sdedic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-17T06:51:02Z","updated_at":"2024-04-17T06:51:02Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hm, so TODO is - how to retain language richness in absence of installable JDK components.... maybe time for some more modules; if we want to retain the functionality.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2060504988/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2060559836","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/6588#issuecomment-2060559836","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/6588","id":2060559836,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M560aXc","user":{"login":"jroman","id":1663110,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjMxMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1663110?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroman","html_url":"https://github.com/jroman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-17T07:24:08Z","updated_at":"2024-04-17T07:40:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for your reply!\r\n\r\nThat worked for me.

Simply get in touch via issue/discussion/mailing list and say that you are planning to open a PR next time. It was a coincidence that I saw the article (someone PMed me the link via slack), I didn't look at the date - I simply assumed that there won't be any followup after checking PRs and mails so I did it myself via #7284.\r\n\r\nLuckily a lot of this was dead code or an edge case with little impact (e.g one issue would swap left and right of the diff view under certain conditions), at least one other hit was already fixed in master at this point. But the blog post was good inspiration to run some inspections myself, e.g I found some more endless recursion cases by running the NetBeans inspection on the code base or by checking for other patterns with a jackpot rule. I left a few things out which are inactive/or should be removed anyway (jnlp related code).\r\n\r\nThe most interesting case to me was probably the loop in `SchemaReferenceProxy.java`, although I didn't have time to check under what conditions the code runs.\r\n\r\nAnd yeah one dev really liked using `!!!` almost 25 years ago.
