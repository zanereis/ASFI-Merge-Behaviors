Some notes below:\r\n\r\n`AccessModifier.PROTECTED` doesn't make a lot of sense since `Immutable` classes are final. Another option would be to also drop package private and switch to just a Boolean `privateConstructors` but I think having a general purpose enum is probably going to be more consistent in the long run if we need this capability in other places later, so I'd probably just leave it.\r\n\r\nCurrently you can use `@Immutable` in conjunction with `@Builder`, e.g.:\r\n```\r\n@Immutable @Builder(builderStrategy=InitializerStrategy)\r\nclass Person { String name }\r\ndef john = new Person(Person.createInitializer().name('John'))\r\n```\r\nI'd just note that the current PR doesn't change the visibility of the constructor supplied by `@Builder`. We could make the Builder transform peak into the Immutable definition or perhaps instead have an independent marker annotation that builder, immutable, canonical, MapConstructor, TupleConstructor etc. could look for, e.g. `@Constructor(visibility=Visibility.PRIVATE)` or `@Visibility(constructor=Visibility.PRIVATE)`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/331704673/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/331855708","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/597#issuecomment-331855708","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/597","id":331855708,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMTg1NTcwOA==","user":{"login":"apupier","id":1105127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDUxMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1105127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apupier","html_url":"https://github.com/apupier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apupier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apupier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apupier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apupier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apupier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apupier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apupier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apupier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apupier/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-25T11:42:14Z","updated_at":"2017-09-25T11:42:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> @apupier, In the IVY JIRA you filed originally, can you add the steps that I can follow to reproduce this issue?\r\n\r\nJust to be sure that you noticed it, I provided the steps few days ago: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GROOVY-8305?focusedCommentId=16167801&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-16167801","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/331855708/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/331871171","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/597#issuecomment-331871171","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/597","id":331871171,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMTg3MTE3MQ==","user":{"login":"jaikiran","id":143523,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzUyMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/143523?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaikiran","html_url":"https://github.com/jaikiran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaikiran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaikiran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaikiran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaikiran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaikiran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaikiran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaikiran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaikiran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaikiran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-25T12:52:31Z","updated_at":"2017-09-25T12:52:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@apupier, I wasn't following that JIRA so hadn't noticed your update which included the steps to reproduce.

The class comments show an example and explains why the individual methods are needed and they are statically linked to in generated bytecode by the `CallsiteWriter`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/336683583/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/336684882","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/604#issuecomment-336684882","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/604","id":336684882,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNjY4NDg4Mg==","user":{"login":"jwagenleitner","id":97695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3Njk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/97695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner","html_url":"https://github.com/jwagenleitner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-15T04:04:31Z","updated_at":"2017-10-15T04:04:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/336684882/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/336754879","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/618#issuecomment-336754879","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/618","id":336754879,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNjc1NDg3OQ==","user":{"login":"nektro","id":5464072,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NjQwNzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5464072?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nektro","html_url":"https://github.com/nektro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nektro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nektro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nektro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nektro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nektro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nektro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nektro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nektro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nektro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-16T00:51:13Z","updated_at":"2017-10-16T00:51:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@jwagenleitner sorry about that didn't see that it wasn't used in your actual program.
