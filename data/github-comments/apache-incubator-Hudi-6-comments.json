on an initial investigation using the worst possible workload (a single column projection has excellent parquet/columnar performance, while row based data is fully read & deserialized)\r\n\r\n```\r\nselect count(`_hoodie_record_key`)  from table where datestr>{date_range} \r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's what we found : \r\n\r\n- As long as the scans are small (<100GB) we expect to see < 10% variance in the query run time and even if the scans are not massive (scanning more than 500GB of data), we expect to see < 20%. \r\n- For scanning more than 500GB of data, the choice between RTView and ROView becomes significant based on use-case. Things like a ML training pipeline that scours a lot of data, can simply go to ROView \r\n- When fast data reaches more than 50GB, we see almost double the query latency. Note: This cost also depends on amount of cold data scanned. Remember this is the worst performance as the test query is doing a single flat column projection - which performs the best on cold data and does not help scans on the fast data much.\r\n- Memory and CPU usage is increased for small scans as updates are loaded into memory and conditional checks are added to merge fast data with cold data. But this evens out for big scans. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n|Parquet Data (GB) | Log Data (GB) | Query Latency Increase % | Memory(% increase) | Cumulative CPU(% increase)|\r\n| -- | -- | -- |-- |-- |\r\n|0.505 | 0.232 | 5.555555556 | 40.81746766 | 61.37638199\r\n|15 | 3 | 7.575757576 | 49.52813364 | 68.70778338\r\n|57 | 8 | 2 | 46.978982 | 70.02830956\r\n|142 | 23 | 20.68965517 | 12.33708618 | 64.71884707\r\n|561 | 65 | 129.7959184 | 3.410041347 | 42.06951578\r\n|906 | 72 | 106.9090909 | 19.08305902 | 17.53314515\r\n|998 | 75 | 28.85117493 | 15.31893635 | 8.356814546\r\n\r\n\r\nBut, again, this gives you real-time & read-optimized views all at the same time! 1 system!

Guess, is forcing `convertMetastoreParquet=false` would get Spark to call ipf.getSplits() which does the job and later only valid splits are passed into the closure returned from FileFormat\r\n - Per code in `DataSource.scala` pruning paths in the `path` option before creating the relation would work too \r\n\r\n```\r\ncase (format: FileFormat, _) =>\r\n        val allPaths = caseInsensitiveOptions.get(\"path\") ++ paths\r\n        val hadoopConf = sparkSession.sessionState.newHadoopConf()\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/334793365/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/334814392","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/247#issuecomment-334814392","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/247","id":334814392,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNDgxNDM5Mg==","user":{"login":"n3nash","id":2722167,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MjIxNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2722167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash","html_url":"https://github.com/n3nash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-06T17:07:38Z","updated_at":"2017-10-06T17:07:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@vinothchandar Please have a look at the metadata re-factored changes. \r\nI also tested this with an ingestion (performed rollback), registered the table and queried it, the queries run fine but I wasn't able to test failure scenarios etc with an ingestion job, I think I'll run these tests when I'm done with other items of MOR so for now it should be fine i think.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/334814392/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/335223797","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/247#issuecomment-335223797","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/247","id":335223797,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNTIyMzc5Nw==","user":{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-09T17:21:38Z","updated_at":"2017-10-09T17:21:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@n3nash are you suggesting this is the final review?

This file is written only once (when the dataset is created) and not updated during the life-cycle of the dataset. This means clients cannot change their PayloadClass during the lifecycle of the dataset. Given that this payloadclass will ultimately also lie in the Hive servers (for realtimeinputstream), should we keep the hoodie.properties immutable ? \r\n\r\nI also noticed that we have a mix of 2 spaces and 4 spaces in many classes. According to the developer docs, I think you guys chose to have 2 spaces : https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s4.2-block-indentation. The problem I noticed is that my Intellij defaults to a profile with 4 spaces. I noticed that the classes under hoodie-spark also have 4 spaces which might mean your IDE defaults to something similar. I'll fix my IDE to make sure I follow 2 spaces.

As the name suggests, this implementation is AppendOnly, which means a key's value can be altered but it cannot be deleted, this makes handling deletes difficult. If we were to write our own implementation of a spillable map to support deletes, we'd run into the same issue as is the problem with this implementation (deleting data on disk which was spilled). \r\n\r\nTo be able to use a spill based model for `CompactedLogScanner`, I'm suggesting the following changes\r\n\r\n1. Remove concept of HoodieDeleteBlock. Essentially, for a deleted record entry, just write a HoodieRecord with an empty data value as part of the record. \r\n2. The `CompactedLogScanner` still merges the values for a particular key, which if deleted, will end up with a final merged view as a HoodieRecord with a empty data value.\r\n\r\nHow to delete records ?\r\n1. On Disk, i.e, Compaction -> This is already handled in `HoodieMergeHandle` in COW, if there is a HoodieRecord with an empty data we skip writing it out to new compacted parquet file.\r\nSee here : https://github.com/uber/hoodie/blob/master/hoodie-client/src/main/java/com/uber/hoodie/io/HoodieMergeHandle.java#L136\r\n\r\n2. In Memory, i.e, RTView -> `HoodieRealTimeInputFormat` and in turn `HoodieRealtimeRecordReader` at the moment just replaces data from old parquet with data from log files (returned from `CompactedLogScanner`). This means if the data is already written in the parquet file, removing from log files actually does not mean complete deletion. So this is actually NOT working as expected. See here : https://github.com/uber/hoodie/blob/master/hoodie-hadoop-mr/src/main/java/com/uber/hoodie/hadoop/realtime/HoodieRealtimeRecordReader.java#L297\r\n\r\nInstead, what I'm proposing is as follows : \r\na. `CompactedLogScanner` returns all records, even records which are meant to be deleted, with the data value as empty. So, no `HoodieDeleteBlock` required.\r\nb. `HoodieRealtimeRecordReader` now iterates over the scanner records, if we find data value as empty, we update deltaRecordMap with the latest value. Now, when calling the next(..) method in `HoodieRealtimeRecordReader` we check if the value of record in `deltaRecordMap` is empty, if yes, then invoke the next(..) command again until a non-deleted record is found or the whole parquet file is read, whichever happens first. \r\n\r\nPlease let me know your thoughts.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/347627800/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/347708893","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/134#issuecomment-347708893","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/134","id":347708893,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NzcwODg5Mw==","user":{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-29T00:15:58Z","updated_at":"2017-11-29T00:15:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":">  this implementation is AppendOnly, which means a key's value can be altered \r\nI have not dug much into it myself.

That's why I left the `compacted` naming there. Another way could be to re-factor all test cases to getCompletedCommitTimeline.filter(\"commit\") to get the `compacted` timeline only but that seems repetitive and should be in one place.
