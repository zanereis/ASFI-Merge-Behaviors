We did consider the Proxy route where we would modify the Druid query with a extension.  However, we are currently testing passing into Superset as part of authentication/authorization specific user-defined variables (analogous to your \"Region\"). These can be defined in a custom superset-config.py. Once passed, the idea would be to eedit or extend the base Views to force a filter clause.    In our case the Druid issued query would have a FILTER applied so the user would see his/her relevant \"records\".  This is the general idea but something we are trying since Druid expects the application layer to define this.   I do agree this is something that would be great if it were standard.

The idea would be on the login (from an external context) you would set a specific USER \"Session\" value, for example \"Region\" and that would be defined in some data store outside of Superset.  This would then be a variable you can use in viz.py. By doing this, upon login a user would have a set of \"session variables\" which can then be used with a customized \"Gamma\" role in Flask App Builder.   You would then \"restrict\"outbound queries to filter per the logic you need. E.g user A belonging to Region X would default all outbound queries to have that condition in the payload.  As i mentioned, this is an approach we are evaluating but I recommend you work with your team on how users are defined in your organization and how they may be planning to integrate.

@john-bodley , @timifasubaa ,\r\n\r\nIn general, the technical process of a SQL Lab presto query is as follows:\r\n\r\n- Step A: Superset send presto query\r\n- Step B: Presto accept query request and schedule to run this query\r\n- Step C: Presto run and finish the query\r\n- Step D: Superset polling presto for query status\r\n- Step E: Superset get the query result back (this include data transfer between presto and lumos, for big queries, this really take some time)\r\n- Step F: Superset parse the query result, load it to memory, and then send the data back to browser\r\n- Step G: Browser take some time to load the data\r\n\r\nStep C, D, E, F occupies 90% time of the whole cycle, and Step C, E, F is not feabible for easy optimizations. My optimization focus on step D, and get rid of 80% of unnecessary pollings, which, as you can see, lead to a 2-5x improvement for end-to-end performance.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nI've added some debug info to the default presto polling process, and here's a sample debugging output for a query with 1 million output rows:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1164623/40982425-ce995120-690f-11e8-8a97-562c880e9b98.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1164623/40982324-9418f398-690f-11e8-9ebd-54f9828e1f2a.png)\r\n\r\nIn our environment, this query takes Presto 7 minutes to finish, and takes **additional 15 minutes** for superset to get the final data.\r\n\r\nIn **Step D**, it send about 540 queries just to polling the progress, and the polling will end when `self._nextUri` becomes None. However, the presto query has already finished long before `self._nextUri` becomes None. Actually, the presto query has finished when `stats.get('state') == 'FINISHED'`.\r\n\r\nSo my patch just utilize this kind of private internal presto API, and removes the unnecessary polling queries.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nHere's a benchmark report from our own production server (please ignore that lumos is our internal branch name):\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1164623/40982655-5e0b8d96-6910-11e8-8622-d739114fc8aa.png)\r\n\r\nI've also test the consistency of data before and after patch and it works to be the same data result.\r\n\r\nOne potential risk is, I'm not an expert of Presto, so the internal json response maybe changed in Presto, and this may be break.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/394732821/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/394763705","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/5132#issuecomment-394763705","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/5132","id":394763705,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NDc2MzcwNQ==","user":{"login":"john-bodley","id":4567245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjcyNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4567245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley","html_url":"https://github.com/john-bodley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-05T15:56:06Z","updated_at":"2018-06-05T15:56:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks @xiaohanyu for the detailed explanation.

Or should it just add wrap on top of it? In the current implementation (of this un-rebased branch), the limit is applied as a wrap, and I think that makes more sense, as it separates the underlying query component from the limiting component, and it is clear that the limiting only happens in the SQL Lab context. But in the to-be-rebased version it seems like I have to choose between the SQL editor limit (that is fetched with regex) vs. the `LimitControl` field's limit.\r\n\r\nFor example, if I have a query like:\r\n```\r\nSELECT * FROM birth_names LIMIT 1000\r\n```\r\nand the `LimitControl` field has a value of `100`, the current version of the code (in my un-rebased branch) would generate:\r\n```\r\nSELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM birth_names LIMIT 1000) as subquery LIMIT 100\r\n```\r\nwhereas in the to-be-rebased version, I have to apply either `1000` or `100`, unless I change some functionality in `db_engine_specs`, or have database-specific configurations for wrapping vs forcing a limit.\r\n\r\nThis can lead to even more confusion if we have a query with multiple limits, for example:\r\n```\r\nSELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM birth_names WHERE gender LIKE 'boy' LIMIT 10)\r\nUNION ALL\r\nSELECT * FROM birth_names WHERE gender LIKE 'girl' LIMIT 5\r\n```\r\n\r\nDoes the user know that only the `5` will be fetched with regex? This should return 15 rows but instead it only returns 5 because of how the limit is applied. And then what if I apply a `LimitControl` limit on top of that?\r\n\r\n(As an aside, for the query: \r\n```\r\nSELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM birth_names WHERE gender LIKE 'boy' LIMIT 10)\r\nUNION ALL\r\nSELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM birth_names WHERE gender LIKE 'girl' LIMIT 5)\r\n```\r\nNeither of these limits are fetched with the regex.)\r\n\r\nI think whichever route we do end up going with, the `LimitControl` field's limit should be applied as a wrap.\r\n\r\nLet me know if I'm misunderstanding how implementation of limiting (in current master) works, or if there is a better way to resolve this conflict that makes more sense.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/394854454/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/394899327","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/5136#issuecomment-394899327","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/5136","id":394899327,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NDg5OTMyNw==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-06T00:10:11Z","updated_at":"2018-06-06T00:10:11Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"LGTM","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/394899327/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/394903656","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/5126#issuecomment-394903656","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/5126","id":394903656,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NDkwMzY1Ng==","user":{"login":"williaster","id":4496521,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0OTY1MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4496521?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster","html_url":"https://github.com/williaster","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-06T00:39:04Z","updated_at":"2018-06-06T00:39:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@graceguo-supercat as we discussed this turned into a monster PR that addressed many issues, including some with the v1<>v2 switch.
