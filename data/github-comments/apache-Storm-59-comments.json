This results in a blow up with the above mentioned Exception and the worker dies.</p>\n\n<p>=== Here comes the interesting part...<br/>\nSup 5) While Worker 6703 is dying on its own, thinks that it timed out and tries to shut it down.  It realized its dead citing it might have been killed already since the process ID doesn't exist and then re-launches worker 6703.<br/>\n... about 7 seconds later ...<br/>\nSup 5) Shuts down Worker 6703 cause its :disallowed - meaning that in nimbus managed to also figure out there were missing executor heartbeats and decided to reassign them.</p>\n\n<p>=== And here's the weird part<br/>\nSup 5) while killing worker 6703 because of its :disallowed state says that the executors are <span class=\"error\">&#91;-1 -1&#93;</span>:<br/>\n2015-02-04 23:35:28 b.s.d.supervisor <span class=\"error\">&#91;INFO&#93;</span> Shutting down and clearing state for id 5f4e354c-3927-4304-ae5a-262952711001.
