As part of the 0.10 transition for us, we told everyone that they had to recompile against the newer 0.10 version of storm, and gave out explicit instructions including the exact version of the storm dependencies that were in 0.9.x.  That way they could have a jar that would work on both 0.9.x and on 0.10.  Typically it involved asking them to run <tt>mvn dependency:tree</tt> and save it off to a file, then update the version of storm they were compiling against to be 0.10.x and rerun <tt>mvn dependency:tree</tt>.  We then had them compare the version of their dependencies and make them match the original one.</p>\n\n<p>In this case it is different because they are trying to use a class that is intended to be private to storm.  I would ask them to first pick a version of guava that they want to depend on, because it is shaded in 0.9.6 they can pick just about any one that they want, add it to their pom.xml as a dependency (that is not provided), change their imports of the guava code to point to the proper location, and then recompile/package.  The new jar should work on 0.9.6 and 0.10, and if you use the hack remapping it will work on 1.0 too.  If you want to try and port the hack back to 0.10 you can, but I really want it yelling at them if they use one of our shaded dependencies.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612883909/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/196316194","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1044#issuecomment-196316194","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1044","id":196316194,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5NjMxNjE5NA==","user":{"login":"dossett","id":7207582,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyMDc1ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7207582?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett","html_url":"https://github.com/dossett","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-14T13:44:56Z","updated_at":"2016-03-14T13:44:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @arunmahadevan and @harshach.

When running <tt>storm sql</tt> we would add everything in that directory to the classpath. Additionally in <tt>StormSqlImpl.packageTopology</tt> instead of just dumping out the generated code we would also walk all of the jars in sql-lib and package them with it too.  This also opens up the possibility of having UDFs because we could add the UDF jar to the classpath and to the newly packaged topology jar.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612884340/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
