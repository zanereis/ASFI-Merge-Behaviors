Yes, the order is Cluster -> Nodes -> Namespace -> Departments -> Services -> Containers(image) -> Pods\r\n2. My idea is the `Cluster` panel show the global info, from Cluster to Pods, used for quick monitor, and the Cluster metric which scraped can't provide more details. So I'm working on another panel `Node` that will be add as the second panel, the  `Node` defined as the Cluster's instance, it is related to Cluster and can be selected to show more details. These metrics are scraped from the other collector but separated by nodes.\r\n3. I just put them in the same level and group, and the order is the count of the entity -> the status of the entity.\r\n@wu-sheng

for report this bug, by looking at the source code of different versions, it was found that their processing logic did have a certain change, which may caused the problem. other words, our `kafka-scenario` test not covered this. \r\n\r\nIt is recommended to use another way to fix it, judge whether callback is empty in `CallbackConstructorInterceptor`, like this\r\n```\r\npublic class CallbackConstructorInterceptor implements InstanceConstructorInterceptor {\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void onConstruct(EnhancedInstance objInst, Object[] allArguments) {\r\n        Callback callback = (Callback) allArguments[0];\r\n        if (null == callback) {\r\n            CallbackCache cache;\r\n            if (null != objInst.getSkyWalkingDynamicField()) {\r\n                cache = (CallbackCache) objInst.getSkyWalkingDynamicField();\r\n            } else {\r\n                cache = new CallbackCache();\r\n            }\r\n            cache.setCallback(callback);\r\n            objInst.setSkyWalkingDynamicField(cache);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\nI noticed that a similar judgment was made in kafka-client, like\r\n```\r\n    private static class InterceptorCallback<K, V> implements Callback {\r\n        private final Callback userCallback;\r\n        private final ProducerInterceptors<K, V> interceptors;\r\n        private final TopicPartition tp;\r\n\r\n        private InterceptorCallback(Callback userCallback, ProducerInterceptors<K, V> interceptors, TopicPartition tp) {\r\n            this.userCallback = userCallback;\r\n            this.interceptors = interceptors;\r\n            this.tp = tp;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public void onCompletion(RecordMetadata metadata, Exception exception) {\r\n            metadata = metadata != null ? metadata : new RecordMetadata(this.tp, -1L, -1L, -1L, -1L, -1, -1);\r\n            this.interceptors.onAcknowledgement(metadata, exception);\r\n            if (this.userCallback != null) {\r\n                this.userCallback.onCompletion(metadata, exception);\r\n            }\r\n\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nIs it convenient for you to improve the test content in `kafka-scenario`?

Is it convenient for you to improve the test content in kafka-scenario? \r\n\r\nI will have a try to improve kafka-scenario after I fix this bug.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think that you mean `null != callback` by writing `null == callback`:\r\n```Java\r\npublic class CallbackConstructorInterceptor implements InstanceConstructorInterceptor {\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void onConstruct(EnhancedInstance objInst, Object[] allArguments) {\r\n        Callback callback = (Callback) allArguments[0];\r\n        if (null == callback) {\r\n            CallbackCache cache;\r\n            if (null != objInst.getSkyWalkingDynamicField()) {\r\n                cache = (CallbackCache) objInst.getSkyWalkingDynamicField();\r\n            } else {\r\n                cache = new CallbackCache();\r\n            }\r\n            cache.setCallback(callback);\r\n            objInst.setSkyWalkingDynamicField(cache);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd I think that we should add a null check for `ContextManager.activeSpan()` in `CallbackInterceptor.handleMethodException`:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Override\r\npublic void handleMethodException(EnhancedInstance objInst, Method method, Object[] allArguments,\r\n    Class<?>[] argumentsTypes, Throwable t) {\r\n    ContextManager.activeSpan().log(t);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n@zifeihan
