It seems to be much better than the last version, so thank you for the update.\r\n\r\nOverall, I think it is still incorrect on a few points and is quite a bit longer than it will need to be in the end. The main confusion seems to be where the table location comes from. Iceberg [table metadata tracks a location](https://iceberg.apache.org/spec/#table-metadata-fields) string that is written into all metadata.json files. This is the table's location. Iceberg does not require any location other than this one and there isn't a way to pass a different location in the `TableOperations` API; the only way to pass a table location is through `TableMetadata`.\r\n\r\nThere are also a few of table properties that can affect locations:\r\n* Metadata can be redirected by setting `write.metadata.path`, which is defaulted to the `metadata` folder under the table location\r\n* The default location provider writes data underneath `write.folder-storage.path`, which is defaulted to the `data` folder under the table location\r\n* The object storage location provider shards data underneath `write.object-storage.path`\r\n\r\nThere are two broad classes of tables:\r\n1. Hadoop tables identify the table itself by location and enforce that the location in `TableMetadata` is identical to the location used to identify the table when it is created. For Hadoop tables, it makes sense that the table location used for relative paths is the location that gets passed to create [`HadoopTableOperations`](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/hadoop/HadoopTableOperations.java#L71). But then there could be a problem that table metadata actually points to a different location unless it is modified.\r\n2. Metastore tables do not have a location that is external to table metadata. However, when a metastore table is tracked by Hive, there is a location that Hive tracks and we set that to the table's location.\r\n\r\nFor table metadata files, there is only an external location for Hadoop tables. Otherwise, the table location must come from the table's metadata.json file. That makes it difficult to make `metadata_location` and `previous_metadata_location` relative paths. I would probably not attempt to make these paths relative, but I'm open to ideas.\r\n\r\nWe could update the spec to allow relative metadata.json paths for Hadoop tables, but will need to state how to handle a different `location` in the metadata file. (Ignore?)\r\n\r\nMetadata locations aside, I think that it is a good plan to make the relative paths transparent. Most of the library should continue to operate on absolute paths and relative paths should be made while writing and made absolute while reading. That makes it so the changes are fairly easily tested. If you do this, then I think there is a lot less to cover in the design doc.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/868901758/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/868901836","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/1617#issuecomment-868901836","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1617","id":868901836,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2ODkwMTgzNg==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-26T01:13:01Z","updated_at":"2021-06-26T01:13:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@flyrain and @anuragmantri, see my comment above.

The contract for name-based methods is to match name exactly. Without a proposal for changing to case insensitive, I don't think this is a good idea. I'm going to close this PR. If you'd like to pursue this, I recommend creating a case insensitive record implementation or discussing what the behavior should be in a wider context. Simply changing the behavior is not a good idea.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/869867090/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/869874709","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2694#issuecomment-869874709","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2694","id":869874709,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2OTg3NDcwOQ==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-28T17:30:51Z","updated_at":"2021-06-28T17:30:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@SreeramGarlapati FYI.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/869874709/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/869880358","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/1617#issuecomment-869880358","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1617","id":869880358,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2OTg4MDM1OA==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-28T17:37:40Z","updated_at":"2021-06-28T17:37:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@pvary, we can explore that, but it is fairly easy to write a new metadata file and use that for a table.

The main reason is that future Iceberg V2 format supports deletes, which is a concept applicable to Iceberg (not the raw file formats like Orc, Parquet etc.).
