@BasPH  - this code was vendorised and I think there were already changes implemented that make it difficult to upgrade to a newer version (which I imagine might be reason why we want to minimise the changes). So I see no big problem in updating the code again - but maybe we should split those changes to separate commits (separate for slugify and python-v3d ) so that in case we upgrade in the future, we can re-apply vendoring by mostly cherry-picking few commits on top of new library.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/485509211/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/485537697","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5094#issuecomment-485537697","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5094","id":485537697,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NTUzNzY5Nw==","user":{"login":"feluelle","id":23282078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjgyMDc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23282078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle","html_url":"https://github.com/feluelle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-22T20:17:03Z","updated_at":"2019-04-22T20:17:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@milton0825 @feng-tao actually I didn't know that we already had #5059 in. \r\n\r\n> I am not too concerned that there will be too many buttons in the dialog UI. It is up to the user to decide whether they want to add more buttons. If the user thinks that they don't want those buttons, they simply don't register any. I would rather provide the more flexibility to the users than limit it.\r\n\r\nThanks Chao-Han. I absolutly agree. I also have thought about that feature once again and you convinced me. Please count my vote as +1 now.\r\n\r\nThe only issue I still have is the right location for those buttons. I think there could be a better dialog window for those buttons.

At least I managed to reproduce locally:\r\n\r\nI set an optional breakpoint before `self.assertEqual(len(executor.running), 0)`:\r\n```python\r\nif len(executor.running) != 0:\r\n    import ipdb\r\n    ipdb.set_trace()\r\nself.assertEqual(len(executor.running), 0)\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet this run a few times and after just a few attempts I hit the breakpoint:\r\n```bash\r\nfor n in {1..100}; do nosetests tests/executors/test_local_executor.py:LocalExecutorTest.test_execution_limited_parallelism -s; done\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor the record, at this point:\r\n\r\n- `len(executor.running)` is 1 at this point in time and `executor.running` contains `{'fail': True}`\r\n- `executor.queue.empty()` returns `True`\r\n- `executor.result_queue.get()` returns `('fail', 'failed')` (I would expect this thing to be empty because `sync()` is called which loops over the result_queue, clearing out all items...)\r\n\r\nThinking out loud: my understanding is there's a race condition where the asserts are already being called before `executor.end()` finishes. I imagine there's something iffy about multiple workers and passing around the JoinableQueue to all workers, but unsure exactly what's causing the issue. Maybe `change_state()` might not finish fast enough, and the result_queue is already empty by then, and as a result the `end()` function is finished?\r\n\r\nHope this helps so far :-)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/485977458/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/485983744","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5143#issuecomment-485983744","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5143","id":485983744,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NTk4Mzc0NA==","user":{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-23T21:34:49Z","updated_at":"2019-04-23T21:40:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"We should have a separate PR for modifying nvd3 stuff -

But since we already have the `execution_date` we can always construct the TI just like other endpoints and use whatever info is inside.\r\n\r\nWhile getting the TI fields is easy, my thinking is still more on the form of the link. The fact that we can just construct a link button right now is probly not going to look very nice when we need some other format, like when we want the download log look for our kibana log links.\r\n\r\nEDIT: (hit comment button too soon) I'm not trying to scope out this PR, I think there might be use cases that a link button is enough. If it is not trivial to create such a framework for more complex pluggable components in the dialog it makes sense to start another PR around

I woke up this morning and could not stop thinking about that one and I took a deeeeep dive. It was great idea @BasPH to make it reproducible locally, that has helped me a lot. I added a lot of logging and eventually it boiled down to cases where queue.empty() returned True where queue.qsize() returned 1.\r\n\r\nI thought I lost my mind for a while, but well ... It turned out that this this is INTENDED BEHAVIOUR of multiprocessing.Queue. See the issue https://bugs.python.org/issue23582 (resolved as \"not a bug\").\r\n\r\nI have no words for it, but well, we needed to solve it. Unfortunately simple solution does not work on MacOS (qsize() does not work on MacOS and throws NotImplemented) ... So at the end I had to do what others did in the same case - have a custom SynchronizedQueue deriving from multiprocessing.Queue and add extra synchronisation/counter to put/get methods :(\r\n\r\nI described all details in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4401 and created a PR to fix it here: https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5167\r\n\r\nSpeaking about productive morning :).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/486063506/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/486064887","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5030#issuecomment-486064887","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5030","id":486064887,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NjA2NDg4Nw==","user":{"login":"jmcarp","id":1633460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzM0NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1633460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp","html_url":"https://github.com/jmcarp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-24T04:39:46Z","updated_at":"2019-04-24T04:39:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This should be ready to go now that #5090 is finished. cc @Fokko @kaxil ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/486064887/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/486065962","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4821#issuecomment-486065962","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4821","id":486065962,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NjA2NTk2Mg==","user":{"login":"jmcarp","id":1633460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzM0NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1633460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp","html_url":"https://github.com/jmcarp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-24T04:46:13Z","updated_at":"2019-04-24T04:46:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Updated documentation to match the new CLI structure.\r\n\r\nWhat's the next step here?
