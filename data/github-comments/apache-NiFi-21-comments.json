LOCAL scope `Set` is executed on every node from onTrigger\n2. LOCAL scope `View state` result will be merged at `ComponentStateEndpointMerger`, so each node can return its own state in a single merged response\n3. LOCAL scope `Clear state` is executed on every node, then one of the successful results will be returned. If it has a mixed result of success and failure, current implementation returns success result.\n4. CLUSTER scope `Set` is usually done from onTrigger, such as ListXXX processors, and we recommend to use `on primary node` schedule strategy. So usually it's not a problem. But both DFM and developer be careful.\n5. CLUSTER scope `View state` is executed on every node, even if the same state will be returned from Zookeeper. Then `ComponentStateEndpointMerger` uses one of those results. I think this should be executed **only on the primary node**.\n6. CLUSTER scope `Clear state` is executed on every node. Updating the same resource in Zk. I think this should be executed **only on the primary node**.\n7. EXTERNAL scope `Set` happens externally, NiFi doesn't control it.\n8. EXTERNAL scope `View state` is currently executed on every node, but for Kafka, I think it should be executed on **only on the primary node**. However, there may be components which retrieves node dependent EXTERNAL state in the future. In that case, differentiator something like `@OnPrimaryNodeOnly` annotation can be added, but not required for now.\n9. EXTERNAL scope `Clear state`: same as `View state`. Should be **only on the primary node**.\n\nWhile it's working, I'm not comfortable with accessing external system like Zk or Kafka if it's unnecessary, also clearing same information from multiple nodes sounds problematic. I'd like to modify CLUSTER scope behavior as well, in addition to EXTERNAL scope, to limit those happen on primary node only, at StandardNiFiServiceFacade and DAO layers.\n\nHow do you think?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/231393086/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/231446240","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/618#issuecomment-231446240","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/618","id":231446240,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMTQ0NjI0MA==","user":{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-08T19:05:46Z","updated_at":"2016-07-08T19:05:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@olegz made a few inline comments, but otherwise, all looks good!

That wouldn't have been a good idea in the 0.x baseline because the primary node may be disconnected. But in 1.0 we would auto-elect a new primary so I am ok with it in the 1.x baseline. For external state, though, we would need some sort of indicator as to whether the state should be cleared on all nodes or only the primary node.

I am not sure we want all the Ignite client logs into the NiFi log file.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/232198797/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/232200545","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/627#issuecomment-232200545","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/627","id":232200545,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMjIwMDU0NQ==","user":{"login":"mcgilman","id":123395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzM5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman","html_url":"https://github.com/mcgilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-12T22:23:42Z","updated_at":"2016-07-12T22:23:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@scottyaslan Looks good...
