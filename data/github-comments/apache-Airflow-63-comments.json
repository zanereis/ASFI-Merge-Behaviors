Makes sense? \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/243541113/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/243543407","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1767#issuecomment-243543407","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1767","id":243543407,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MzU0MzQwNw==","user":{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-30T18:58:08Z","updated_at":"2016-08-30T18:58:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/243543407/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/243569433","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1763#issuecomment-243569433","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1763","id":243569433,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MzU2OTQzMw==","user":{"login":"jbhsieh","id":1693123,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTMxMjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1693123?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbhsieh","html_url":"https://github.com/jbhsieh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbhsieh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbhsieh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbhsieh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbhsieh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbhsieh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbhsieh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbhsieh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbhsieh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbhsieh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-30T20:27:29Z","updated_at":"2016-08-30T20:27:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@r39132 I don't believe this undoes the fix in https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/1716.

It has caused a serious regression as tasks are not being scheduled anymore in master. This has been encountered in multiple reports and several PRs try to address this, however none of them have come to a conclusive end.\n\nI do understand the need to fix the bug mentioned in this PR however I consider not scheduling tasks more important than adhering to max_active_runs. Before accepting a fix to this it should be accompanied by test evidence. At a minimum a unit test should be added that verifies tasks from running dag_runs are scheduled even if max_dag_runs has been reached.\n\nA solution might be as simple as moving _process_task_instances to above all the tests or reorder them so that the check for max_dag_runs occurs after the processing of the tasks. This however should be part of this PR and properly tested.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/245738442/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/245745553","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1716#issuecomment-245745553","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1716","id":245745553,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NTc0NTU1Mw==","user":{"login":"r39132","id":581734,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MTczNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/581734?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132","html_url":"https://github.com/r39132","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-08T21:22:25Z","updated_at":"2016-09-08T21:22:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bolkedebruin I'm okay with reverting this change. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/245745553/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/245750972","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1740#issuecomment-245750972","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1740","id":245750972,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NTc1MDk3Mg==","user":{"login":"saguziel","id":3968709,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5Njg3MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3968709?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/saguziel","html_url":"https://github.com/saguziel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saguziel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saguziel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saguziel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saguziel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saguziel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saguziel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saguziel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saguziel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saguziel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-08T21:42:55Z","updated_at":"2016-09-08T21:43:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The Travis build is actually fine, it's just flaky\nhttps://travis-ci.org/saguziel/incubator-airflow\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/245750972/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/245807075","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1782#issuecomment-245807075","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1782","id":245807075,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NTgwNzA3NQ==","user":{"login":"forevernull","id":7134102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMzQxMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7134102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/forevernull","html_url":"https://github.com/forevernull","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forevernull/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forevernull/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forevernull/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forevernull/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forevernull/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forevernull/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forevernull/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forevernull/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forevernull/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-09T03:11:58Z","updated_at":"2016-09-09T03:11:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@msumit  I have mended.
