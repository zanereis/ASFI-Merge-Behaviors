Generally those should either be combined into a single commit or in my personal preference a small, curated set of commits that make it easy to understand what happened. An example for the later case might be: 1. commit that refactors existing code, 2. commit that makes the now easy change.\r\nMy guess is that your work is mostly additive and therefore squashing to a single commit might be good. Maybe you have a better idea though how to break this up into digestible commits. Things like \"Apply spotless\" and \"Remove newline\" should be squashed by the time a PR happens.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/408252988/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/408253468","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/2209#issuecomment-408253468","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/2209","id":408253468,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwODI1MzQ2OA==","user":{"login":"aditya87","id":770739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MDczOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/770739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya87","html_url":"https://github.com/aditya87","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya87/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya87/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya87/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya87/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya87/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya87/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya87/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya87/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya87/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-26T22:23:23Z","updated_at":"2018-07-26T22:23:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@pivotal-amurmann

This gives users to choose between whether to use a default SSLContext or let Geode configure with specific settings (stores, managers, protocols and ciphers). When `ssl-user-default-sslcontext` is set a default SSLContext is used using `SSLContext.getDefault()`.\r\n\r\nSo in SocketCreator, we can chose between creating default context vs configuring with user provided settings as in:\r\n```\r\ngeode-core/src/main/java/org/apache/geode/internal/net/SocketCreator.java\r\n\r\nprivate SSLContext createAndConfigureSSLContext() throws GeneralSecurityException, IOException {\r\n\r\n    if (sslConfig.useDefaultSSLContext()) {\r\n      return SSLContext.getDefault();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    SSLContext newSSLContext = getSSLContextInstance();\r\n    KeyManager[] keyManagers = getKeyManagers();\r\n    TrustManager[] trustManagers = getTrustManagers();\r\n\r\n    newSSLContext.init(keyManagers, trustManagers, null /* use the default secure random */);\r\n    return newSSLContext;\r\n  }\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/410894247/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/410926722","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/2262#issuecomment-410926722","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/2262","id":410926722,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMDkyNjcyMg==","user":{"login":"jdeppe-pivotal","id":5313410,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMTM0MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5313410?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/jdeppe-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-07T04:06:36Z","updated_at":"2018-08-07T04:06:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm not sure if this is supposed to be ready, but I cannot run tests from a newly imported IJ project with these changes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/410926722/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/410933248","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/2262#issuecomment-410933248","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/2262","id":410933248,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMDkzMzI0OA==","user":{"login":"jake-at-work","id":6800791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MDA3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6800791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work","html_url":"https://github.com/jake-at-work","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-07T04:56:32Z","updated_at":"2018-08-07T04:56:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"There are still some test issues but limitted to a small subset.
