I have carefully read the paper from UIUC, one thing still concerns me is that the length of input queue which they claimed is a built-in metric in Storm is not that easy to retrieve. According to my observation there is no such metric in the UI daemon or any other part of Storm’s implementation. Maybe I didn’t manage to understand it correctly, but missing this critical information makes their bottleneck detection hard to reproduce in my system and thus I have to figure it out on my own, which by the way, is kind of similar to what you have proposed above and is mainly based on the capacity obtained from the monitor. Besides, in my case even the same size of input stream could potentially induce a varying resource demand, since some logic in bolts are basically depends on the type and fields of tuples. Have you guys taken this into your considerations?</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612515873/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612515878","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4435#issuecomment-2612515878","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4435","id":2612515878,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI1MTU4Nzg=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-26T10:37:09Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T13:19:54Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=memorylake@qq.com\">memorylake@qq.com</a>:</i>\n<p>It will be very helpful if we could find a way to measure the waiting time that a tuple spent in a component or at lest the length of input queue for each task so that the queuing theory could come to our rescue. As we have already known the complete latency for spout and the process latency for each bolt, I believe the missing part is how the rest of latency is distributed.

It is to ensure that I have enough capacity on \"average\" to handle the load. Others may like to optimize on overall system latency, which would have a different algorithm. This auto-scale change will be a plugin, so one can try to optimize for this case with another implementation should ultra-low latency be a concern.</p>\n\n<p>On latency, capacity and input queue depth of a bolt with respect to auto-scaling, which is different than total system measures. </p>\n\n<p>Latency is the time it take the bolt to process a Tuple. Short of a code change, or the dependent output system change (e.g. Kafka output bolt), the latency will remain constant as load changes. Given latency maximum throughput of the bolt is known, and it generally remains constant. For CPU bound bolts, provided you don't overload the system, the system will scale linearly. Similarly for a Kafka bolt, provided you don't overload Kafka.  Even when the bolt is running at 100% you can figure out the throughput. It may not be perfect, but it is fairly good for the systems I've worked with. </p>\n\n<p>Queue depth is very different and really interesting, but it is a function of many things. It is also erratic and difficult to properly measure. Generally, if the system is not overloaded, the instantaneous queue depth will be zero quite often. If the inbound load was perfectly constant, in theory, the queue depth would either be 1 or 0, never greater than 1. When the inbound load is erratic (e.g. it bursts), the queue fills up, but a bursty inbound load also has the opposite side, a low rate, and this allows the system time to drain the queue. What happens when the queue fills up? Hopefully no one builds an unbounded queue! OOM! it will either need to overflow and drop data, or apply backpressure upstream. In the last system I worked on the messaging system did not allow backpressure, and when and individual partition was running around 400K/sec we could have queue depths of 100K. But they would always return to zero, as the downstream components were able to handle the average load. As long as the queue depth fluctuates between zero and some number you have a system that is not overloaded. Even with backpressure we would still see this same pattern. This is why I find this metric difficult to work with for auto-scaling. Further, to measure queue depth, sampling the depth periodically is difficult. You would need a large number of samples to state that the queue was “at zero 2% of the time”. In my prior system, max queue depth was extremely important for me, and I instrumented the input side of the queue to record the maximum depth with each put, and reset it each sampling of the metric.</p>\n\n<p>Now some will be concerned about overall system latency, which is generally not my concern. It would only be of concern if someone said \"99% of the data is delivered in 100ms or less\". If your latency is measured in seconds, I would say throughput is the primary goal. If you don't overload, latency is generally driven by the speed of your algorithms, and bursting. If you think you have sub-sub second latencies as a requirement, then bursting, GC, backpressure and acknowledgment mechanisms will be of concern as well. </p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612515884/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612580374","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4786#issuecomment-2612580374","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4786","id":2612580374,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI1ODAzNzQ=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-27T18:36:17Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T13:51:56Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=etolmachev\">etolmachev</a>:</i>\n<p>Hi Zhuo, I'm using FsStorm (<a href=\"https://github.com/et1975/FsStorm\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/et1975/FsStorm</a>) to compose and submit a topology for execution over multilang.
