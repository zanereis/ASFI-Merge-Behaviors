When I looked through the code, I saw the section of code that was handling permissions around the Status History but didn't look close enough. I had assumed that if the user doesn't have read permissions on the processor, that the stats would be made unavailable. However, looking again, I see that what we do is allow access to the stats but just blank out the name of the Processor.\r\n\r\nWhat probably makes sense, then, is to filter out any stats that come from counters unless the user does have read permissions to the Processor. I.e., if User A has no read permissions to a processor, its stats would return just the way they are now, with just the pre-defined Bytes In, Bytes Out, FlowFiles In, FlowFiles out, etc. But if the user does have read permissions, then they will also see all stats for counters emitted by that processor (but not type-specific counters, just instance-specific counters).

In order to do so, they will define a schema that has a compound array object as the top level object. I agree with that.\r\n\r\nHowever, if an user is going to split it at downstream, they might need another schema to treat each items within the top-level array as individual record. If ConsumeKafkaRecord can do that as it consumes messages, it may be better. Ideally, I prefer ConsumeKafkaRecord to support both ways, by parsing a message as a message, or split each records in a message.\r\n\r\nI intended to support both modes in this PR. Please let me know if we have strong reason not to do so.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I did try to setup a schema in AvroSchemaRegistry as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"array\",\r\n  \"items\": {\r\n    \"type\": \"record\", \"name\": \"temp\",\r\n    \"fields\": [\r\n      {\"name\": \"value\", \"type\": \"string\"}\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile this is a valid schema in Avro, current NiFi AvroSchemaRegistry doesn't allow this as it requires the top level object to be a record.
