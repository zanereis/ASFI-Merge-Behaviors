But, that is actually the purpose.\r\n\r\nAs we know, it is *very* difficult to get memory management just right at present due to the wildly varying memory layouts for vectors, power-of-two rounding of buffer sizes, unexpected doubling of vectors, and lack of control over the size of incoming batches. We'd love to fix these, but doing so will take time.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, we have the choice of failing queries because the calcs are off by a bit, or being more flexible and letting queries succeed at the risk of running out of memory. The change here does log each \"excess\" allocation so we can find them and fix any remaining issues. Also, in a test environment, strict limits are enforced to find bugs.\r\n\r\nAll of this is set against the backdrop of the exchange operators, hash join, and other operators that have an unlimited appetite for memory. Until we reign in those operators, seems silly to kill user queries because those operators that *do* manage memory make a small mistake here or there.\r\n\r\nOnce all operators are under control, and Drill's internal memory allocation is under better control, we can back out this change and be much more strict about enforcing memory limits.\r\n\r\nBottom line: should we fail user queries because of remaining rough spots in the \"managed\" operators? Or, should we allow user queries to succeed at a very small additional risk of running out of memory?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/333347104/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/333348062","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/949#issuecomment-333348062","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/949","id":333348062,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMzM0ODA2Mg==","user":{"login":"paul-rogers","id":3248881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDg4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3248881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers","html_url":"https://github.com/paul-rogers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-01T02:02:14Z","updated_at":"2017-10-01T02:02:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Please resolve commits and rebase onto master.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/333348062/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/333352058","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/940#issuecomment-333352058","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/940","id":333352058,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMzM1MjA1OA==","user":{"login":"ilooner","id":8020165,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMjAxNjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8020165?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner","html_url":"https://github.com/ilooner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-01T04:07:44Z","updated_at":"2017-10-01T04:07:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@paul-rogers Yeah this is ready for final review and commit.

However, until planner could claim there is no issues at all ( just like what happened prior to DRILL-5546), execution still may face a columns list with \"*\". That's why in HBaseGroupScan we have verifyColumnsAndConvertStar, just in case planner's project push-down did not work in the way we want.  If as you suggested, such conversion in HBaseGroupScan is redundant, why would it cause regression (if planner's rule works as expected)? or is it your intention to still keep \"*\" in HBaseRecordReader? If that's your intention, I think we are going in the wrong direction. HBase has a unified schema at table level.  \r\n\r\nI agree that the analysis of empty map {},  vs {a:varbinary}.  It's something we have to deal with. As a matter of fact, such scenarios does not have to come from empty batch. It could happen with two regions with >0 rows.  \r\n\r\nFor instance, regrion 1 has 10 rows, with cf1.c1 appears in only first 5 rows, while region 2 has 20 rows with cf1.c1 appears in every rows. For the following query:\r\nselect CF1 FROM table where some_condition_on_row_key;\r\n\r\nif \"some_condition_on_row_key\" is pushed to hbase and prunes the first 5 rows, region1 will return a batch with 5 rows, but with cf1 as an empty map, while region2 will have map with cf1 as {c1:varbinary}.  \r\n\r\nIn that sense, DRILL-5546 exposes such issues, and force us to have a solution to handle empty map {} vs {a:varbinary}/\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/333448232/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/333472313","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/510#issuecomment-333472313","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/510","id":333472313,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMzQ3MjMxMw==","user":{"login":"vvysotskyi","id":20928429,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTI4NDI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20928429?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi","html_url":"https://github.com/vvysotskyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-02T08:33:25Z","updated_at":"2017-10-02T08:33:25Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@pmaciolek,

For HBase, that's not an issue. But it's an issue for MapRDB binary table, as it's processed as a table on a file system, in stead of following the logic of HBase in planning time. I could not comment why MapRDB binary table was handled that way. But the reality is that you still will see column star in execution for MapRDB, if we do not keep the \"redundant\" code in execution (which essentially converts * into row_key/column family). \r\n\r\nIf we keep column star in record reader's columns list, then we would end up with nullable-int vs map column. If we expand column star, then we may end up with empty map vs a non-empty map. To me, it's easier to handle the latter case. Plus it's something we have to deal with in case of HBase/JSON plugin. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/334049351/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/334050146","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/968#issuecomment-334050146","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/968","id":334050146,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNDA1MDE0Ng==","user":{"login":"paul-rogers","id":3248881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDg4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3248881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers","html_url":"https://github.com/paul-rogers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-04T04:58:57Z","updated_at":"2017-10-04T04:58:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the explanation!

The conversion must be done at the interface.\r\n\r\nOur convention is (or should be):\r\n\r\n* External names, or at least those that are not valid Drill symbols, must be quoted in SQL.\r\n* Internally, each name segment is stored as a `NamePart` object, with a collection of parts forming a `SchemaPath`.\r\n* When calling back out to the external system, the interface (plugin) must convert from Drill format back out to the external system format.\r\n\r\nNow, let's consider this change. In Drill code, we call Drill methods to convert Drill names to MapR DB format. While this just might work, it does not really follow the above rules.\r\n\r\nWhat we want is a `String drillToMapRDName(SchemaPath path)` method that applies DB-specific rules for conversion at the point of calls into DB. All names within Drill (unless cached only in the DB storage plugin) must be in Drill's internal form.\r\n\r\nThis point would not be that important if Drill worked with just one external system (DB in this case). But, as Drill evolves, it must work with a variety of systems. We should not rely on methods on Drill classes to provide the proper name format for external systems: external systems must provide those rules. This is true even if it happens to work out, for now, that Drill's current methods happen to work.\r\n\r\nJust to drive the point home. Here we are changing a Drill method to produce names in a format that DB needs. But, might some other external system interface depend on the old format? How will this converge?\r\n\r\nBottom line:\r\n\r\nDo the conversion in DB-specific code and will work fine.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/334657116/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/334708858","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/928#issuecomment-334708858","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/928","id":334708858,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNDcwODg1OA==","user":{"login":"arina-ielchiieva","id":15086720,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDg2NzIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15086720?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva","html_url":"https://github.com/arina-ielchiieva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-06T09:43:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-06T09:43:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@paul-rogers

Since the string, that is received in the method `JsonConditionBuilder.createJsonScanSpec()` from `SchemaPath` instance will be parsed using `org.ojai.FieldPath.parseFrom()` method, to avoid any ambiguousness, I converted `SchemaPath` to `FieldPath` and then called `FieldPath.asPathString()`.

Thanks for the detailed explanation!\r\n\r\nBefore reviewing the code, a comment on the design:\r\n\r\n> Added a new integer variable \"asciiMode\" ... this value will be set ... during the first LIKE evaluation and will be reused across other LIKE evaluations\r\n\r\nThe problem with this design is that there is no guarantee that the first value is representative of the other columns. Maybe my list looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nHello\r\n你好\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first value is ASCII. The second is not. So, we must treat each value as independent of the others.\r\n\r\nOr, maybe the design means that we do this per holder per row. In this case, do we know that the holder is reused for accesses to the same column in the same row, but is reinitialized for each new row? We'd have to look at the generated code (see the \"Plain Java\" feature) to see how this works.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we *can* exploit the nature of UTF-8. The encoding is such that no valid UTF-8 character is a prefix of any other valid character. Thus, if a character is 0xXX 0xYY 0xZZ, then there can *never* be a valid character which is 0xXX 0xYY. As a result, starts-with, ends-width, equals and contains can be done without either converting to UTF-16 or even caring if the data is ASCII or not.\r\n\r\nWhat does this mean? It means that, for the simple operations:\r\n\r\n1. Convert the Java UTF-16 string to UTF-8.\r\n2. Do the classic byte comparison methods for starts with, ends with or contains. No special processing is needed for multi-byte\r\n\r\nUnlike other multi-byte encodings, UTF-8 was designed to make this possible.\r\n\r\nIf we go this route, we would not need the ASCII mode flag.\r\n\r\nNote: all of this applies only to the \"basic four\" operations: if we do a real regex, then we must decode the Varchar into a Java UTF-16 string.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/337762453/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/337762992","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1001#issuecomment-337762992","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1001","id":337762992,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzc2Mjk5Mg==","user":{"login":"sachouche","id":29960235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTYwMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29960235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachouche","html_url":"https://github.com/sachouche","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachouche/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachouche/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachouche/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachouche/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachouche/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachouche/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachouche/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachouche/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachouche/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-19T00:11:49Z","updated_at":"2017-10-19T00:11:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"- It was 50% for 1) and 50% for 2)\r\n- Notice this breakdown depends on \r\n   o The number of Contains pattern for the same value (impacts 1))\r\n   o The pattern length (impacts both 1) and 2))  ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/337762992/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/337764152","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1001#issuecomment-337764152","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1001","id":337764152,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzc2NDE1Mg==","user":{"login":"sachouche","id":29960235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTYwMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29960235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachouche","html_url":"https://github.com/sachouche","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachouche/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachouche/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachouche/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachouche/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachouche/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachouche/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachouche/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachouche/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachouche/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-19T00:20:33Z","updated_at":"2017-10-19T00:21:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Paul,\r\n\r\n- I think you misunderstood the proposal\r\n- Let me use an example\r\n- select .. c1 like '%pattern1%' OR c1 like '%pattern2%'..\r\n- Assume c1 has 3 values [v1, v2, v3]\r\n- The generated code will create a new VarcharHolder instance for each value iteration\r\n- For v1: VarCharHolder vc1 is created, ascii-mode computed for pattern1, ascii-mode computation reused for pattern2, pattern3, etc since we're evaluating the same value\r\n- For v2: VarCharHolder vc2 is created, ascii-mode computed for pattern1, ascii-mode computation reused for pattern2, pattern3, etc since we're evaluating the same value\r\n- DITO for v3\r\n\r\nNote that the test-suite has similar test cases that you are proposing; they all passed.
