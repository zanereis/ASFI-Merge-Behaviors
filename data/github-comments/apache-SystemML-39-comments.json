I just checked out the branch to debug it a little bit, but there are still a number of compilation issues. Overall, I think you make your life too hard by trying to cover part 2 and part 3 all in one step. I would recommend to focus only on part 2 for now, start with one or two basic tests, and modify the language layer and hop/lop compilation accordingly. Also, you might want to set the `FunctionOp._singleOutFun` only if required, i.e., when a function is actually used inside an expression. This would guarantee that you don't affect any other functions or existing scripts, you can focus on your new tests, and there is almost no risk pushing this PR via separate parts into master.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/335381100/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/335571721","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/679#issuecomment-335571721","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/679","id":335571721,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNTU3MTcyMQ==","user":{"login":"niketanpansare","id":11686380,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjg2Mzgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11686380?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare","html_url":"https://github.com/niketanpansare","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-10T18:51:11Z","updated_at":"2017-10-10T18:51:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@nakul02

In general, it makes sense to be able to use the previous layer's output shape for the next layer's input shape (and the functions in `nn` do that), so it should be fine to do it here as well.  The bigger issue for me though is that I don't think hacks like this should be necessary.  The shapes *can* (assuming the engine worked well....) all be computed at compile time, and thus the shape variables that are returned from every function in `nn` *should* be able to be reliably used, without any unknown values.

First, during (basic) dynamic recompilation we have an unconditional compilation scope of a single DAG, so unless there are data-dependent operators such as table, rand(sum(X),1), etc all dimension sizes become known. I would recommend to look at operators like DataGenOp and adapt the same approach. Also note that IPA for size propagation across functions simply reuses the dynamic recompilation infrastructure. So once the size propagation of the ConvolutionOp is fixed, it would implicitly remove the need for dynamic recompilation altogether. Second, I think the ConvolutionOp does also not correctly mark operators for dynamic recompilation. Normally, we mark operators for dynamic recompilation if the exec type is spark (potentially due to unknowns) and dimensions/sparsity is unknown or in forced cp exec type if the dimensiosn are unknown. Neither applies here, because the ConvolutionOp does not support spark operations.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/337105850/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/337109142","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/685#issuecomment-337109142","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/685","id":337109142,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzEwOTE0Mg==","user":{"login":"niketanpansare","id":11686380,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjg2Mzgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11686380?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare","html_url":"https://github.com/niketanpansare","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-17T03:43:25Z","updated_at":"2017-10-17T03:43:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mboehm7 There are 2 issues here:\r\n1.

The values in the cell denotes time in seconds for 100 iteration of corresponding matrix multiplication for `CP`, `GPU this PR`, `GPU master`. It shows that for low sparsity, cusparse outperforms cublas in almost all cases but in moderate sparsity, there are cases where converting to dense and performing cublas matrix multiplication helps.
