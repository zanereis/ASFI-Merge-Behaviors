, I think your point is valid, but sometimes the log file is very hard to render and view if the file is too large(not sure of the status or the implementation detail for #3992). The log file is very critical for debugging production issue on why the task not running. And adding this action provides to task instance UI panel(all the operations for task instance) provides a way to download the file based on different try number. Hence I think this pr provides value on solving this issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/451364978/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/451366052","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4425#issuecomment-451366052","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4425","id":451366052,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MTM2NjA1Mg==","user":{"login":"pingzh","id":8662365,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NjIzNjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8662365?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pingzh","html_url":"https://github.com/pingzh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pingzh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pingzh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pingzh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pingzh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pingzh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pingzh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pingzh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pingzh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pingzh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-04T06:55:43Z","updated_at":"2019-01-04T06:55:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@msumit Thanks for the info.
