With this I can split a source by its partition count by default and each partition will be a split. This is how Samza itself works today by default, so it's consistent with the current model.

I think that the way it works it that the source itself will split into the default number. Dataflow used to do this during translation, which was not a great thing. Now splittable DoFn makes it necessary to do it dynamically.\n\n---\n\n\n*Comments from [Reviewable](https://reviewable.io:443/reviews/apache/beam/4340)*\n<!-- Sent from Reviewable.io -->\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/358754766/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/358757526","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/4420#issuecomment-358757526","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4420","id":358757526,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1ODc1NzUyNg==","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-18T19:35:38Z","updated_at":"2018-01-18T19:35:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"LGTM.

The source can try to obey or return any number splits that makes sense for the source. Runner decides how to map those splits into its internal processing parallelism. In that sense does 'maxSourceParallism' directly influence 'desiredNumSplits'?\n\nHow it works in : Streaming applications in Dataflow: Its 'desiredNumSplits' is based on max number of cores the jobs is configured (due to autoscaling, actually number of cores might be fewer). If the source returns more splits than suggested, I think Dataflow tries to run all of the splits in parallel (need to check if there is a limit).\n\n---\n\n\n*Comments from

So go ahead and merge when ready, but maybe take it further afterwards.\r\n\r\nDo you really want cancelation by either end to be the same method? I guess it seems like the new class has a similar problem to `CompletableFuture` that it exists in a liminal space between the interfaces intended for the consumer and producer of the data. It is (mis-)named and documented like it is for the consumer, but its API is for the producer. I think we are in territory addressed by this SO answer: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14541975/difference-between-future-and-promise](https://stackoverflow.com/a/28821051/949327)\r\n\r\n\"a future is a read-only container for a result that does not yet exist, while a promise can be written (normally only once). The Java 8 CompletableFuture and the Guava SettableFuture can be thought of as promises, because their value can be set (\"completed\"), but they also implement the Future interface, therefore there is no difference for the client.\"\r\n\r\nThere's lots of other guidance like \"In Scala a Future object is created by an asynchronous computation or by a different Promise object. In C++ the situation is similar: the promise object is used by the producer and the future object by the consumer.\" and \"\\[`CompletableFuture`'s\\] most useful feature is the unrelated chaining of processing steps.\"","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/359008465/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/359010082","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/4445#issuecomment-359010082","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4445","id":359010082,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1OTAxMDA4Mg==","user":{"login":"herohde","id":14226387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjI2Mzg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14226387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/herohde","html_url":"https://github.com/herohde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herohde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herohde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herohde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herohde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herohde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herohde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herohde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herohde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herohde/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-19T16:05:55Z","updated_at":"2018-01-19T16:05:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/359010082/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/359014825","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/4447#issuecomment-359014825","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4447","id":359014825,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1OTAxNDgyNQ==","user":{"login":"herohde","id":14226387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjI2Mzg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14226387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/herohde","html_url":"https://github.com/herohde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herohde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herohde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herohde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herohde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herohde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herohde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herohde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herohde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/herohde/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-19T16:20:40Z","updated_at":"2018-01-19T16:20:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM

I don't know how to fix that yet so I propose to stick to the fixed-size queue with capacity enough for 1 or 2 shards. That solution is safe and only performance could be affected. We could come back to improving the performance if anyone complains. What do you think @jkff?\r\n\r\nIn fact, adjusting the queue size to the number of shards was just my assumption for scaling the performance. Actually the number of records is one of two factors that should be taken into consideration. The other one is the average record size.

much?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/359083896/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/359104921","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/4450#issuecomment-359104921","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4450","id":359104921,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1OTEwNDkyMQ==","user":{"login":"robertwb","id":486017,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjAxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/486017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb","html_url":"https://github.com/robertwb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-19T22:17:11Z","updated_at":"2018-01-19T22:17:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"R:
