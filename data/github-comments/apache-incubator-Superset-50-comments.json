John Omernik started working on this, but his dialect used Drill’s ODBC interface.  I’ve had a lot of issues getting Drill to work with ODBC so I decided to use pydrill which uses the RESTful interface and hence no additional drivers to configure.  However, PyDrill isn’t DBAPI compliant, so I first had to build that… This was way more complicated than I first imagined, but I’m learning a lot so it’s fun. \nThanks for the tip and I’ll probably have other questions as I go forward.  \nBest,\n— C\n\n\n\n\n> On Jan 7, 2017, at 00:54, Maxime Beauchemin <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n> \n> Nice! a dbapi and sqlalchemy support are great assets for the Apache Drill community.

very cool. My only feedback here would still be: is there a way to expose both the log data (potentially flattening some of the properties stored in the JSON, projecting them as easily-queryable values) and the slice / dashboard metadata in a more accessible way for querying, so that you enable admins to ask _any_ general questions of that data.\r\n\r\nAgain, I like the idea of your network viz for your use case, but I'm imaging admins asking _many_ arbitrary questions about their instance, and your viz might not target all of them.\r\n\r\nMaybe this is a separate story from yours - just wanted to put
