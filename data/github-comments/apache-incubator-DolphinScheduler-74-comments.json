存在时使用该池.\r\n2.Use the pool root..[username] only if the pool and root. both exists.(下拉项中的池名称是hdfs，root.hdfs是作为父池)\r\n3.使用池 root. 。\r\n  日规则始终满足。不会使用后续规则。**\r\n\r\nDS里租户编码跟租户名称一样，队列名称与队列值是一样。我在DS里设置了**root.hdfs.mapreduce，root.hdfs.spark，root.hdfs.flink这三个队列**，所有的租户、用户关联的队列都是这三个之一。在yarn的资源池里设置了6个不同的资源池，包括了DS的一样的队列root.hdfs.mapreduce、root.hdfs.spark、root.hdfs.flink，还包括了三个不同的root.hdfs.DS租户编码。结果yarn日志里显示的队列还是root.hdfs.DS租户编码。\r\n![ds租户管理](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68679394/95824256-9227c200-0d61-11eb-9d15-52a01c874add.jpg)\r\n![yarn资源池放置规则1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68679394/95824266-96ec7600-0d61-11eb-8acc-0b96bba7c5ca.jpg)\r\n![yarn资源池放置规则](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68679394/95824272-99e76680-0d61-11eb-87da-74edc4afc51e.jpg)\r\n![所有资源池](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68679394/95824278-9ce25700-0d61-11eb-98f9-c418040b0db1.jpg)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/707519042/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/707585456","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/3897#issuecomment-707585456","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/3897","id":707585456,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwNzU4NTQ1Ng==","user":{"login":"xingchun-chen","id":55787491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1Nzg3NDkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55787491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingchun-chen","html_url":"https://github.com/xingchun-chen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingchun-chen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingchun-chen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingchun-chen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingchun-chen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingchun-chen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingchun-chen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingchun-chen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingchun-chen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingchun-chen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-13T08:35:06Z","updated_at":"2020-10-13T08:35:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"please
