It is just a State, there are no get operations supported on it, it is a sink that writes all input to HDFS.  The issue is with others reading the data.  The readers in this case are likely to be a batch job using a Hadoop input format to read the data.  For regular storm it provides at most once or at least once semantics, and the HdfsBolt, which is also a sink, provides the exact same semantics, so if there is duplicate data or lost data it could be for more reasons then just the Bolt not syncing things correctly.  In that case however, I would like to see the spout not ack a tuple until it has been synced to disk, that way we truly can be sure no data is lost, but that is another issue.</p>\n\n<p>for trident we expect exactly once semantics, especially form something that comes as an official part of storm.  The File formats that the data is written out in are just a log with no ability to overwrite out of data data like a MapState can.

By doing this, the synchronization that was involved in the deadlock can be removed altogether.</p>\n\n<p>    My reasoning is as follows:</p>\n<ul class=\"alternate\" type=\"square\">\n\t<li>One has three option to deal with Netty's buffer filling up:<br/>\n      1. Discard incoming new messages<br/>\n      2. Block client thread until there is space (back pressure)<br/>\n      3. Keep buffering up until OOME is thrown</li>\n\t<li>My guess is that the `v0.9.4` code attempted to implement option <img class=\"emoticon\" src=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/information.png\" height=\"16\" width=\"16\" align=\"absmiddle\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"/>, but actually the behavior is option (iii). When Netty's `Channel.isWritable` returns false in `Client.send`, the thread avoids writing to the `Channel` and leaves messages in the `Channel.messageBatch` field, which the background task flushes when the `Channel.isWritable` starts to return true again. However, if `Client.send` is called again before this (which should be common), the content of `Channel.messageBatch` is written and buffered on the `Channel` anyways, because `flushMessages` does not check `Channel.isWritable`.</li>\n\t<li>AFAIU we like option (ii), but this requires more work. Between option <img class=\"emoticon\" src=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/information.png\" height=\"16\" width=\"16\" align=\"absmiddle\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"/> and option (iii), IMO (iii) is superior because if OOME happens, the user can reduce MAX_PENDING_TUPLES to prevent this. Discarding messages would be harder to diagnose.</li>\n\t<li>If we are content with option (ii), we can remove the background flushing task and related synchronization altogether, removing the source of deadlock.

Netty's Channel queues up written data on an unbounded buffer. The background flushing seems to have been added to avoid this, but in practice it was probably doing it anyways because flushMessages(), which is called by send() doesn't check for isWritable. Moreover, queuing on an unbounded buffer seems fine because back pressure is provided by MAX_PENDING_TUPLE. If OOME occurs due to this buffer overflowing, it seems reasonable that one has to reduce MAX_PENDING_TUPLE, rather than Storm trying to cope with it by dropping messages.</p>\n\n<p>commit

Deadlock hazard in backtype.storm.messaging.netty.Client</p>\n\n<p>    (I accidentally did a PR against master with the same content, please ignore that one)</p>\n\n<p>    This fixes the reported deadlock between `disruptor-worker-transfer-queue` thread and `client-worker` thread, which seem to have been introduced by <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-329\" title=\"Fix cascading Storm failure by improving reconnection strategy and buffering messages\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"STORM-329\"><del>STORM-329</del></a>.</p>\n\n<p>    After reviewing the `v0.9.4` code, my conclusion was that the background flushing task can be removed without real change in the behavior. By doing this, the synchronization that was involved in the deadlock can be removed altogether.</p>\n\n<p>    My reasoning is as follows:</p>\n<ul class=\"alternate\" type=\"square\">\n\t<li>One has three option to deal with Netty's buffer filling up:<br/>\n      1. Discard incoming new messages<br/>\n      2. Block client thread until there is space (back pressure)<br/>\n      3. Keep buffering up until OOME is thrown</li>\n\t<li>My guess is that the `v0.9.4` code attempted to implement option <img class=\"emoticon\" src=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/information.png\" height=\"16\" width=\"16\" align=\"absmiddle\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"/>, but actually the behavior is option (iii). When Netty's `Channel.isWritable` returns false in `Client.send`, the thread avoids writing to the `Channel` and leaves messages in the `Channel.messageBatch` field, which the background task flushes when the `Channel.isWritable` starts to return true again. However, if `Client.send` is called again before this (which should be common), the content of `Channel.messageBatch` is written and buffered on the `Channel` anyways, because `flushMessages` does not check `Channel.isWritable`.</li>\n\t<li>AFAIU we like option (ii), but this requires more work. Between option <img class=\"emoticon\" src=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/information.png\" height=\"16\" width=\"16\" align=\"absmiddle\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"/> and option (iii), IMO (iii) is superior because if OOME happens, the user can reduce MAX_PENDING_TUPLES to prevent this. Discarding messages would be harder to diagnose.</li>\n\t<li>If we are content with option (ii), we can remove the background flushing task and related synchronization altogether, removing the source of deadlock. We'd simply write and buffer onto the unbounded buffer of `Channel`, and if there are too many pending messages, the worker will die of OOME, and the user should reduce this with indirect means like reducing MAX_PENDING_TUPLES until option (ii) is implemented in the future.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>    Thoughts @miguno ?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:</p>\n\n<p>    $ git pull <a href=\"https://github.com/eshioji/storm\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/eshioji/storm</a> <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-839\" title=\"Deadlock hazard in backtype.storm.messaging.netty.Client\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"STORM-839\"><del>STORM-839</del></a></p>\n\n<p>Alternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/566.patch\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/566.patch</a></p>\n\n<p>To close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch<br/>\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:</p>\n\n<p>    This closes #566</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>commit ed8ab3ec194f19c75fc2f5c000609204f04b50e8<br/>\nAuthor: Enno Shioji <eshioji@gmail.com><br/>\nDate:   2015-05-28T19:42:05Z</p>\n\n<p>    Simplified the flow and removed the lock that was causing the deadlock</p>\n\n<p>commit 91b8eb3840432e47b79f40abebec8304627732a8<br/>\nAuthor: Enno Shioji <eshioji@gmail.com><br/>\nDate:   2015-05-28T19:46:17Z</p>\n\n<p>    Bump version</p>\n\n<p>commit b7d84bdc7fd3de34f45a94131cdbb6bfbd3763dc<br/>\nAuthor: Enno Shioji <eshioji@gmail.com><br/>\nDate:   2015-05-28T21:27:31Z</p>\n\n<p>    Remove background flushing because it doesn't seem necessary. Netty's Channel queues up written data on an unbounded buffer. The background flushing seems to have been added to avoid this, but in practice it was probably doing it anyways because flushMessages(), which is called by send() doesn't check for isWritable. Moreover, queuing on an unbounded buffer seems fine because back pressure is provided by MAX_PENDING_TUPLE. If OOME occurs due to this buffer overflowing, it seems reasonable that one has to reduce MAX_PENDING_TUPLE, rather than Storm trying to cope with it by dropping messages.</p>\n\n<p>commit 679e42bc1e38f51c2759667b03cb45322c6a793b<br/>\nAuthor: Enno Shioji <eshioji@gmail.com><br/>\nDate:   2015-05-28T21:31:35Z</p>\n\n<p>    Change to a SNAPSHOT version for deployment purposes</p>\n\n<p>commit 27a92e2aa3488c0203f500306e0583ff9e7e1e82<br/>\nAuthor: Enno Shioji <eshioji@gmail.com><br/>\nDate:   2015-05-29T09:32:16Z</p>\n\n<p>    Remove (now) dead comment and code</p>\n\n<p>commit 09bf6e1b5d9d351f2a60cd9a32e0239752cf437a<br/>\nAuthor: Enno Shioji <eshioji@gmail.com><br/>\nDate:   2015-05-29T10:23:46Z</p>\n\n<p>    Merge branch '0.9.x-branch' into <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-839\" title=\"Deadlock hazard in backtype.storm.messaging.netty.Client\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"STORM-839\"><del>STORM-839</del></a></p>\n\n<p>    Conflicts:<br/>\n    \texamples/storm-starter/pom.xml<br/>\n    \texternal/storm-hbase/pom.xml<br/>\n    \texternal/storm-hdfs/pom.xml<br/>\n    \texternal/storm-kafka/pom.xml<br/>\n    \tpom.xml<br/>\n    \tstorm-buildtools/maven-shade-clojure-transformer/pom.xml<br/>\n    \tstorm-core/pom.xml<br/>\n    \tstorm-dist/binary/pom.xml<br/>\n    \tstorm-dist/source/pom.xml</p>\n\n<hr />","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612560904/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/106768270","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/566#issuecomment-106768270","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/566","id":106768270,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwNjc2ODI3MA==","user":{"login":"eshioji","id":1995924,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTU5MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1995924?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eshioji","html_url":"https://github.com/eshioji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eshioji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eshioji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eshioji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eshioji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eshioji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eshioji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eshioji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eshioji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eshioji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-29T10:35:23Z","updated_at":"2015-05-29T10:35:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Hailei Thanks for the comment.
