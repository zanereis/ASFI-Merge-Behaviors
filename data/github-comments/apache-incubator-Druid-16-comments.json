One of the configurations is auto.offset.reset. According to the Kafka docs for this config:\n\nWhat to do when there is no initial offset in Zookeeper or if an offset is out of range:\n- smallest : automatically reset the offset to the smallest offset\n- largest : automatically reset the offset to the largest offset\n- anything else: throw exception to the consumer. If this is set to largest, the consumer may lose some messages when the number of partitions, for the topics it subscribes to, changes on the broker. To prevent data loss during partition addition, set auto.offset.reset to smallest\n\nGiven that Kafka has no real notion of timestamps, Druid has no way of reading messages from exactly at the beginning of an hour. The firehose needs to start at some offset in Kafka, and in this case, it started reading messages from an offset corresponding to events that were ingested at around the time the node started up. I agree we should do a better job of documenting this possibility.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/81855547/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/81856465","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/1202#issuecomment-81856465","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1202","id":81856465,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxODU2NDY1","user":{"login":"pdeva","id":3190176,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxOTAxNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3190176?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdeva","html_url":"https://github.com/pdeva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdeva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdeva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdeva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdeva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdeva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdeva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdeva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdeva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdeva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-16T18:31:25Z","updated_at":"2015-03-16T18:31:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"even
