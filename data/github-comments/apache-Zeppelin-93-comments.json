If you think the contents in `Zeppelin on CDH` is too short to have a separated page, you can just modify the title(\"Apache Zeppelin on Spark Cluster Mode\") and the contents of \"Overview\" in `spark_cluster_mode.md`.

Sure thing, I can do that in a bit.\n\nAs for the issue of the default value for `replName`, are you simply referring to the use case for different interpreters, or some variants of pyspark itself (eg, `%<something>.pyspark`)? If it's the latter, then I do agree that there should be a more elegant way to pick the default value in case the spark interpreter group is not set as the default, so any good ideas on how to go about this are appreciated. If you are just talking about how this is implemented on the scala (%spark) side though, I implemented a similar convenience method in the original `ZeppelinContext` class, but instead assumes \"spark\" is the default

The first one is for the different interpreter maintainers to implement in their individual subclasses of `Interpreter`, which would be used for use cases that are specific for better integrating certain features / libraries of that interpreter with zeppelin. Right now a prime example of this is matplotlib integration with python / pyspark as I have discussed in more detail in the JIRA issue.\n\nThe second set of use cases are those in which the API is directly exposed to notebook users. Right now this is indeed only fully available in spark / pyspark via the `ZeppelinContext` class. The reason for this is that getting this sort of interface to work with every interpreter would require some sort of language specific API that can be used to expose the JVM (as py4j does with python), hence one reason I labeled it as experimental in the docs. It's a similar limitation to the `angularBind()` and `angularWatch()` API. Keep in mind though that the registry can still be applied for other interpreters if the replName is manually specified, eg:\n\n``` scala\n%spark\nz.registerCallback(\"post_exec\", \"ls -l\", \"sh\")\n```\n\nDoes this help clarify things?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/249371926/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/249378204","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1439#issuecomment-249378204","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1439","id":249378204,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0OTM3ODIwNA==","user":{"login":"doanduyhai","id":1532977,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzI5Nzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1532977?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai","html_url":"https://github.com/doanduyhai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-24T17:54:27Z","updated_at":"2016-09-24T17:54:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yes it's very clear.

When I first created the JIRA issue, I came up with a quick implementation that used kept separate registries for each `Interpreter` instance. It was certainly simpler, but the main problem that I ran into was that I couldn't figure out how to make sure those changes in the registry entered by the user were broadcasted to the ZeppelinServer side. I studied the implementation of `AngularObjectRegistry` in order to understand how this could be done in Zeppelin, and that is ultimately what led me to this current implementation which uses thrift. I am still in the process of learning the core Zeppelin codebase, so if you had any specific ideas, I would appreciate it. \n\nAlso, can you also be specific on how this change would make it possible to pass actual references to functions instead of code strings (hence why I used put \"callbacks\" in quotes in the original PR)? I don't consider this to be too important but am just curious.\n\nFinally, can you provide some insight for some of the odd CI build failures I have been experiencing with more recent commits? \n\nThanks!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/249445123/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/249448844","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1439#issuecomment-249448844","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1439","id":249448844,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0OTQ0ODg0NA==","user":{"login":"Leemoonsoo","id":1540981,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDA5ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1540981?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo","html_url":"https://github.com/Leemoonsoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-25T21:49:21Z","updated_at":"2016-09-25T21:49:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"When `callback registry` places in `ZeppelinServer` process and want to let user register callback routine from the `interpreter` by exposing user `callback registry` api, then callback routine need to be serialized from `Interpreter` to send to the `ZeppelinServer`. That's why i think you send string representation of code, which is callback routine, through thrift message.\n\nIf callback registry places inside of `Interpreter` instance, `Interpreter` implementation can directly access `callback registry`. So callback routine does not need to be serialized. That means not only string representation of code, but also some java object (runnable object) can be registered into the registry.  And then [RemoteInterpreterServer](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/zeppelin-interpreter/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/interpreter/remote/RemoteInterpreterServer.java#L390)] can run callback routines before and after it invokes `Interpreter.interpret()` method. \n\nSo ZeppelinServer doesn't really need to know callback registry, i think.

you very much for the detailed explanation. To be precise, I made the `cmd` argument that gets registered a String solely because `Interpreter.interpret()` accepts a String representation of the code rather than actual callable objects. I think actually being able to do that (eg, use some API like `z.registerCallback(\"post_exec\", callback_func)` rather than `z.registerCallback(\"post_exec\", \"callback_func()\")`would depend on the language that's being interpreted and what sort of libraries are available to connect it to the JVM (eg py4j with python). \n\nNevertheless I think you have made a very compelling point. The source of my problem with my first implementation of the registry system using the `Interpreter` class was that I only considered attempting an implementation of pre/post execute from a Paragraph execution perspective. This is why I thought that I needed to broadcast changes in the registry to the `ZeppelinServer`, as I processed the registry from within the `Paragraph` class rather than from the `RemoteInterpreterServer` class. As a result of your explanation I think I understand everything a lot better now, so I'll go ahead and work on an implementation tomorrow which works exclusively through the interpreter process.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/249480001/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
