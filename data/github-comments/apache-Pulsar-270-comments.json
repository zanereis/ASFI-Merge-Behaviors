It's pleasure to have your contribution.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I just looked at the `UnAckedMessageTrackerEnabled` again. There's something to correct.\r\n\r\nWhen you created a consumer with unacked messages tracker enabled like:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n    Consumer consumer;\r\n    ConsumerConfiguration consumerConf;\r\n    consumerConf.setUnAckedMessagesTimeoutMs(11000);  // must >= 10000\r\n    consumerConf.setTickDurationInMs(11000);\r\n    Result result = client.subscribe(\"my-topic\", \"consumer-1\", consumerConf, consumer);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf `my-topic` has N partitions, N+1 `UnAckedMessageTrackerEnabled` will be created. However, **only the tracker of `PartitionedConsumerImpl` will add message id.** Because when the internal consumers were created, the listener was set with the partitioned consumer's method, see https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/102fa9de03509b86e47f58ab8e1c0dde2095da3b/pulsar-client-cpp/lib/PartitionedConsumerImpl.cc#L231-L232\r\n\r\nAnd `ConsumerImpl::messageReceived` wouldn't be called, which means `ConsumerImpl#notifyPendingReceivedCallback` and `ConsumerImpl#internalListener` wouldn't be called.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the trackers of sub-consumers only do the redelivery but not add any message id, see https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/102fa9de03509b86e47f58ab8e1c0dde2095da3b/pulsar-client-cpp/lib/PartitionedConsumerImpl.cc#L497-L499\r\n\r\n`redeliverUnacknowledgedMessages(messageIds)`  for shared and key shared subscriptions, and `redeliverUnacknowledgedMessages()` for other subscriptions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/735682181/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/735693851","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/8691#issuecomment-735693851","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/8691","id":735693851,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczNTY5Mzg1MQ==","user":{"login":"codelipenghui","id":12592133,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTkyMTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12592133?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui","html_url":"https://github.com/codelipenghui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-30T10:19:53Z","updated_at":"2020-11-30T10:19:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"/pulsarbot

I just missed here. The same message id would be added twice to unacked message tracker. \r\n\r\nAnd just now I found the reason why my test showed redelivery only happened once for each partition. It's because the partitioned consumer's redelivery timer started a little earlier than the internal consumers' redelivery timer.\r\n\r\nSo nearly each time the partitioned consumer's redelivery callback was triggered first. It called all the internal consumers' redelivery callbacks which cleared the `UnAckedMessageTracker`.\r\n\r\nFinally , it's time for the internal consumers to trigger the redelivery callback. But the redelivery wouldn't happen because the trackers were empty.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, there's a race condition which is hard to happen if the number of partitions is not large. I think the tracker of `PartitionedConsumerImpl` is redundant.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/735884386/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/735896381","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/8668#issuecomment-735896381","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/8668","id":735896381,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczNTg5NjM4MQ==","user":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-30T16:33:07Z","updated_at":"2020-11-30T16:33:07Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@rdhabalia I realized that when answering the question in the other issue. @jiazhai and I made a mistake when we added the kafka-connect-adapter for debezium.

I'd like to explain the following points:\r\n1. I've updated the [client feature matrix page](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/wiki/Client-Features-Matrix) accordingly. Some features in Websocket are not supported, yet we have plan to support them in the future. If you are familiar with any feature and would like to help, feel free to contact us.\r\n2. Effectively-once is supported for websocket. We'll provide related info in #8175, and close the issue after @cvuijst agrees.\r\n3. Nack Ack will also be supported once the PR #8249 is merged. Some test issues block #8249. We can update the website again after this PR is merged.\r\n4. Concerning the documentation: \"Through WebSockets you can publish and consume messages and use all the features available in the Java, Go, Python and C++ client libraries\", it's our ultimate target. Currently, WebSockets could not use some features. To avoid misunderstanding, maybe I can refine it as \"Through WebSockets you can publish and consume messages and use features available in the Java, Go, Python and C++ client libraries.

I'd assume that it's the best practice.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/736741873/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/736749343","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/8770#issuecomment-736749343","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/8770","id":736749343,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczNjc0OTM0Mw==","user":{"login":"michaeljmarshall","id":47911938,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3OTExOTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47911938?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaeljmarshall","html_url":"https://github.com/michaeljmarshall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaeljmarshall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaeljmarshall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaeljmarshall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaeljmarshall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaeljmarshall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaeljmarshall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaeljmarshall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaeljmarshall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaeljmarshall/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-01T18:52:57Z","updated_at":"2020-12-01T18:52:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@lhotari - thanks for your quick comment.
