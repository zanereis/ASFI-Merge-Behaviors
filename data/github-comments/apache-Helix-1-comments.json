You can then call shutdown on the transition handler.\n\nNote that I agree with you that we need a way to gracefully shutdown all transition handlers but it would be great to handle this in one place and make it common to all transition handlers rather than making it specific to taskstatemodel. Do you think you can extend this change to all transition handler? Note that with this we only need to have a shutdownhook in helixstatemachineengine and we should be able to get references to all statemodels.\n\nThis will also slow down the shutdown process depending on whats done in shutdown method. May be  we can use a marker interface to indicate that shutdown method should be invoked for these handlers\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/138981788/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/139021356","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/helix/pull/35#issuecomment-139021356","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/35","id":139021356,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzOTAyMTM1Ng==","user":{"login":"liyinan926","id":3709137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MDkxMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3709137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926","html_url":"https://github.com/liyinan926","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-09T19:26:42Z","updated_at":"2015-09-09T19:26:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@kishoreg Yes, I was actually looking at `StateTransitionHandlerFactory` and I thought about doing that.
