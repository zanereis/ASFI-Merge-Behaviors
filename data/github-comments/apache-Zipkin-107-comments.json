wget https://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=org/spf4j/spf4j-jdiff-maven-plugin/8.8.1/spf4j-jdiff-maven-plugin-8.8.1-uber.jar -O jdiff.jar\r\n$ java -jar jdiff.jar -gId io.zipkin.zipkin2 -aId

because it does not have an exclude option to handle `zipkin2.internal`.

this is not a bug.Zipkin gets service names through /services API,but only aggregation the laster 24h spans to get names.It sounds OK on most situations, but my test data is a month ago.I can set the lookback time through QUERY_LOOKBACK param,but it has a max value(less than a month).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/629783047/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/629818335","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1587#issuecomment-629818335","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1587","id":629818335,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyOTgxODMzNQ==","user":{"login":"jorgheymans","id":193792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Mzc5Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/193792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgheymans","html_url":"https://github.com/jorgheymans","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgheymans/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgheymans/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgheymans/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgheymans/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgheymans/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgheymans/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgheymans/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgheymans/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgheymans/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-17T15:45:52Z","updated_at":"2020-05-17T15:45:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"If i understood the limitation correctly, Lens (the new Zipkin UI) does not have this problem. The default lookback period is 15 minutes and includes spans received in the same minute. This can be observed by starting zipkin with self tracing enabled, `--zipkin.self-tracing.enabled=true`, then refreshing the screen a few times and clicking on the search button without changing any of the default time criteria. The result is that all the traces that were just generated seconds before show up on the screen.\r\n\r\n@feliksik @adriancole are you ok with closing this or is there still something else i'm missing
