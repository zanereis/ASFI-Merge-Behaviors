It would just result in an image with a tag like `3.2.8-SNAPSHOT` which shouldn't be a problem.\r\nThe ideal case would probably be that we use unique tags like `3.2.8-SNAPSHOT-abcde` and then tag the latest of these SNAPSHOT images additionally with `3.2.8-SNAPSHOT`, but just having the `3.2.8-SNAPSHOT` tag should also be ok.\r\nNow, doing a `mvn deploy` and therefore `docker push` for an image that was already pushed shouldn't do anything when the artifacts didn't change that go in that image.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we could also try to disable the deployment phase for this plugin for `SNAPSHOT` versions, but I don't know how we could do that with Maven.\r\n\r\n> what does adding this extra step do to the the overall build time (when building docker is enabled, of course)?\r\n\r\nI just checked with my Ubuntu VM that has just 4 cores and 6 GB RAM and got the following times for `mvn install -pl gremlin-server -DskipTests`:\r\n* Without docker build enabled: 33s\r\n* With docker build enabled and no images present: 2:10 min\r\n* With docker build enabled, but the image already present: 51s\r\n\r\nWhen no images are present locally, then it has to download and extract the OpenJDK image which is 82 MB big, that took a big part of that time.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/369661936/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/369672019","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/802#issuecomment-369672019","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/802","id":369672019,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2OTY3MjAxOQ==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-01T17:45:27Z","updated_at":"2018-03-01T17:45:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Otherwise I could also test deployment with this plugin with some test image to a private repo and then write the dev docs.\r\n\r\nThat would be great if you could test things out in private first since that is an option.

Either way though, I don't think we need to pollute the TinkerPop dockerhub with SNAPSHOT deployments. I think we should look for ways to disable the docker plugin on  `deploy` if it is a SNAPSHOT version. I'm not sure that there is a way to do that with maven directly, but I think we can come up with a way to have the effect of not sending SNAPSHOT images to dockerhub.

Changing something about the image means that the ID will change and the tag will be added to the new image. So the old one won't be available any more through Docker Hub as it isn't tagged any more. That way, we only have one image per tag available and it will always be the most recent one.\r\n\r\n>  Either way though, I don't think we need to pollute the TinkerPop dockerhub with SNAPSHOT deployments. I think we should look for ways to disable the docker plugin on deploy if it is a SNAPSHOT version.\r\n\r\nI agree, I just don't know how this could be done. The plugin [contains `skip` flags](https://github.com/spotify/dockerfile-maven#skip-docker-goals-bound-to-maven-phases), but we have to activate them somehow for SNAPSHOT

whether we rush to immediately look to merge this or push off until next release. i kinda feel like we should do the latter and not be hasty.

I also added a short note to the documentation about these interfaces for lambdas.\r\n\r\nWith all these new interfaces there is now just one Java type left for which we don't have a .NET equivalent: `VertexProgram`. So the next release will again increase type-safety of the traversal API a lot.\r\n\r\nWe are now down to just 5 ignored scenarios for `tp32` 🎉\r\n\r\n@jorgebay, you linked the Java `Lambda` interface in one of your comments. The same file also contains classes like `TwoArgLambda` that are very similar to the `Lambda` class I implemented in this PR, but they use [different methods for the different interfaces](https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/3.2.7/gremlin-core/src/main/java/org/apache/tinkerpop/gremlin/util/function/Lambda.java#L158) like:\r\n```java\r\npublic static <A> Consumer<A> consumer(final String lambdaSource,\r\n        final String lambdaLanguage)\r\n```\r\nDo we also want to have similar methods in Gremlin.Net?

I've been working with @jbaker-nca to understand this issue a bit more.\r\n\r\nOur use case for discovering this bug was essentially merging two separate graphs into a single graph.  \r\n\r\nWhen two vertices are to be merged we copy the edges from the original vertex to a new one and then proceed to remove the edges on that vertex using the following:\r\n\r\n``` java\r\nObject[] edgeIdsArr = edgeIds.toArray();\t\r\nif(edgeIdsArr.length > 0)\t\r\n    graph.traversal().E(edgeIdsArr).drop().iterate();\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce the vertices are merged we then remove the original vertices from the graph:\r\n\r\n``` java\r\nObject[] ids = mergeGroup.stream().map(Element::id).filter(Objects::nonNull).toArray();\r\nif(ids != null && ids.length > 0)\r\n    graph.traversal().V(ids).drop().iterate();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis second traversal on vertex removal is where the error would occur yielding the following exception:\r\n\r\n```\r\nException in thread

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/gremlin-users/CGkuoBkNMGI - which indicates that when removing a vertex the edges should be removed at the same time.  Therefore I modified our code to no longer remove the edges and only remove the vertices.  \r\n\r\nThis appears to have fixed our issue and we have reverted back to Tinkerpop 3.3.1 without any further issues.  However, I suspect that one should be able to remove edges and then vertices without encountering the issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/375249115/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/375271127","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/621#issuecomment-375271127","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/621","id":375271127,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NTI3MTEyNw==","user":{"login":"robertdale","id":122206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjIwNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdale","html_url":"https://github.com/robertdale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdale/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdale/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdale/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdale/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdale/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdale/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdale/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdale/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdale/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-22T11:27:37Z","updated_at":"2018-03-22T11:27:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This test has two `prettyPrint()` assertions.\r\n\r\nThe first does `prettyPrint()` no args.

The reason being is that the `CountStrategy` line is short a character thus doesn't match.\r\n**Test:**\r\n```\r\nif (line.contains(\"CountStrategy\") && line.contains(\"RangeGlobalStep(0,3)\"))\r\n```\r\n**Input:**\r\n```\r\nCountStrategy                   [O]   [VertexStep(OUT,vertex), GroupStep([VertexStep(IN,vertex), GroupCountStep([VertexStep(BOTH,vertex), RangeGlobalStep(0,3\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't know why your `160` chars is different than my `160` chars. But why is this being tested anyway?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/375271127/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/375291549","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/621#issuecomment-375291549","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/621","id":375291549,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NTI5MTU0OQ==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-22T12:46:38Z","updated_at":"2018-03-22T12:46:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm sorta +0 to add a new strategy right before release, so I'm fine to see this wait for the next round of releases. also, this is targetted at tp33 - is there a specific reason for that? given the date, i'd say we were trying to target 3.3.0, but now that it has released, should we still be looking to put this in that line or 3.4.0?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/375291549/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
