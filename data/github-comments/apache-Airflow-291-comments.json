I have brought this up in an older PR previously, let me explain again why this PR is useful.\r\n\r\nIn our use case of Airflow, we have to download some files with file name some_name_20190801.txt at 20190801 08:00 Tokyo time. So intuitively, we want to put this task on the DAG with execution_date 20190801. But at the moment, this is not possible with Airflow, even with externally triggered DAGs (i.e. `schedule_interval=None`). The reason is because Airflow scheduler does not consider tasks on the 20190801 DAG for execution until 20190801 00:00 UTC, which is 20190801 09:00 Tokyo time. So the earliest time we can run this task is at 09:00 Tokyo time.\r\n\r\nWith this constraint in mind, we came up with our own temp workaround. What we did was to put the downloader for some_name_20190801.txt on the execution_date 20190731 DAG. This works, but it’s not great because in the Web UI the DAG execution_date is shown as 20190731. Whoever looking at the DAG always gets confused because they would think the DAG is downloading files for 20190731.\r\nWith this PR by @tooptoop4, we will finally be able to put the downloader for some_name_20190801.txt on the 20190801 DAG. This greatly simplifies things.\r\n\r\nThere are other examples why this is useful. What i brought up here is only a simple one for illustration.\r\n\r\nThis PR should be pretty safe to merge because it only changes the behaviour if the DAG has `schedule_interval` set to `None` and with `run_future_exec_dates`\r\n set to True in `airflow.cfg`. And it only makes a difference if the user externally triggers the DAG before execution_date midnight in UTC timezone.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/572931603/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/572947444","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/7125#issuecomment-572947444","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/7125","id":572947444,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3Mjk0NzQ0NA==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-10T09:26:26Z","updated_at":"2020-01-10T09:26:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#

Our [pre-commits](\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/STATIC_CODE_CHECKS.rst#prerequisites-for-pre-commit-hooks)\nwill help you with that.\n- In case of a new feature add useful documentation (in docstrings or in `docs/` directory).\nAdding a new operator? Consider adding an example DAG that shows how users should use it.\n- Consider using [Breeze environment](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/BREEZE.rst) for testing\nlocally, it’s a heavy docker but it ships with a working Airflow and a lot of integrations.\n- Be patient and persistent. It might take some time to get a review or get the final approval from\nCommitters.\n\nApache Airflow is a community-driven project and together we are making it better 🚀.\n\nIn case of doubts contact the developers at:\nMailing List: dev@airflow.apache.org\nSlack: https://apache-airflow-slack.herokuapp.com/\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/572952087/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/572992250","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/7128#issuecomment-572992250","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/7128","id":572992250,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3Mjk5MjI1MA==","user":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-10T11:07:08Z","updated_at":"2020-01-10T11:07:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I've tried to add a new test case for this issue but found it's difficult because `multiprocessor.set_start_method` is needed to be called at most once.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/572992250/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/573004136","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6954#issuecomment-573004136","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6954","id":573004136,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MzAwNDEzNg==","user":{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-10T11:44:59Z","updated_at":"2020-01-10T11:44:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> @ashb pls merge\r\n\r\nWhen I said: \"Can you explain (to me here) what this does, so we can come up with a better doc comment here.\" I mean that we need to improve the doc text of that config option.

Our [pre-commits](\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/STATIC_CODE_CHECKS.rst#prerequisites-for-pre-commit-hooks)\nwill help you with that.\n- In case of a new feature add useful documentation (in docstrings or in `docs/` directory).\nAdding a new operator? Consider adding an example DAG that shows how users should use it.\n- Consider using [Breeze environment](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/BREEZE.rst) for testing\nlocally, it’s a heavy docker but it ships with a working Airflow and a lot of integrations.\n- Be patient and persistent. It might take some time to get a review or get the final approval from\nCommitters.\n\nApache Airflow is a community-driven project and together we are making it better 🚀.\n\nIn case of doubts contact the developers at:\nMailing List: dev@airflow.apache.org\nSlack: https://apache-airflow-slack.herokuapp.com/\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/573091397/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/573095527","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/7131#issuecomment-573095527","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/7131","id":573095527,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MzA5NTUyNw==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-10T16:02:15Z","updated_at":"2020-01-14T08:28:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7131?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#7131](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7131?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/commit/a0568b9536225a89e7364278450f2677fd2851d3?src=pr&el=desc) will **decrease** coverage by `0.26%`.\n> The diff coverage is `87.5%`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7131/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&token=WdLKlKHOAU&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7131?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@            Coverage Diff             @@\n##           master    #7131      +/-   ##\n==========================================\n- Coverage   85.43%   85.16%   -0.27%     \n==========================================\n  Files         710      710              \n  Lines       39373    39458      +85     \n==========================================\n- Hits        33639    33606      -33     \n- Misses       5734     5852     +118\n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7131?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [airflow/gcp/hooks/bigquery.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7131/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9nY3AvaG9va3MvYmlncXVlcnkucHk=) | `91.81% <ø> (+0.41%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [airflow/gcp/operators/bigquery.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7131/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9nY3Avb3BlcmF0b3JzL2JpZ3F1ZXJ5LnB5) | `91.59% <87.5%> (-0.49%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [airflow/kubernetes/volume\\_mount.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7131/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9rdWJlcm5ldGVzL3ZvbHVtZV9tb3VudC5weQ==) | `44.44% <0%> (-55.56%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [airflow/kubernetes/volume.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7131/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9rdWJlcm5ldGVzL3ZvbHVtZS5weQ==) | `52.94% <0%> (-47.06%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [airflow/kubernetes/pod\\_launcher.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7131/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9rdWJlcm5ldGVzL3BvZF9sYXVuY2hlci5weQ==) | `45.25% <0%> (-46.72%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [airflow/kubernetes/refresh\\_config.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7131/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9rdWJlcm5ldGVzL3JlZnJlc2hfY29uZmlnLnB5) | `50.98% <0%> (-23.53%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [...rflow/contrib/operators/kubernetes\\_pod\\_operator.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7131/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9jb250cmliL29wZXJhdG9ycy9rdWJlcm5ldGVzX3BvZF9vcGVyYXRvci5weQ==) | `78.31% <0%> (-20.49%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [airflow/jobs/backfill\\_job.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7131/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9qb2JzL2JhY2tmaWxsX2pvYi5weQ==) | `91.59% <0%> (-0.29%)` | :arrow_down: |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7131?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `?

on your first Pull Request and welcome to the Apache Airflow community!\nIf you have any issues or are unsure about any anything please check our\nContribution Guide (https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst)\n\nHere are some useful points:\n- Pay attention to the quality of your code (flake8, pylint and type annotations). Our [pre-commits](\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/STATIC_CODE_CHECKS.rst#prerequisites-for-pre-commit-hooks)\nwill help you with that.\n- In case of a new feature add useful documentation (in docstrings or in `docs/` directory).\nAdding a new operator? Consider adding an example DAG that shows how users should use it.\n- Consider using [Breeze environment](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/BREEZE.rst) for testing\nlocally, it’s a heavy docker but it ships with a working Airflow and a lot of integrations.\n- Be patient and persistent. It might take some time to get a review or get the final approval from\nCommitters.\n\nApache Airflow is a community-driven project and together we are making it better 🚀.\n\nIn case of doubts contact the developers at:\nMailing List: dev@airflow.apache.org\nSlack: https://apache-airflow-slack.herokuapp.com/\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/573204453/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/573205093","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/7135#issuecomment-573205093","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/7135","id":573205093,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MzIwNTA5Mw==","user":{"login":"boring-cyborg[bot]","id":59518230,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTk1MTgyMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/50386?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/boring-cyborg%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/boring-cyborg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boring-cyborg%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boring-cyborg%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boring-cyborg%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boring-cyborg%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boring-cyborg%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boring-cyborg%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boring-cyborg%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boring-cyborg%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boring-cyborg%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-10T21:05:09Z","updated_at":"2020-01-10T21:05:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Awesome work, congrats on your first merged pull request!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/573205093/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/573214694","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6230#issuecomment-573214694","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6230","id":573214694,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MzIxNDY5NA==","user":{"login":"davlum","id":26053671,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDUzNjcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26053671?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davlum","html_url":"https://github.com/davlum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davlum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davlum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davlum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davlum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davlum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davlum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davlum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davlum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davlum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-10T21:35:44Z","updated_at":"2020-01-10T21:35:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"As an aside, I really wish the `executor_config` argument simply accepted a `PodGenerator` object instead of a dict.

Right now, it looks like it serializes to a float (as number of seconds) and doesn't get converted back on deserialization. I could manually convert it here https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/7119/files#diff-108fa7b4349eeb1a31c07c64a952c972R52, but that seems a bit hacky to me. Looking at the `_deserialize` function here https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/airflow/serialization/serialized_objects.py#L200, it seems like there is the possibility to have it marked as a `timedelta`, but I can't seem to figure out where I would do that. Do I need to add typing to the property or maybe I define `__serialized_fields` differently?\r\n\r\nWe have 2 options:\r\n\r\n1) Add `execution_delta` in  https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/airflow/serialization/serialized_objects.py#L343\r\n\r\n2) Add `execution_delta` in `_decorated_fields` (https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/airflow/serialization/serialized_objects.py#L273)\r\n\r\nI think, probably adding it in (1) makes more sense.

Our [pre-commits](\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/STATIC_CODE_CHECKS.rst#prerequisites-for-pre-commit-hooks)\nwill help you with that.\n- In case of a new feature add useful documentation (in docstrings or in `docs/` directory).\nAdding a new operator? Consider adding an example DAG that shows how users should use it.\n- Consider using [Breeze environment](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/BREEZE.rst) for testing\nlocally, it’s a heavy docker but it ships with a working Airflow and a lot of integrations.\n- Be patient and persistent. It might take some time to get a review or get the final approval from\nCommitters.\n\nApache Airflow is a community-driven project and together we are making it better 🚀.\n\nIn case of doubts contact

Since it's a bit of work to merge against v1-10-test, I put up this PR to do that.

It doesn't look related to my change, e.g. test_cli.py timesout. test_external_task_sensors.py times out in one of the test profiles (Tests sqlite python 3.5), again I don't think it's due to my change.

Our [pre-commits](\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/STATIC_CODE_CHECKS.rst#prerequisites-for-pre-commit-hooks)\nwill help you with that.\n- In case of a new feature add useful documentation (in docstrings or in `docs/` directory).\nAdding a new operator? Consider adding an example DAG that shows how users should use it.\n- Consider using [Breeze environment](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/BREEZE.rst) for testing\nlocally, it’s a heavy docker but it ships with a working Airflow and a lot of integrations.\n- Be patient and persistent. It might take some time to get a review or get the final approval from\nCommitters.\n\nApache Airflow is a community-driven project and together we are making it better 🚀.\n\nIn case of doubts contact
