so no need to maintain the exclusion list. The exclusion list is cumbersome and fragile, which seems to be also the reason why travis failed: one missing exclusion resulting in a collision on the service entries between different jackson version (one from Avro, other from Schema Registry).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/441473526/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/441478603","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/7099#issuecomment-441478603","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/7099","id":441478603,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MTQ3ODYwMw==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-25T22:15:33Z","updated_at":"2018-11-25T22:15:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think this is a very nice feature, +1 to have this.\r\n\r\nWe have seen other use cases that need a similar mechanism, so I am wondering if we can generify this to a some transient aggregator.

Let's deprecate `OrCondition`, `AndCondition`, `NotCondition` with a comment that they exist only for backwards compatibility and advice to use the rich versions. (Agreed, let's do this in a separate PR/issue: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-10113)\r\n2. Mark all the conditions in `conditions` package `@Internal`\r\n3. I would be in favor of unifying the null handling in the new classes in a way that we do not allow nulls there. We can change the `getCondition` method in `Pattern` to return `BooleanConditions#trueFunction` if nothing was set. This will make the whole logic more explicit IMHO. Let's leave the old classes as they are, as we want to drop them anyway.\r\n4. Use the new rich conditions in `Pattern#where` and `Pattern#or`. Add a test that checks if rich interfaces work for those

I’m personally fine with multiple commits in one PR, some of them might be “hotfixes” some of them “jira issues”, some of them may refer to the same jira issue. \r\n\r\nThe important things for me are:\r\n1. one commit does one thing\r\n2. the smaller commits the easier to review\r\n3. renames/refactorings that do not change semantics/add new features ALWAYS in separate commit\r\n4. if you do multiple independent refactorings/renames, each on of them should be in separate commit\r\n5. two following up commits shouldn’t modify the same code (unless one is pure refactor like deduplicating the code and another is adding feature/bug fixing).\r\n\r\nThis speeds up reviewing and later reading the code by browsing  git history “why something was done in a way it was done” - extreme example: finding 1 line bug fix hidden within 1000 lines of renames/refactoring is not easy. Or trying to figure out whether some change was relevant to the bug fix or not. While on the other hand, having a small commit with good commit message explaining why something was implemented often helps a lot if you go through git annotations in IDE.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/442358466/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/442363596","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/7182#issuecomment-442363596","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/7182","id":442363596,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MjM2MzU5Ng==","user":{"login":"yanghua","id":2283778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODM3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2283778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua","html_url":"https://github.com/yanghua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-28T08:36:48Z","updated_at":"2018-11-28T08:36:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"cc @pnowojski ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/442363596/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/442372337","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/7175#issuecomment-442372337","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/7175","id":442372337,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MjM3MjMzNw==","user":{"login":"shaoxuan-wang","id":9400874,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0MDA4NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9400874?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaoxuan-wang","html_url":"https://github.com/shaoxuan-wang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaoxuan-wang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaoxuan-wang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaoxuan-wang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaoxuan-wang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaoxuan-wang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaoxuan-wang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaoxuan-wang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaoxuan-wang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaoxuan-wang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-28T09:06:35Z","updated_at":"2018-11-28T09:06:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @yuanyangwu , thanks for the contribution.
