The increase in storage. We had some discussion before v1.0 about whether we should switch to long or not. ALS is not computation heavy for small k but communication heavy. I posted some screenshots on the JIRA page, where ALS shuffles ~200GB data in each iteration. With Long ids, this number may become ~300GB and hence ALS may slow down by 50%. Instead of upgrading the id type to Long, I'm actually thinking about downgrading the rating type to Float.\n2. Is collision really bad? ALS needs somewhat \"dense\" matrix to compute good recommendations. If there are 3 billion users but each user only gives 1 or 2 ratings, ALS is very likely to overfit. In this case, making a random projection on the user side would certainly help, while hashing is one of the commonly used techniques for random projection. There will be bad recommendations no matter whether there exist hash collisions or not. So I'm really interested in some measurements on the downside of hash collision.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49131064/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49131783","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1427#issuecomment-49131783","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1427","id":49131783,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MTMxNzgz","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-16T07:21:30Z","updated_at":"2014-07-16T07:21:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA
