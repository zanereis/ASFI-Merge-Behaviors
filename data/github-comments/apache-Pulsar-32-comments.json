I came here to suggest offloading data into object storage so that the client would not even notice and you are already working on it. Thank you!\r\n\r\nFood for thought: It is the Pulsar client's responsibility to compress and decompress messages. However, I wonder if for some use cases it might make sense to store only compressed data in the object storage while within the cluster the data would stay in decompressed form. I would find it simpler if in most cases the client would not need to worry about storage yet the cluster admins could use storage space efficiently.\r\n\r\nDo you think it makes sense to include compression in the scope of tiered storage? Or is this an object storage implementation issue that should be handled by Minio, for example?\r\n\r\nFor reference, xz compresses our most voluminous JSON events into 5 % of the original

@merlimat \r\nAs per discussion, we want pulsar replicator to use pulsar-connector to replicate messages to external systems. It seems [ReplicatorProducer-API](https://github.com/rdhabalia/pulsar/blob/2c9e499af0a685ef2dbeac01fbaa738040212788/pulsar-replicator/providers/provider/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/replicator/api/ReplicatorProducer.java) in replicator framework is similar as [Sink-API](https://github.com/apache/incubator-pulsar/blob/master/pulsar-connect/core/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/connect/core/Sink.java) so, we will not require any significant change for Sink api and replicator should be using it with small changes in it.\r\nRight now, Sink API accepts different [Message](https://github.com/apache/incubator-pulsar/blob/master/pulsar-connect/core/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/connect/core/Message.java) type than pulsar [Message](https://github.com/apache/incubator-pulsar/blob/master/pulsar-client/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/client/api/Message.java) which requires replicator to create additional unnecessary object. So, I created PR-#1632 to use Pulsar-message in Sink api.\r\n\r\nPulsar replicator implementation mainly touches 3 things:\r\n1. Onboarding api\r\n2. Replicator function that initializes connectors\r\n3. pulsar connector that actually publish messages to external system.\r\n\r\n#1594 covers all above functionalities. so, once pulsar-connector [PR]() is merged, I will rebase replicator-PR on top of it and later in separate PR, we can merge replicator and connector in one module.\r\n\r\nCan you please let us know your thoughts.?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/383422108/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/383565282","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/1266#issuecomment-383565282","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/1266","id":383565282,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MzU2NTI4Mg==","user":{"login":"maskit","id":153144,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzE0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/153144?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maskit","html_url":"https://github.com/maskit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maskit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maskit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maskit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maskit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maskit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maskit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maskit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maskit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maskit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-23T12:56:30Z","updated_at":"2018-04-23T12:56:30Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@lucperkins As I wrote on my last comment, we have an event page but we haven't passed the check because the check is a bit strict.
