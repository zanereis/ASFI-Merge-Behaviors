functions:\r\n\r\nI think using `fn` for function types is a good idea and an easy change to make.\r\n\r\nThe reason for using `->` over `=>` is both for consistency with Python annotations and also because lines like `let %_: () -> Int64 = fn () -> Int64 { 0 }; ()` are easier to read than `let %_: () => Int64 = fn () => Int64 { 0 }; ()` since `=>` visually interferes with `=`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/431538974/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/431539058","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/1782#issuecomment-431539058","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1782","id":431539058,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMTUzOTA1OA==","user":{"login":"joshpoll","id":21694516,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjk0NTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21694516?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll","html_url":"https://github.com/joshpoll","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-20T01:47:21Z","updated_at":"2018-10-20T01:47:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I

Having all the base types in lower-case is also not a too bad design choice.  As for the case of shape generic variable, since we are already using % prefix for all the variables, likely we will also have similar prefix so these variables won't be confused with the base types anyway.\r\n\r\nIn short, I think we should favor the principle  \"be python and numpy consistent as much as possible\".

for the contribution. We can likely further simplify this by using tvm's runtime system for callback. TVM support generated code to callback any PackedFunc (including ones from python).\r\n\r\nHere is a rough example, it is only used to demonstrate how the lowered callback works. Some future wrapping around this mechanism might make the trace API easier to use\r\n\r\n```python\r\n\r\nimport tvm\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\n\r\n@tvm.register_func\r\ndef my_debug(x, i):\r\n    print(\"array=\", x.asnumpy())\r\n    return 0\r\n\r\n\r\nx = tvm.placeholder((4,), name=\"x\", dtype=\"int32\")\r\nxbuffer = tvm.decl_buffer(x.shape, dtype=x.dtype)\r\n\r\ny = tvm.compute(x.shape, lambda i: tvm.call_packed(\"my_debug\", xbuffer))\r\ns = tvm.create_schedule(y.op)\r\n\r\nprint(tvm.lower(s, [x, y], binds={x:xbuffer}, simple_mode=True))\r\n\r\nf = tvm.build(s, [xbuffer, y], binds={x:xbuffer})\r\nxnd = tvm.nd.array(np.ones((4,), dtype=x.dtype))\r\nynd = tvm.nd.array(np.zeros((4,), dtype=y.dtype))\r\n\r\nf(xnd, ynd)\r\n```\r\nIn the above case, the call_packed calls my_debug in every iteration passing the array handle(xbuffer). Some further wrapping could make it looks nicer. The good part is, we can use any piece of python code to monitor the content of x\r\nSee more at
