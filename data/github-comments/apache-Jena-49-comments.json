Using Google, I found one match which explains a bit about the history:\r\nThe paper [RDF/XML SOURCE DECLARATION](https://inria.hal.science/hal-01154396/document) says:\r\n\r\n> [...] In another attempt, (De Vos, 2001) proposed to annotate property elements with the attribute rdf:parseType=\"Statements\" to indicate that their content is considered the same as the content model of the rdf:RDF element but that the statements are in a separate context. [...]\r\n\r\nI tried to register for the [CIM user group](https://cimug.ucaiug.org/) to report the issue. Unfortunately, I could not find any working interactive elements, such as issues, discussions, contact forms, or anything else. Their pages seem to be quite restrictive and buggy.\r\n\r\nFor me, the CIM-DifferenceModels were the primary reason I started using Apache Jena. It was then that I first realized that CIM is not merely an XML format, but is fundamentally based on the concepts of RDF and graphs. Using DifferenceModels in conjunction with hardcoded entities (often generated from UML or XSD) is almost impossible or, at least, very cumbersome. \r\nA lot of the existing tools and solutions do not treat CIM as being based on RDF and graph principles. I suppose that’s why, for instance, there isn’t a single ENTSO-E CIM-based data exchange process in place today that supports the DifferenceModels. \r\nI guess that is also one reason why, over all those years, they did not recognize that their DifferenceModel format is not compatible with the RDF/XML standard.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/2112143480/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/2115297139","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/issues/2473#issuecomment-2115297139","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/2473","id":2115297139,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec5-FN9z","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-16T13:46:39Z","updated_at":"2024-05-17T17:02:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi @arne - thank you for the \"ENTSO-E - CIM Conformity and Interoperability\" reference and the test suite details.\r\n\r\ntl;dr: there is case for allowing \"Statements\". Handling bare XML attribute `parseType` in normal mode seems to be on dodgy ground.\r\n\r\n> @afs I don't understand parts of your answer:\r\n> \r\n> * Is there a \"deprecation of parseType\"? To me, rdf:parseType=\"Literal\" does not seem to be deprecated.\r\n\r\nIn the report, there is a bare `parseType` and no default namespace. Correct is a namespaced XML attribute (e.g. `rdf:parseType`).\r\n\r\n>> XML attribute 'parseType' used for RDF property attribute - ignored\r\n\r\nRDF 1.0 RDF/XML (https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/#section-Syntax-XML-literals) does not allow it. The fact ARP warns it is deprecated goes back a long time, pre RDF 1.0. I can't find a report of the deprecation - it's probbaly in email achieves pre-2004.\r\n\r\nThis is unrelated to the use of \"Statements\".\r\n\r\nSo the questions I have for bare `parseType`:\r\n* How common is bare `parseType` even in CIM usage? Basically - is the data wrong? A one off occurence?\r\n* Is it corrected in later versions/errata? If we take [ENTSO-E - CIM Conformity and Interoperability](https://www.entsoe.eu/data/cim/cim-conformity-and-interoperability/), then bare `parseType` is right only for data that has not been updated.\r\n\r\nThe link seems to imply it's faulty data.\r\n\r\nBut if it is common+common, saying \"normal for CIM\", then adding it directly to RRX still has to answer whether it should allow non-standard usage - it is bad use of XML.\r\n\r\nOne possibility - add a \"CIM\" language with a \"CIM Reader\" that inherits from ParserRDFXML_SAX with customization hooks (or a context setting.)\r\n\r\nBTW, the RDF/XML writers don't write bare form. They will make up a namespace name if the data has not defined in the graph for `http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#`.\r\n\r\n> * \"With corrections: (5.1.0 dev - there was a nearby change to RRX)\"\r\n>   --> The result looks okay, but what corrections? I checked out \"main\" with \"5.1.0-SNAPSHOT\" and still got the error.\r\n> \r\n> Since I also don't have access to the CIM IEC specifications, I can only refer to [ENTSO-E - CIM Conformity and Interoperability](https://www.entsoe.eu/data/cim/cim-conformity-and-interoperability/) where the latest \"Version 3 since August 2022\" of the \"CGMES Conformity Assessment Scheme v3\" contains examples using \"rdf:parseType=\"Statements\"\" in the [Test Configurations v3.0.2](https://www.entsoe.eu/Documents/CIM_documents/Grid_Model_CIM/ENTSO-E_Test_Configurations_v3.0.2.zip) (e.g. ENTSO-E_Test_Configurations_v3.0.2/v3.0/FullGrid/FullGrid_OP_diff/FullGrid_OP_diff.xml).\r\n\r\nFor \"Statements\", it is in a current spec and that could be added to the RRX parsers.

The namespace should always be `rdf:parseType=\"Statements\"`.\r\n\r\nGoogle discovered an old draft of the IEC standard  [Part 5xx: CIM XML Model Exchange Format](https://cimug.ucaiug.org/WG13/Part%20552%20CIM%20XML%20Model%20Exchange%20Format%20[Martin%20Miller]/Edition%201/57_1262e_CDV.pdf) . For example, on page 21, the RDF example lacks the namespace, but the text explicitly mentions the correct namespace.\r\n\r\n> Just for clarification with the namespace “dm” new statements are introduced that are valid\r\nextensions to the standard RDF syntax through the new property rdf:parseType, which is called\r\nStatements. \r\n&lt;property parseType=”Statements”>\r\n   &lt;!-- Content: (definition|description)* -->\r\n&lt;/property>\r\nThe content model of an element with rdf:parseType=”Statements” is the same as the content\r\nmodel of the rdf:RDF element.\r\n\r\nToday I also discovered the [RDF Syntax User Guide](https://eepublicdownloads.entsoe.eu/clean-documents/CIM_documents/Grid_Model_CIM/RDF-SyntaxUserGuide_v1-0.pdf) listed on https://www.entsoe.eu/data/cim/cim-for-grid-models-exchange/, which contains a chapter \"General differences between CIM XML (552) and RDF XML (W3C)\". This chapter explains a lot right at the beginning:\r\n\r\n> The CIM XML is defined in the IEC 61970-552:2016. This version of the standard is based on\r\na much earlier edition in which some serialization assumptions were made. Important: When \r\nthe initial version of IEC 61970-552 was developed, the W3C recommendations on RDF XML\r\nwere not released. Therefore, there was a growing gap during the last two decades. The latest\r\nRDF XML was standardized by W3C in 2014 (RDF 1.1 XML Syntax (w3.org)) and IEC 61970-552 \r\ndid not align with this due to existing implementations objecting changes in CIM XML.\r\n\r\nIt lists many of the issues I've stumbled upon over the last few years. Unfortunately, the rdf:parseType=\"Statements\" issue is missing from this chapter.\r\n\r\nThere, I also found the latest [Metadata and Document Header Data Exchange Specification](https://www.entsoe.eu/Documents/CIM_documents/Grid_Model_CIM/MetadataAndHeaderDataExchangeSpecification_v2.3.0.pdf), which includes parts of the Difference Model Specification:\r\n\r\n> The content [of the DifferenceModel] is described by the Model class, the\r\nassociation role forwardDifferences and association role reverseDifferences. Both association\r\nroles may have one set of Statements.\r\n[chapter \"7.3 (dm) DifferenceModel\", page 33]\r\n\r\nDescription for \"forwardDifferences\":\r\n> A property of the difference model whose value is a collection of statements (i.e., resources of type rdf:Statement) representing the forward difference statements.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith Jena, I would want to be able to parse the forwardDifferences and backwardDifferences into separate graphs, so that I can apply them as additions and deletions, or use them in a `org.apache.jena.graph.compose.Delta`.\r\n\r\nHere is sample code to illustrate a way to read the forwardDifferences as a graph:\r\n\r\n```\r\nString xml = \"<rdf:RDF \\n\" +\r\n        \"    xml:base=\\\"http://iec.ch/TC57/2014/CIM-schema-cim16#\\\"\\n\" +\r\n        \"    xmlns:dm=\\\"http://iec.ch/2002/schema/CIM_difference_model#\\\" \\n\" +\r\n        \"    xmlns:md=\\\"http://iec.ch/TC57/61970-552/ModelDescription/1#\\\"\\n\" +\r\n        \"    xmlns:cim=\\\"http://iec.ch/TC57/2014/CIM-schema-cim16#\\\"\\n\" +\r\n        \"    xmlns:meta=\\\"http://iec.ch/TC57/2014/CIM-schema-cim16#\\\"\\n\" +\r\n        \"    xmlns:rdf=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\\\">\\n\" +\r\n        \"<dm:DifferenceModel rdf:about=\\\"#_248c809d-1d7b-397c-830f-6928007ae6d9\\\">                \\n\" +\r\n        \"<md:Model.version>1715589426</md:Model.version>\\n\" +\r\n        \"<md:Model.created>2024-05-13T08:37:06.830Z</md:Model.created>\\n\" +\r\n        \"<md:Model.scenarioTime>2024-05-13T08:37:06.830Z</md:Model.scenarioTime>\\n\" +\r\n        \"<md:Model.profile>http://profile/</md:Model.profile>\\n\" +\r\n        \"<md:Model.modelingAuthoritySet>unknown</md:Model.modelingAuthoritySet>\\n\" +\r\n        \"<meta:Model.modelVersionIri>http://ontology.adms.ru/UIP/md/2021-1</meta:Model.modelVersionIri>\\n\" +\r\n        \"<meta:Model.differenceFrom>2024-04-01T07:55:06.779475Z</meta:Model.differenceFrom>\\n\" +\r\n        \"<meta:Model.differenceTo>2027-10-01T08:37:06.779475Z</meta:Model.differenceTo>\\n\" +\r\n        \"<dm:forwardDifferences rdf:parseType=\\\"Statements\\\">\\n\" +\r\n        \"<cim:A rdf:about=\\\"#_individual-A-1\\\">\\n\" +\r\n        \"<cim:A-2-B rdf:resource=\\\"#_individual-B-1\\\"/>\\n\" +\r\n        \"</cim:A>\\n\" +\r\n        \"<cim:B rdf:about=\\\"#_individual-B-1\\\"/>\\n\" +\r\n        \"<cim:D rdf:about=\\\"#_individual-D-1\\\"/>\\n\" +\r\n        \"</dm:forwardDifferences>\\n\" +\r\n        \"<dm:reverseDifferences parseType=\\\"Statements\\\">\\n\" +\r\n        \"</dm:reverseDifferences>\\n\" +\r\n        \"</dm:DifferenceModel>\\n\" +\r\n        \"</rdf:RDF> \";\r\n\r\n\r\nModel res = ModelFactory.createDefaultModel();\r\nRDFParserBuilder\r\n        .create()\r\n        .fromString(xml)\r\n        .forceLang(Lang.RDFXML)\r\n        .build()\r\n        .parse(res);\r\n\r\nRDFDataMgr.write(System.out, res, RDFFormat.JSONLD11_PRETTY);\r\n\r\nvar subjDiffModel = NodeFactory.createURI(\"http://iec.ch/TC57/2014/CIM-schema-cim16#_248c809d-1d7b-397c-830f-6928007ae6d9\");\r\nvar predForwardDifferences = NodeFactory.createURI(\"http://iec.ch/2002/schema/CIM_difference_model#forwardDifferences\");\r\n//get the forward differences\r\nvar objForwardDifferences = res.getGraph().find(subjDiffModel, predForwardDifferences, Node.ANY).next().getObject();\r\n\r\n//create a new RDF/XML graph\r\nvar forwardRDF = \"<rdf:RDF \\n\" +\r\n        \"    xml:base=\\\"http://iec.ch/TC57/2014/CIM-schema-cim16#\\\"\\n\" +\r\n        \"    xmlns:dm=\\\"http://iec.ch/2002/schema/CIM_difference_model#\\\" \\n\" +\r\n        \"    xmlns:md=\\\"http://iec.ch/TC57/61970-552/ModelDescription/1#\\\"\\n\" +\r\n        \"    xmlns:cim=\\\"http://iec.ch/TC57/2014/CIM-schema-cim16#\\\"\\n\" +\r\n        \"    xmlns:meta=\\\"http://iec.ch/TC57/2014/CIM-schema-cim16#\\\"\\n\" +\r\n        \"    xmlns:rdf=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\\\">\\n\" +\r\n        objForwardDifferences.getLiteralLexicalForm() +\r\n        \"</rdf:RDF>\";\r\n\r\nvar forwardGraph = GraphFactory.createGraphMem();\r\nforwardGraph.getPrefixMapping().setNsPrefixes(res.getNsPrefixMap());\r\nRDFParserBuilder\r\n        .create()\r\n        .fromString(forwardRDF)\r\n        .forceLang(Lang.RDFXML)\r\n        .build()\r\n        .parse(forwardGraph);\r\n\r\n\r\nRDFDataMgr.write(System.out, forwardGraph, RDFFormat.JSONLD11_PRETTY);\r\n```\r\nThis process is not pretty, and writing DifferenceModels might even be uglier.\r\n\r\nAccepting `rdf:parseType=\"Statements\"` seems to be a good compromise to ensure that Jena is regarded as a stable component in any CIM/XML tool chain. \r\n\r\n### Next Steps ?\r\nI would like to approach ENTSO-E so that they may extend their chapter \"General differences between CIM XML (552) and RDF XML (W3C).\" Proposing the use of rdf:parseType=\"Literal\" to improve general compatibility with RDF/XML could be one suggestion. However, does anyone have a good idea on how to express DifferenceModels with nested graphs for forwardDifferences and backwardDifferences in RDF/XML?

But if there is to be CIM/JSON-LD, then the distinction ought to be ignored or converted to a property because it is an RDF/XML specific feature.\r\n* `xml:base`  -- This can be addressed in processing parser output with an `RDFStream` on the way to the model for storage. Uses a URI with private scheme e.g. `base:` as a marker. Teh data then has relative URIs/. Use with care!\r\n* Schema-defined datatyping. Very much inspired by XML!  \r\n  It can be done by feeding the parse output to an `RDFStream` that looks for the properties with schema-defined datatype and converting the triple object from string to the datatype. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOne way to encode the difference is use named graphs: if for JSON-LD, then using a blank node graph name is natural. This is using RDF datasets as \"packages of graphs\" - the default graph is the manifest and main data, the named graphs are sets of triples referred to from the default graph.\r\n\r\nHowever, there isn't a standard dataset/quads syntax based on XML. (TriX is a sort of de-facto standard but it isn't pretty.) \r\n\r\nBased on the package idea, there is always a zip file with named files as named graphs.

My bad, I shared not full config, I missed also .addFilter() method adding custom endpoints which, as turned out, was the root cause of the problem. \r\n\r\nIt is still strange to me as it works just fine if I add a pretty simple filter which just pass the request. But with the production used filters it does not work. In the production code we pass the a group of endpoints implemented via javaspark framework, and the issue emerges in exception handling.  I added there a logic to skip the endpoint for SPARQL query and it works just fine. The thing I am still confused about is that we did't change the version of JavaSpark, the issue is reproduced  only when I upgrade Jena version. I guess that something has changed in Jetty, like filters priority or something like that. Any ideas?\r\n\r\nOff-topic (let me know if I should raise a separate question for that): we are using DatasetGraphMonitor in our app having a lot of logic to perform post-actions within transaction. It's being removed, what should be used instead?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/2124809905/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/2125381127","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/issues/2488#issuecomment-2125381127","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/2488","id":2125381127,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec5-rr4H","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-22T17:27:12Z","updated_at":"2024-05-22T17:38:14Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Off-topic (let me know if I should raise a separate question for that)\r\n\r\nYes please.
