Let me explain more details. \r\n\r\n- without `-Ploose-checkstyle`, maven will print all WARNINGs. So people will see these warnings while developing (**default**)\r\n- with `-Ploose-checkstyle`, maven will **not** print warnings at all. This prevent 4MB log size limitation in travis CI\r\n- Initially, `CHECKSTYLE=1` profile was introduced to get people awared about warnings but it causes build failure since we have verbose zeppelin log (too many info log. it's not good). So I removed that profile.  Additionally, `CHECKSTYLE=1` profile is meaningless because other profiles do checkstyle also currently. (FYI, splitting checkstyle doesn't reduce total build time much. approx under 5 secs as i know)\r\n\r\nSo I would like to add `CHECKSTYLE=1` profile when it is meaningful (after regulating some logging levels, having strict checkstyle rules)\r\n\r\n### `loose-checkstyle` profile definition in pom.xml\r\n\r\n```\r\n    <profile>\r\n      <id>loose-checkstyle</id>\r\n      <build>\r\n        <plugins>\r\n          <plugin>\r\n            <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>\r\n            <artifactId>maven-checkstyle-plugin</artifactId>\r\n            <configuration>\r\n              <consoleOutput>false</consoleOutput>\r\n            </configuration>\r\n          </plugin>\r\n        </plugins>\r\n      </build>\r\n    </profile>\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/266709041/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/266710611","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1750#issuecomment-266710611","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1750","id":266710611,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NjcxMDYxMQ==","user":{"login":"AhyoungRyu","id":10060731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYwNzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10060731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu","html_url":"https://github.com/AhyoungRyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-13T11:06:32Z","updated_at":"2016-12-13T11:06:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@felixcheung \r\nI just tested this patch only in dev mode.

The problem is that Zeppelin calls `spark-submit` only once in `shared` and `scoped` modes when initializing interpreter, and afterwards single spark context is used. Thus it makes having impersonation through `--proxy-user` on spark interpreter in `shared` and `scoped` mode *complicated*. For isolated mode, it's easier since we can pass user with SparkConf for each spark context on initialization. any suggestions /opinions are welcome.\r\n\r\nand thanks @astroshim for PR and help, that would work in isolated mode.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/266721268/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/266723927","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1566#issuecomment-266723927","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1566","id":266723927,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NjcyMzkyNw==","user":{"login":"zjffdu","id":164491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu","html_url":"https://github.com/zjffdu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-13T12:15:39Z","updated_at":"2016-12-13T12:15:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"That's correct, impersonation for spark interpreter can only be applied to isolated mode.

A time stamp is generated only if a `folder` already exists in the trash. But it's not generated when moving a `note` to the trash.\r\n\r\nI made this feature because of a **use case** like this:\r\n### A use case needs time stamp\r\n1. A user moves \"NoteDirA\" folder to the trash\r\n2. And the user create a folder which has the same name (\"NoteDirA\")\r\n3. After a month from then, the user forgot the existence of the folder already exists in the trash, and moves the folder to the trash which created later\r\n4. But it was a mistake and the user wants to restore the folder created later\r\n\r\n### Necessity of the time stamp for the use case above\r\n\r\n**If there is no time stamp:**\r\nThe folder created later will be merged into old one and the folder \"NoteDirA\" will be messy.\r\n\r\n#### If there is a time stamp:\r\nThe folder created later will be moved to the trash with a time stamp postfix. There will be two folders which are \"NoteDirA\" (old one) and \"NoteDirA removed at 2016-12-14 xx:xx:xx\" (new one). In this case, the user can restore the folder successfully.\r\n\r\nThis is why I added time stamp! :-) Please tell me if there is any other idea.\r\n\r\n### Remove permanently icon candidates (?)\r\nI agree with you so I searched Font Awesome and found some candidates for the icon. I think not only `empty trash` but also `Remove note permanently` and `Remove folder permanently` should be replaced together. \r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8201019/21180874/543a32b0-c23e-11e6-9f5f-25a0fa25bb84.png)\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8201019/21180952/c8ce421a-c23e-11e6-9297-f7df93a36ef5.png)\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8201019/21180965/e9a051ea-c23e-11e6-96b8-7df5469a87cf.png)\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8201019/21181004/179fe736-c23f-11e6-9e58-36ade60959c4.png)\r\n\r\nThe icons above are the candidates I found, but please let me know if you have a better one!\r\n\r\nWhich icon do you prefer? üòÑ\r\n\r\nThanks for the review again üëç ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/267023347/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/267023929","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1760#issuecomment-267023929","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1760","id":267023929,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NzAyMzkyOQ==","user":{"login":"AhyoungRyu","id":10060731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYwNzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10060731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu","html_url":"https://github.com/AhyoungRyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-14T12:39:51Z","updated_at":"2016-12-14T12:39:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@fred777 Thanks for your contribution.
