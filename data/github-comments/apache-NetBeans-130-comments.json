Note: \nComputer was on all day and NetBeans 15 was loaded and running.\n\nSee images of your code captured tonight. Note: Had to take picture of \nwarning message. Otherwise, it disappears when focus is lost upon \nactivating my snipping tool.\n\nThis seems a real bug but not a showstopper for me. I hope to provide \nsolid clues as I carry on with coding. So would like to keep the issue \nopen.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nBrian H.

A lucene upgrade would also affect public API of NB modules since some expose lucene directly in their APIs. I worked a little bit on that locally but got stuck and ran out of time.\r\n\r\nI haven't looked through the CVE in detail. But vulnerabilities like this rarely affect software like IDEs since they don't expose search queries to third parties.\r\n\r\nIf you think there is a vulnerability in NB (e.g an attack vector), please follow the rules described here: \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/netbeans/security/policy\r\n(listing a CVE of a third party lib is not a sufficient reason to use that email address though) \r\n\r\npinging @neilcsmith-net @matthiasblaesing for more opinions","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1269314768/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1269320992","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/4737#issuecomment-1269320992","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4737","id":1269320992,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5LqE0g","user":{"login":"mbien","id":114367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien","html_url":"https://github.com/mbien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-06T05:09:07Z","updated_at":"2022-10-06T05:09:07Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"sounds like a duplicate of #3962\r\n\r\nclosing until proven wrong :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1269320992/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1269329248","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/4738#issuecomment-1269329248","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4738","id":1269329248,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5LqG1g","user":{"login":"mbien","id":114367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien","html_url":"https://github.com/mbien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-06T05:21:05Z","updated_at":"2022-10-06T05:21:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"not sure how to reproduce this.

The last sentence of the initial comment does suggest that things weren't done right, and implies that it should be handled better. I saw FileChooserBuilder, that method `findDialogParent` could be put somewhere public, maybe `DialogDisplayer`, and I could rerun jackpot with that. But then there's a testing problem, I don't know how to force most of those dialogs. But I believe that would be better than the current state, and maybe not as reliable as this current PR. I'm suspect about `findDialogParent` picking the last frame in the list.\r\n\r\nI don't trust `KeyboardFocusManager.getActiveWindow`. I think it returns null at inconvenient times, see https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/4714#issue-1393511869 third paragraph; I've been thinking about a patch to DialogDisplayerImpl that handles a null return from KFM.getActiveWindow and makes a choice.

As alternative Base64/32 might be better create one mapping file like `categories.map` with json or some another format that associates a category name with a category body file and all body files will be named by increment algorithm (category1.c, category2.c ... categoryN.c)?

was using a PluralSight course to study how to get NetBeans working for a PHP/jQuery project I'm working on. PluralSight focuses only on Java. But since it was the only course they had, I tried following along until I ran into installation problems perhaps because installing XAMPP required a different JDK installation. (For the record, my computer, which is set up for XAMPP, did not allow me to set dependencies within NetBeans when it was being used for Java in the PluralSight course.)\r\n\r\nSo I had to quit that course. Then I found that NetBeans had a learning path that seemed applicable to me, and I started with the HTML 5 learning path — for the same reason that we often start with learning how to print Hello World. Here again, I am stymied because the NetBeans community seems to be entirely focused on Java. If you're not going to support PHP, HTML 5, etc., it doesn't make sense to advertise NetBeans for these languages.\r\n\r\nIn particular, removing resources for whatever reason without comment and without advising students where to go for replacing those resources doesn't seem fair to students who are trying to learn to use your product. I'm a student, and therefore I don't know so much. I'm trying to learn stuff. It's hard for me if you don't provide a workaround. For the record, I'm 71 years old.\r\n\r\nI noticed that the NetBeans Connector was last updated on September 9, 2015, which is more than seven years ago. There has been a huge amount of change in the inspectors for the various browsers since then. I'm curious whether the tutorial for NetBeans and HTML5 is even up to date. For a student, learning from out-of-state information can be worse than no study at all. Out-of-date information should be at least marked as such with a URL or a recommendation about where to get more up-to-date information.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1272164839/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1272250000","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/4735#issuecomment-1272250000","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4735","id":1272250000,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5L1P6Q","user":{"login":"tmysik","id":331924,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTkyNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/331924?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik","html_url":"https://github.com/tmysik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-08T07:11:06Z","updated_at":"2022-10-08T07:11:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@junichi11 Nothing to thank for, really.
