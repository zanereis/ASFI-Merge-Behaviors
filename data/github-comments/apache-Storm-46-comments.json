I think it would be great to have more people look at it, but unless they are blocking issues I would prefer that we file follow up JIRA for them, and get this in so I don't have to keep maintaining it.</p>\n\n<p>    I am +1.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612450628/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/62758258","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/121#issuecomment-62758258","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/121","id":62758258,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNzU4MjU4","user":{"login":"harshach","id":38649,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NjQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38649?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach","html_url":"https://github.com/harshach","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-12T17:35:27Z","updated_at":"2014-11-12T20:20:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I am +1.
