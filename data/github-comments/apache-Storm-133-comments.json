The code is a bit complex.  When debugging these in the past the tests use simulated time, which is a great thing it lets us run tests that would take a long time very quickly, but to make it work properly there are some critical points where we wait for the simulated cluster to be idle.  Typically we see timeouts happen here, waiting for the entire cluster to stop.  But for some reason on really slow hardware, that I don't totally understand yet, this does not always happen. and increasing the timeout does not always induce it to be in that state.</p>\n\n<p>    I am +1 on merging this in, but I am not totally sure that it will \"fix\" the problem.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612629542/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/155434976","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/870#issuecomment-155434976","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/870","id":155434976,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NTQzNDk3Ng==","user":{"login":"revans2","id":3441321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDEzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3441321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2","html_url":"https://github.com/revans2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-10T14:29:27Z","updated_at":"2015-11-10T14:29:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@danielschonfeld Yes we needs something like that.

In doing so, having only one single thread that goes to sleep constantly why submitting the required flush to a global ExecutorService that will take care of the *<b>all</b>* the flushing needed by all bolts/spouts on a single worker JVM.</p>\n\n<p>    In your implementation we still have a thread per DisruptorQueue doing pretty much the same thing as before, but instead of doing the flushes on the same thread, we split the tasks into a multi-threaded approach and try to do it faster that way.  That's not what I had intended with the above example.</p>\n\n<p>    I'd love to hear your thoughts on
