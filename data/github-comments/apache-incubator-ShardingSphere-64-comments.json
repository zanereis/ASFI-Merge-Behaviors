Hello, I am using shardingsphere3.1.0. In #1944,  it has solved the problem of not loading the schema when loading all the tables, but it also does not consider the schema when loading all the columns of the table in `TableMetaDataLoader`. When using the oracle database, if the oracle user has multiple schema view permissions, it will get all the columns of the same name table, it will also make the system start slower. \r\n```java\r\nprivate List<ColumnMetaData> getColumnMetaDataList(final Connection connection, final String catalog, final String actualTableName) throws SQLException {\r\n        List<ColumnMetaData> result = new LinkedList<>();\r\n        Collection<String> primaryKeys = getPrimaryKeys(connection, catalog, actualTableName);\r\n        try (ResultSet resultSet = connection.getMetaData().getColumns(catalog, null, actualTableName, null)) {\r\n            while (resultSet.next()) {\r\n                String columnName = resultSet.getString(\"COLUMN_NAME\");\r\n                String columnType = resultSet.getString(\"TYPE_NAME\");\r\n                result.add(new ColumnMetaData(columnName, columnType, primaryKeys.contains(columnName)));\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        return result;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nIs it possible to add `connection.getSchema()`  as the second parameter in `getColumns `as well?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/526085641/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/526095299","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/2925#issuecomment-526095299","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/2925","id":526095299,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNjA5NTI5OQ==","user":{"login":"sunbufu","id":14866067,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODY2MDY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14866067?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunbufu","html_url":"https://github.com/sunbufu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunbufu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunbufu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunbufu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunbufu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunbufu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunbufu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunbufu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunbufu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunbufu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-29T09:01:55Z","updated_at":"2019-08-29T11:51:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Maybe we should check `server.yml`'s character encoding.

want to clarify our current transaction scope.\r\n\r\n1.support distribute transaction in one ShardingConnection. \r\n2.support distribute transaction using local transaction api. \r\n3.not support distribute transaction in multiple sharding connections. \r\n4.not support distribute transaction in JTA way.\r\n\r\nit seems that you're trying to do some work on `4.` point, in my opinion, the example code can be only supported by JTA, but this is not what we want to integrate currently.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/526440191/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/526449536","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/pull/2934#issuecomment-526449536","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/2934","id":526449536,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNjQ0OTUzNg==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-30T04:19:08Z","updated_at":"2019-09-03T11:04:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"##
