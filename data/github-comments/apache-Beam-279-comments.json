all comments addressed:\r\n\r\n* Kept the default codepath of TextIO and AvroIO unchanged - i.e. still calling WriteFiles, for update compatibility. Instead, TextIO and AvroIO are simply offering sink() and it is tested in their unit tests, and I marked the dynamic-destinations methods of TextIO and AvroIO deprecated.\r\n* Removed FilenameContext in favor of explicit arguments. Renamed FilenamePolicy to FileNaming. Revamped the way file naming works: see the relevant section in the javadoc - I believe this is the most convenient and fully general way: common cases are easy to do, custom naming is easy to do as well.\r\n* Reverted irrelevant changes\r\n* To your question about watermark - it's outside the scope of this PR, but the watermark will effectively follow the timestamp of the next file to be emitted, where the timestamp is the moment the file was first seen.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/349522161/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/349523584","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3717#issuecomment-349523584","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3717","id":349523584,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0OTUyMzU4NA==","user":{"login":"jkff","id":343722,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MzcyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/343722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff","html_url":"https://github.com/jkff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-06T03:47:17Z","updated_at":"2017-12-06T03:47:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The write part of this is effectively subsumed by https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3817 .

I know that empty splits are valid, that is why I proposed to update the assert condition. In the Elasticsearch case, to figure out that a split is empty, it requires to do the whole scroll request (in the initial split) and then count the elements in all sub-sources slices. So it is a complex operation, so filtering out empty splits in the Source is not worthwhile. Thanks for the 50% figure, that is exactly the empirical threshold that I needed!
