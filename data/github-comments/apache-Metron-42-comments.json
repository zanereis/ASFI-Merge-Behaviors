committed another change.  Everything seems to be working with this additional fix.  Would like @anandsubbu to add his experiences working with this patch.\r\n\r\nThis problem started with #660 .  I added a conditional to make sure that a topology is actually running before trying to stop it and similar logic for starting topologies.  This introduced a subtle dependency in that the \"is running\" conditional depends on the Storm UI/API.  If the Storm UI/API is not running, then it assumes the topology is already stopped.  This is only a problem if the Storm UI/API is stopped before Metron components.\r\n\r\nWe then attempted a fix in #680.  There we added dependencies to `STORM_REST_API-STOP` to ensure that all Metron topologies are stopped prior to the Storm UI.  This is necessary since the Metron MPack uses the Storm API to check the status of topologies before shutting them down.  \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this did not fix the problem, at least not in all cases. We found instances where the Metron MPack was still unable to stop topologies before Kerberization because the Storm UI/API had already been stopped.  \r\n\r\nAfter some sleuthing, it seems that the status checks depend on a process running on port 8744. \r\n I found that the storm component that listens on port 8744 is actually called `STORM_UI_SERVER` by Ambari.  So it is the `STORM_UI_SERVER` component that we need to add the dependencies to.  And this is what I have added in the latest commit. \r\n\r\nI am assuming that this is needed in addition to `STORM_REST_API`, but I am not completely sure. \r\n So I left the existing `STORM_REST_API` dependencies.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/329156502/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/329157341","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/748#issuecomment-329157341","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/748","id":329157341,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyOTE1NzM0MQ==","user":{"login":"anandsubbu","id":20395490,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzk1NDkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20395490?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandsubbu","html_url":"https://github.com/anandsubbu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandsubbu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandsubbu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandsubbu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandsubbu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandsubbu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandsubbu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandsubbu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandsubbu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandsubbu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-13T12:50:54Z","updated_at":"2017-09-13T12:50:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @nickwallen , the latest of you patch works just perfect.

This doesn't change the current paradigm of Zookeeper being the source of truth at all times.\r\n\r\n> Is this a standard way of working between ambari and zookeeper or a new take?\r\n\r\nThere isn't really a standard way of managing configs in Zookeeper in Ambari that I'm aware of. This is mostly fixing a gap in how we handle materializing configs from the properties that are managed via the Ambari interface.\r\n\r\n> I have not found it this morning, but my recollection is we did some documentation around ambari and what we do there, do you plan on putting in something about this for maintainers etc?\r\n\r\nYes, completely agreed. Per my initial PR comments this workflow should definitely be explained so the implications of making config changes from local disk, Ambari, Zookeeper, and the management UI are well understood. I have to look for where we put that. While I'm addressing some other code review comments, if anyone happens to know where off the top of their head, that would be helpful.\r\n\r\n> Do you plan on integrating this into the feature branch yourself? Or were you planning on me doing it?\r\n\r\nThis is backwards compatible with existing config management. The only major change would be around Ambari:\r\n1. actually writing the global config from properties held in the Ambari UI (as opposed to the hard-coded values) and \r\n2. using a patching (additive in nature, overwrite in the event of property conflict) mechanism\r\n3. doing a zk config pull to local disk after any service starts/restarts.\r\n\r\nWhat problems with integration are you expecting? There aren't any new classes introduced.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/329832015/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/329834385","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/760#issuecomment-329834385","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/760","id":329834385,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyOTgzNDM4NQ==","user":{"login":"mmiklavc","id":658443,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODQ0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/658443?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc","html_url":"https://github.com/mmiklavc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-15T16:37:42Z","updated_at":"2017-09-15T16:37:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Just pushed a unit test fix to get the build working again.

Run up full dev and verify you have data flowing through to the indexes\r\n2. Change global config options.\r\n    1. Go into the Ambari management UI and modify any of the following config options. e.g. set the es_clustername property to \"ivebeenchanged\". These are values that end up in global.json and will prompt for a component restart. Restart the components.\r\n        - es.clustername\r\n        - es.ip\r\n        - es.date.format\r\n        - parser.error.topic\r\n        - update.hbase.table\r\n        - update.hbase.cf\r\n        - profiler.client.period.duration\r\n        - profiler.client.period.duration.units\r\n    2. Verify $METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper/global.json now has the new value. For the example above, you would expect to see es.clustername=ivebeenchanged.\r\n    3. Verify Zookeeper contains the new config.\r\n        `$METRON_HOME/bin/zk_load_configs.sh -z $ZOOKEEPER -m DUMP -c GLOBAL`\r\n3. Test changing configs from the command line. The zk config utils has been updated with new backwards compatible features, so we'll test that here.\r\n    1. Change one of the zookeeper configs locally and then try a vanilla config PUSH using the original method. Verify the values made it into zookeeper.\r\n        `${METRON_HOME}/bin/zk_load_configs.sh -i ${METRON_HOME}/config/zookeeper -m PUSH -z $ZOOKEEPER`\r\n    2. Change a config locally and push JUST that config to Zookeeper by using one of the new config loader options. You can then perform a DUMP in a similar manner.\r\n        ```\r\n        # global config only\r\n        $METRON_HOME/bin/zk_load_configs.sh -z $ZOOKEEPER -m PUSH -c GLOBAL -i ${METRON_HOME}/config/zookeeper\r\n        # bro config only\r\n        $METRON_HOME/bin/zk_load_configs.sh -z $ZOOKEEPER -m PUSH -c PARSER -n bro -i ${METRON_HOME}/config/zookeeper\r\n        # take a dump of config\r\n        $METRON_HOME/bin/zk_load_configs.sh -z $ZOOKEEPER -m DUMP -c GLOBAL\r\n        $METRON_HOME/bin/zk_load_configs.sh -z $ZOOKEEPER -m DUMP -c PARSER -n bro\r\n        ```\r\n    3. Try the new JSON patch mechanism with key/value from the command line.  Below are some examples but please feel free to explore other combinations. **Note** - commons cli strips the first outermost pair of quotes from all arguments, so you have to provide escaped quotes twice. Neither \\\"\"bar\"\\\" nor \"\\\"bar\\\"\" will work. You must provide both escaped quotes for string values. \\\"\\\"bar\\\"\\\". Complex objects are a bit easier, but you still have to escape quotes inside the string to get them to parse properly.\r\n        ```\r\n        # global config only - add a new key \"foo\" with simple string value \"bar\"\r\n        $METRON_HOME/bin/zk_load_configs.sh -z $ZOOKEEPER -m PATCH -c GLOBAL -pm ADD -pk foo  -pv \\\"\\\"bar\\\"\\\"\r\n        # global config only - add a new key \"foo\" to the JSON doc root with complex value \"{ \\\"bar\\\" : { \\\"baz\\\" : [ \\\"bazval1\\\", \\\"bazval2\\\" ] } }\"\r\n        $METRON_HOME/bin/zk_load_configs.sh -z $ZOOKEEPER -m PATCH -c GLOBAL -pm ADD -pk \"/foo\"  -pv \"{ \\\"bar\\\" : { \\\"baz\\\" : [ \\\"bazval1\\\", \\\"bazval2\\\" ] } }\"\r\n        # global config only - remove a key altogether\r\n        $METRON_HOME/bin/zk_load_configs.sh -z $ZOOKEEPER -m PATCH -c GLOBAL -pm REMOVE -pk \"/foo\"\r\n        ```\r\n    4. Try the new JSON patch mechanism with a patch file.  Below are some examples but please feel free to explore other combinations. Note that a patch file is a JSON array of individual patches.\r\n        1. Try a single patch from file\r\n        ```\r\n        # Create a single patch that adds a new node. Create file \"/tmp/mypatch.txt\" and add the following JSON array.\r\n        [\r\n            {\r\n                \"op\": \"add\",\r\n                \"path\": \"/you\",\r\n                \"value\": { \"cannot\" : { \"handle\" : [ \"the\", \"flow\" ] } }\r\n            }\r\n        ]\r\n\r\n       # Perform the patch\r\n       $METRON_HOME/bin/zk_load_configs.sh -z $ZOOKEEPER -m PATCH -c GLOBAL -pf /tmp/mypatch.txt\r\n\r\n       # Should result in adding the following to global.json\r\n        \"you\" : {\r\n          \"cannot\" : {\r\n            \"handle\" : [ \"the\", \"flow\" ]\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n       ```\r\n\r\n       2. Try multiple patches in a patch file\r\n       ```\r\n       Create a single patch file that adds multiple nodes. Create file \"/tmp/mygrimespatch.txt\" and add the following JSON array.\r\n       # 2 patches in a single patch file\r\n        [\r\n            {\r\n                \"op\": \"add\",\r\n                \"path\": \"/la\",\r\n                \"value\": { \"jiggy\" : { \"jar\" : { \"jar\" : \"do\" } } }\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                \"op\": \"add\",\r\n                \"path\": \"/carl\",\r\n                \"value\": [ \"poppa\", \"rhymes\" ]\r\n            }\r\n        ]\r\n\r\n        # Perform the patch\r\n        $METRON_HOME/bin/zk_load_configs.sh -z $ZOOKEEPER -m PATCH -c GLOBAL -pf /tmp/mygrimespatch.txt\r\n\r\n       # Should result in adding the following to global.json\r\n        \"la\" : {\r\n          \"jiggy\" : {\r\n            \"jar\" : {\r\n              \"jar\" : \"do\"\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        },\r\n        \"carl\" : [ \"poppa\", \"rhymes\" ]\r\n        ```\r\n4. Enable Kerberos to verify config changes still work on service restarts.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/330310305/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/330319715","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/760#issuecomment-330319715","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/760","id":330319715,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMDMxOTcxNQ==","user":{"login":"mmiklavc","id":658443,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODQ0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/658443?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc","html_url":"https://github.com/mmiklavc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-18T18:47:42Z","updated_at":"2017-09-18T18:47:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I

That is probably more intuitive and easily remembered.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/330348421/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/330527206","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/668#issuecomment-330527206","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/668","id":330527206,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMDUyNzIwNg==","user":{"login":"ottobackwards","id":1111551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTE1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards","html_url":"https://github.com/ottobackwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-19T12:44:33Z","updated_at":"2017-09-19T12:44:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"please mark the jira as done","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/330527206/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/330529609","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/619#issuecomment-330529609","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/619","id":330529609,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMDUyOTYwOQ==","user":{"login":"justinleet","id":5077341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzczNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5077341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet","html_url":"https://github.com/justinleet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-19T12:54:03Z","updated_at":"2017-09-19T12:54:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"As a note, this ticket is slightly impacted by the metaalerts backend ticket (https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/734).

Here are my initial reactions focusing on usability.  I am totally open to knocking some of these out as separate PRs, should that be a better approach.\r\n\r\n### (1) Double Save Required\r\n\r\nA user is required to do a \"double save\" for the changes to hit Zookeeper.  When I click \"Save\" on the \"Storm Settings\" panel, it doesn't actually save anything yet.  I then have to click \"Save\" again on the parser edit panel.  Once I do this \"double save\", I can then see the settings take effect in Zookeeper.  \r\n\r\nThis is counter-intuitive to me.  A button that saves \"Save\" should save things.\r\n\r\n### (2) Unsaved Changes Indicator\r\n\r\nWhen the user changes a field in the \"Storm Settings\" panel, it would be nice to have an indication that there are unsaved changes.  This \"unsaved change indicator\" should stick around until we actually push the changes to Zookeeper.  I should not be able to exit the panel without a warning, if I have unsaved changes.  Right now, I can close the panel and lose all of my changes.  \r\n\r\nIn this case, I think this is important because the \"Save\" and \"Cancel\" buttons show up \"below the fold\" and are not visible unless the user scrolls down.  On my first pass, I found myself making changes on the panel, clicking the X in the top-right corner because this is the only transition that is visible.  I then found that my changes were not saved.\r\n\r\n### (3) What Now?\r\n\r\nOnce the user saves changes on this panel, I think we need to provide some guidance to the user as to what to do next.  As a user I am left wondering; \r\n* What just happened?  \r\n* How do I know that his action was successful?  \r\n* What do I need to do now?\r\n\r\n### (4) Warning about Persistence\r\n\r\nWe should have a warning that indicates under what conditions these settings will not persist.   Right now all we do is dump them in Zk.  So if Zk is restarted, we lose them, right?  Whatever does actually happen should be made clear to the user.\r\n\r\n### (5) Reset to Defaults\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to have a \"Reset to Defaults\" button of some sort.  I wanted to go back to what I had initially.  I tried to do this by erasing the value in each field and then saving.  All this did was set each value to 0, which is not the \"reset to defaults\" that I expected.\r\n\r\n### (6) Blank Fields\r\n\r\nThe `NUM_WORKERS` and `NUM_ACKERS` are blank, unlike all of the other configuration fields.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/330632113/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/330670843","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/737#issuecomment-330670843","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/737","id":330670843,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMDY3MDg0Mw==","user":{"login":"merrimanr","id":311928,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTkyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/311928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr","html_url":"https://github.com/merrimanr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-19T20:55:58Z","updated_at":"2017-09-19T20:55:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you for the feedback @nickwallen.  \r\n\r\nOn points 1-3 and 5, these could be applied to any panel in the management UI.  They all work the same.  My opinion is that correct design in this case is somewhat subjective:  what may be intuitive to you may not be intuitive to someone else and vice-versa.  That being said, I think a discussion thread is needed to sort out the right way to do it.\r\n\r\nOn point 4, zookeeper data is persisted across zookeeper restarts so this is not an issue.  If the write to zookeeper fails you will get an error in the UI.  Did you mean parser restart in Ambari?\r\n\r\nOn point 6, this is a problem with the backend but I don't mind fixing it here since it's a small change.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/330670843/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/330673144","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/694#issuecomment-330673144","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/694","id":330673144,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMDY3MzE0NA==","user":{"login":"merrimanr","id":311928,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTkyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/311928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr","html_url":"https://github.com/merrimanr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-19T21:04:32Z","updated_at":"2017-09-19T21:04:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The latest commit merges in master and also refactors this endpoint into the AlertService and AlertController classes that were recently accepted into master.

As refreshes happened the checkboxes would disappear and be replaced by new results but that that field would constantly grow because they were never unchecked on the previous page. It was benign before this PR but is now causing a lot of duplicate REST requests.  We need to figure out the right way to clear these when a bulk action finishes but there is also another issue.\r\n\r\nAs I was testing for this I realized when I set the refresh rate to a high rate I had to click quickly or the page would change and I would lose my selections.  What @iraghumitra mentions above is a pause while the REST requests are being processed but I think it makes sense to pause even earlier, whenever you have a checkbox checked.  I can obviously get it to work if I pause it but I think that's a better UX.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/331261751/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/331432493","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/762#issuecomment-331432493","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/762","id":331432493,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMTQzMjQ5Mw==","user":{"login":"iraghumitra","id":15019012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDE5MDEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15019012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iraghumitra","html_url":"https://github.com/iraghumitra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iraghumitra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iraghumitra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iraghumitra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iraghumitra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iraghumitra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iraghumitra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iraghumitra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iraghumitra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iraghumitra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-22T12:25:19Z","updated_at":"2017-09-22T12:25:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@merrimanr I uncovered the issue when I was trying to integrate METRON-1189 to METRON-1123. I handled it in PR #768, the fix is to empty the selection list whenever we get new data. This would ensure that previous selections are not lingering around.  But as for selections getting removed due to higher refresh interval, I understand the issue the only option I see is pause refresh if any rows are selected on the UI.
