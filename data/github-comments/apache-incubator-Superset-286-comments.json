Let me do so now:\r\n\r\nI concur 100% with the idea of untangling the `app` references from the rest of the code. The problem we currently face with regards to blueprints is that:\r\n\r\n1. Blueprints cannot currently be nested (see [this issue on Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/593))\r\n2. Flask-AppBuilder (FAB) currently leverages blueprints internally.\r\n\r\nWere we to move entirely to blueprints being defined in Superset, that would have substantial implications for the extent that we can leverage FAB in endpoints without either reworking FAB internals or adding the ability to nest blueprints to Flask. As we've been building out `/api/v1`, we've leveraged FAB's base classes, especially for GET endpoints.\r\n\r\nHow would you recommend reconciling this problem?\r\n\r\nI think that @dpgaspar's suggestion for adding a `register_views` function to the `manager.py` files is a possible resolution - this would provide an API similar to blueprint functionality that could be leveraged in `app.py`.

I know some of the use cases were already discussed in the cartel meetings, but since this will be a big change, it would be nice to get feedback from current superset users to make sure the designs cover their use cases. \r\n\r\nCan you also add details about what the migration strategy should be for existing superset deployments that have tabs? Once we switch over all of the existing queries in tabs will be lost right?, so we'll need to do some work to encourage users to save their queries because tabs will be going away. Are their ways to have a smoother transition, maybe an option to have warnings in the app before people switch over?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/588051070/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/588172869","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/9133#issuecomment-588172869","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/9133","id":588172869,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4ODE3Mjg2OQ==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-19T11:25:53Z","updated_at":"2020-02-20T09:12:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9133?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#9133](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9133?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/commit/f3b310c3e96555dcba48f481691dfb3ec563b8c7?src=pr&el=desc) will **increase** coverage by `0.08%`.\n> The diff coverage is `88.88%`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9133/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&token=KsB0fHcx6l&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9133?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@            Coverage Diff             @@\n##           master    #9133      +/-   ##\n==========================================\n+ Coverage   59.08%   59.16%   +0.08%     \n==========================================\n  Files         372      372              \n  Lines       11926    11935       +9     \n  Branches     2920     2927       +7     \n==========================================\n+ Hits         7046     7061      +15     \n+ Misses       4698     4694       -4     \n+ Partials      182      180       -2\n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9133?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [...frontend/src/dashboard/reducers/getInitialState.js](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9133/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-c3VwZXJzZXQtZnJvbnRlbmQvc3JjL2Rhc2hib2FyZC9yZWR1Y2Vycy9nZXRJbml0aWFsU3RhdGUuanM=) | `0% <ø> (ø)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [superset-frontend/src/featureFlags.ts](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9133/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-c3VwZXJzZXQtZnJvbnRlbmQvc3JjL2ZlYXR1cmVGbGFncy50cw==) | `91.66% <100%> (+0.75%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [...rontend/src/SqlLab/components/ShareSqlLabQuery.jsx](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9133/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-c3VwZXJzZXQtZnJvbnRlbmQvc3JjL1NxbExhYi9jb21wb25lbnRzL1NoYXJlU3FsTGFiUXVlcnkuanN4) | `93.54% <80%> (-6.46%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [superset-frontend/src/SqlLab/components/Link.tsx](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9133/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-c3VwZXJzZXQtZnJvbnRlbmQvc3JjL1NxbExhYi9jb21wb25lbnRzL0xpbmsudHN4) | `93.75% <93.75%> (ø)` | |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9133?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9133?src=pr&el=footer).

Would that request stall and wait for a connection to be available or instantly fail?\r\n\r\nFinally, although this may be tangental to the work here, a `CappedDistributedPool` would be extremely useful for us, especially if it capped connections (essentially currently active queries) by both user and analytics db.

There are other ongoing efforts to set up user feedback channels.\r\n\r\nMigration is an important part of this work, since this has such a large impact on users. My proposal as outlined in the SIP is to give each user a button to switch to a tabless UI. Until the tabless UI is deemed \"stable\", there will be an option to switch back to tabs, with your tab state kept intact. Before you decide to go tabless, we can have a message describing the change to the user. We will need to explain that saving queries is the best way to avoid lost work, but you will also be able to use the sqllab history feature or your browser history to find past queries.\r\n\r\n@robdiciuccio \r\n\r\nI think you're correct regarding state management. The way I'm thinking of this change is to use the existing tab ID in the same way that you're describing a unique session ID. I think migrating to UUIDs or something similar is a good idea.

(I also recognize that folks have iterated on the proposal based on feedback, and I appreciate it :))\r\n\r\nA few additional questions I have:\r\n(1) Will users have the option to flip back to the tabbed version if they don't like the tabless version?\r\n(2) If most users choose not to migrate, and/or if they flip back, what will we do then? I assume our goal with this transition period is to ensure that we're making the experience better for users, so I'd like a clear process and commitment to address major points of feedback if we find that most people are opting out of this. \r\n(3) What's the value proposition for the user? As context, tabs are a heavily-used feature in our deployment, though people also have frustrations with it. Ideally we'll be able to say why/how this is a net improvement for users. Right now, to me it seems like there's an idea of a much better experience in the long-term but this is an intermediate step that doesn't add clear value for users that creates work/requires users to deal with change. In general, I think we should ensure that when we require people to migrate, the benefits should clearly outweigh the costs and for me right now this isn't super clear. So I'd love to have this spelled out in terms that users can understand (e.g. -- does this solve the problem of losing in-progress work when local storage is cleared? Does it make it easier to access the in-progress work?)\r\n(4) If the added value isn't clear, then what are things we could add/modify to this proposal so that it does? For example -- making it easier to find saved queries and/or your query history; automatically adding each new tab you create to your saved queries; etc. \r\n(5) Can you help me understand whether the proposed will have any regressions relative to the current experience / make sure that the proposal will meet the use cases people have for tabs today? Mainly, people use tabs as a way to (1) organize their work and (2) save in-progress work. A common scenario is that someone may have two or more different subject areas they are running ad hoc analysis on, and that they are working on over a period of days or even weeks/months. I'm not 100% certain after reading your proposal (and its modifications) a few times, so I'd appreciate your help.\r\n(6) If this is a necessary step for the long-term plan, and that's our primary/only reason taking this step (e.g. if this middle step isn't a clearly better experience for users but we're doing it because it's our only way to transition to the ultimate experience), then I'd like clarity/to first vote on what the long-term plan is. \r\n\r\nAlso, apologies that I didn't send this sooner -- I had a lengthy comment half-written that I lost :(","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/588372885/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/588373465","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/9077#issuecomment-588373465","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/9077","id":588373465,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4ODM3MzQ2NQ==","user":{"login":"willbarrett","id":1779034,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzkwMzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1779034?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willbarrett","html_url":"https://github.com/willbarrett","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willbarrett/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willbarrett/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willbarrett/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willbarrett/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willbarrett/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willbarrett/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willbarrett/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willbarrett/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willbarrett/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-19T18:30:21Z","updated_at":"2020-02-19T18:30:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@john-bodley My understanding here is a little fuzzy too, so I'll let @dpgaspar correct me if I'm wrong.

I think I can address all of these, but let me know if I missed anything.\r\n\r\n1) In short, yes. This is addressed in the migration section and in my other comment above.\r\n\r\n2) A goal of allowing users to switch back is for them to be comfortable with the change. You're right that users could potentially choose not to switch, but I don't think anyone can offer an answer to that at this stage. We'll need to see what happens, gather feedback, and understand why users have made their choice before we can respond effectively. It may just be an issue of messaging, or a problem with the implementation, a missing feature people need, or something else entirely.\r\n\r\n3) I admit that \"remove tabs\" doesn't sound like it has value for users, but nestled within that proposal is \"support web browser navigation patterns\", which offers a lot of value. Web browsers have more effective methods of organization and navigation than are available in SQL Lab. Many users we've spoken with have a knee-jerk reaction against removing tabs initially, but conclude that it is a good change after further reflection. I agree that the benefits should be demonstrated to outweigh the costs before users would be required to switch, which is the motivation for the migration strategy. The language around that could use some clarification though, so I'll work on that.\r\n\r\n4) I think removing tabs has sufficient value on its own. Saving your query automatically may be warranted, but it may also clutter users' saved query lists with work that wasn't meant to be saved. Maybe a list view of your SQL Lab \"sessions\" could serve that purpose? An advantage of the migration strategy is that if such changes are necessary, we can build them while continuing to user-test the tabless SQL Lab in parallel.\r\n\r\n5) I recommend saving your query if it's something you'll be working on for an extended period of time, even if we don't remove tabs. An issue with tabs is they appear to be persistent but they are actually quite brittle and unstable. As for organization, native browser tabs and windows will offer better features than the current UI does. A unique URL for each session also allows using other means of organization such as browser bookmarks, spreadsheets or other documents.\r\n\r\n6) While this is a necessary step for the long-term plan, I also think that SQL Lab would function better without tabs than with tabs, today. Discussions regarding the long-term plan should happen in [SIP-34](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/8976).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/588477832/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/588492579","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/9171#issuecomment-588492579","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/9171","id":588492579,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4ODQ5MjU3OQ==","user":{"login":"nytai","id":10255196,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjU1MTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10255196?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai","html_url":"https://github.com/nytai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-19T21:57:50Z","updated_at":"2020-02-19T21:57:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@suddjian These are the fields for the `/dashboard/:id` endpoint https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/master/superset/views/dashboard/api.py#L144\r\n\r\nThis is the `/related/:col_name` endpoint https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/master/superset/views/base_api.py#L132","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/588492579/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/588494060","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/9171#issuecomment-588494060","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/9171","id":588494060,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4ODQ5NDA2MA==","user":{"login":"nytai","id":10255196,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjU1MTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10255196?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai","html_url":"https://github.com/nytai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-19T22:01:29Z","updated_at":"2020-02-19T22:01:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Seems like the related endpoint is just using `str(col)` which is configured in FAB, I believe.

We ran some in-depth research on Superset with users at our company, and this was one of the key painpoints (losing work) that came up that contributed to a lot of mistrust in Superset. In a world where people are used to working with things like google docs (and honestly even pre-cloud word autosaved), I feel like the baseline expectation is that all in-progress work is saved automatically. \r\n\r\nThat's why re: #5 I understand this brittleness with tabs and have been advocating for addressing it for a while now. Even though we provide the same suggestion you do to our users, every time the local storage gets cleared for some reason or another, we get frustrated and surprised users complaining that their work has been lost. \r\n\r\nSo I really like your suggestion of providing a list view of your SQL lab sessions (assuming that your sessions get auto-saved, which I think it would since we generate a unique session id each time?) -- it seems like it would address both the permanence issue AND also make it easier to manage the clutter of your work. (I think that searching through browsing history is a stretch and unlikely to be discoverable). If we have this, it seems like a complete solution and one that seems more clearly like an improvement. \r\n\r\n(6) OK. Especially with the careful consideration and process we have for migration, I feel comfortable with moving that conversation outside of this SIP. \r\n\r\nThanks for taking the time to comment and iterate! I shared this proposal with a couple of users here and they appreciated the thought that was put into it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/588568928/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/588633846","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/9160#issuecomment-588633846","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/9160","id":588633846,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4ODYzMzg0Ng==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-20T06:35:06Z","updated_at":"2020-02-20T06:35:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I think it should work though we test against 3.6 still.

A few questions (for you or the community):\r\n\r\n- What was the original rationale in moving plugins out into their own repo(s)?\r\n- How are you thinking about exposing Pandas data transformation functionality to the plugins via the `/api/v1/query` endpoint. Will there be a whitelisted set of transformation methods that can be called? Will it support chaining these transformations?\r\n- Should we rename the `/api/v1/query` endpoint to something less ambiguous?\r\n- For i18n, I realize this is bigger issue than just visualizations, but have you looked into libraries like [globalize](https://github.com/globalizejs/globalize) or other [CLDR](http://cldr.unicode.org/)-based solutions?\r\n- Will migration to the new plugin architecture simply be handled by the `useLegacy` frontend flag?

All\r\ncharts were shipped with every release of Superset. There was no easy way\r\nto get rid of them.\r\n* The chart code with no owner (after the PR was merged and the chart\r\nauthor abandoned them) became dead code that nobody owns in the main repo,\r\nand the list kept growing. Maintaining the \"visualizations\" folder at that\r\ntime was a monumental tasks.\r\n* Developers have custom needs and keep asking to add more types of charts.\r\nSome are very specific and debatable whether that is useful for anyone\r\nelse.\r\n* Very difficult to test the charts.\r\n\r\nBreaking them into independent packages and lighter weight repositories allow:\r\n\r\n* more stable `incubator-superset` and less code to maintain. If a chart\r\nwill only be used by single organization, then the entire community should\r\nnot have to maintain it.\r\n* chances to deprecate uncommon charts by dropping the plugin from the main\r\nbundle, but still make them available as packages for developers to install\r\nthem into their own deployment.\r\n* enforced decoupling. remove hacks for special handlings of certain charts.\r\n* less arguments about adding certain charts or not.\r\n* visual inspection of every PR with storybook and easier maintenance.\r\n* developer productivity: reduced ci build time, smaller codebase, able to\r\napply more strict linting rules.\r\n\r\n> One key part of the embeddable project is to move towards *chart plugins system*, which we can register only necessary charts for superset or register custom ones as wish. This will give more flexibility to the developers to customize their superset instances (making it more lightweight, include-only-needed, or include custom vis type) as well as improve maintainability of the superset codebase (instead of hosting every visualization in the main repo). In order to do that, we aim to split the chart types (i.e. most of the things in src/visualizations) into one or more plugins (npm packages), independent from superset.

This raises a lot of great points and cleared many of my doubts.\r\n\r\nI’m still new to Superset, so apologies if I missed some historical context. Just to be clear, what I meant in [#8638](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8638) was to **temporarily** move plugins and their registries back to `incubator-superset` **until things are more settled**——plugin API matured, core plugin quality under control, and [the big UI overhaul (SIP-34)](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/8976) finally starting to take shape.\r\n\r\nMy biggest concern was it might take a lot of efforts to get there and having to sync code between multiple repos slows the whole process down. Even if we can solve the linking issue with a custom `npm` command, people still need to make (and review) two (maybe three) PRs whenever the registry or control panel API needs to change. Overall, the overhead the 3-repo structure imposes _right now_ seemed overweight the potential benefits it may bring in the future—considering there might be other solutions to achieve the same goal.\r\n\r\nIn general, I agree it makes a lot of sense to have optional visualizations as separate packages and in their own repo. Future Superset admins may even install a plugin from the web UI so it's only natural to do this. But for core visualizations, I had doubts. Superset as a software needs to ship with some visualizations anyway and having the source code in one place makes it easier for developers to start writing their own plugins or upgrading an existing one——simpler dev env setup, easier navigation, better git history... many of which not easily replaceable by npm scripts. Most OSS with a plugin system took this approach, in additional to Redash and Metabase mentioned before, think [WordPress](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/tree/master/wp-content/plugins), [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages), and [Strapi](https://github.com/strapi/strapi/tree/master/packages). \r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n@kristw , to mitigate some of the original concerns, maybe we can take following actions (if we haven't):\r\n\r\n- Officially freeze the `visualization` folder, no PRs will be accepted or reviewed until we clean things up and plugin API stabilized\r\n- Require all new visualizations to have unit test that do not depend on Superset backend API\r\n- Place additional more strict `.eslintrc` to the folders of migrated components.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we can also have a frontend \"monorepo\" within `incubator-superset`, publishing `superset-ui` and \"official\" plugins as separate packages but track them under the same git repo with the backend code. This way embeddable charts also get to stay on the roadmap.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/589912159/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/589936217","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/8699#issuecomment-589936217","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/8699","id":589936217,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4OTkzNjIxNw==","user":{"login":"villebro","id":33317356,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzE3MzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33317356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro","html_url":"https://github.com/villebro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-22T09:21:09Z","updated_at":"2020-02-22T09:21:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks

It looks like a step towards getting all API responses to have a standard shape. One thing that I would change a tiny bit would be the response shape. Enums are awesome for this sort of thing, but one thing I would add would be an error \"code\" which would simply be an `int` which can then be taken action upon by the consumer. There's also the potential for having multiple errors in a given response (think API validation where several keys are required).

That seemed like a non-starter to me, so I didn't consider it. If you have a way to resolve this, then I'd be happy to hear it!\r\n\r\nFor examples of fragmented error handling, in SQL Lab we render alerts based on error messages injected inside the query object (as well as the poorly defined `link` parameter): https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/291306392443a5a0d0e2ee0cc4a95d37c56d4589/superset-frontend/src/SqlLab/components/ResultSet.jsx#L201-L212\r\nbut in Charts we render them based off the `chartAlert` param (in a completely different component too):\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/291306392443a5a0d0e2ee0cc4a95d37c56d4589/superset-frontend/src/chart/Chart.jsx#L136-L143\r\n\r\n@craig-rueda:\r\n\r\nI totally agree with an `errors` array inside the structure, that makes a bunch of sense. We'll need to consider what the default UI experience is (multiple alerts? merging errors?) but I think it'll be worth it.\r\n\r\nOne thing I don't agree with is using an error code as opposed to an enum. This is for two reasons:\r\n- The error code in the response would be easily confused with a http status code that's already an int.\r\n- By using an Enum, we can both provide some idea of what the error is to the user, but also provide a unique string for searching error resolutions online. Instead of getting a `Superset Error 1432` you'd get a `Superset Error PRESTO_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` which i think is much more readable and could save the extra trouble of mapping a code to resolutions online. The enum provides additional value to the error message as an error like this might include the message: `Presto encountered an unknown issue when running this query. Please try again later.` and the enum specifies a more technical error","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/590549191/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/590550571","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/8976#issuecomment-590550571","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/8976","id":590550571,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5MDU1MDU3MQ==","user":{"login":"ktmud","id":335541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNTU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/335541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktmud","html_url":"https://github.com/ktmud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktmud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktmud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktmud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktmud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktmud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktmud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktmud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktmud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktmud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-24T21:11:54Z","updated_at":"2020-02-24T21:11:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"🎉 🎉  Congratulation on passing the SIP!
