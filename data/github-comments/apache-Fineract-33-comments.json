@vidakovic Interesting question re what we should do wrt tests if we provide multiple clients\r\n\r\nI suppose there are three different reasons why we want to test:\r\n\r\n1. Test the Fineract server side business logic. This is what our existing Integration Test base is focused on.\r\n\r\n2. Test the API spec itself. We clearly don't have tests for this - and as @vorburger has found that some of the API specs don't currently generate valid client code, so the spec is broken.\r\n\r\n3. Test a specific language implementation of the client generated from spec - i.e. does the TypeScript version work, does the Java version work etc\r\n\r\nTo avoid maintaining a huge amount of duplicate tests, I think it would make sense to try to cover as much of 1 through 2 as possible. So actually using the generated clients to exercise the business logic, instead of e.g. some custom code as currently in Integration Tests or directly exercising the tests against Spring Boot. That way we are both testing one of the generated clients, validity of the API spec, and the business logic all in one go. But then we still need to see how to cover 3. \r\n\r\nMy view is that to focus our efforts, majority of the tests should be written against one of the generated clients only (in my view Java as that will align with most of the contributors' skill base). For the other generated clients, we should agree a very basic test suite (e.g. login / trigger one API / check response) to confirm the client works, but not to build a full functional test suite for them. \r\n\r\nJust my thoughts... happy to discuss.

During a normal build it maybe doesn't make much of a difference for devs, but if you execute e. g. \"./gradlew :integration-tests:test\" then Cargo doesn't shutdown for some reason and leaves a zombie process (just found that out yesterday). And I have a hunch that Spring tests would run faster.\r\n\r\n> b) forget about this approach and abandon this PR and just close [FINERACT-764](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FINERACT-764) (I don't actually really mind either)\r\n> \r\n> c) have some mixed form - keep testing the WAR with the Cargo plugin for some basic tests, but move other ITs to this style.\r\n\r\nc) Realistically, we will probably take a moment or two to refactor all integration tests. So for a while we would be probably running in a \"hybrid\" mode. Maybe we could do this migration together with moving towards Fineract Client usage.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/717137108/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/717139983","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/1422#issuecomment-717139983","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/1422","id":717139983,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxNzEzOTk4Mw==","user":{"login":"vidakovic","id":380079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MDA3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/380079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic","html_url":"https://github.com/vidakovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-27T10:21:52Z","updated_at":"2020-10-27T10:21:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@vorburger I would merge as is, can't really hurt.
