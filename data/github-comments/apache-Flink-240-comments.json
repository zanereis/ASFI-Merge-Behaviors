I need confirm some points here with you before I getting start again with this issue.\r\n\r\n1. I have to create an actual quickstart project. Hmm, Is this a project or a maven module ? And where do I created for that ? If it is a project(sounds weird because all in flink belongs to maven module), I think I should use command in bash to create this project. And the bash command is ```curl https://flink.apache.org/q/quickstart.sh | bash```. As the position for this project, Is it suitable put it to ```flink-end-to-end-tests``` folder ?\r\n\r\n2. Verification issue. verify that no core dependencies are contained in the jar file. I do not understand very well here. Is that mean we should check the jar file that no flink-core dependencies in the jar file since there is already have that in flink cluster set up.  If we still have flink-core dependency in the jar file, that would cause the jar file very big size.  I understand correct ? So, we need have a check here.\r\n\r\n3. The job could fail outright, yet the test will still succeed. I also do not understand very well. This means I need make the job ```StreamExecutionEnvironment#enableCheckpointing``` in code ?\r\n\r\nIf I am wrong, please helps me out here.

You should create a project _within the test_. This project must **not** be based on `https://flink.apache.org/q/quickstart.sh`, is has to be created with the archetype that is installed locally by `flink-quickstarts`. For this you will have to use the maven commands as outlined in the [documentation](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-master/quickstart/java_api_quickstart.html).\r\n2. Correct, you should verify that none of the core flink classes are contained in the jar. The only classes that should be contained are those of the project.\r\n3. No, this is not related to checkpointing. The point of this test is to ensure that job-jars created by a quickstart project actually work when submitted to a flink cluster. For example, they have to contain the job classes, like `StreamingJob`, as otherwise the job will fail outright since there's nothing to run. So you have to verify that the job was successfully run, the easiest way being to write some data to some file (like the WordCount tests), and verifying the contents.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/380052231/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/380068785","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4943#issuecomment-380068785","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4943","id":380068785,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MDA2ODc4NQ==","user":{"login":"shashank734","id":6039149,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMzkxNDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6039149?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shashank734","html_url":"https://github.com/shashank734","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shashank734/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shashank734/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shashank734/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shashank734/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shashank734/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shashank734/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shashank734/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shashank734/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shashank734/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-10T11:41:06Z","updated_at":"2018-04-10T11:41:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@StephanEwen Are these changes part of 1.5 or 1.4, Do you have any example how I can use this with states and CEP?

for opening this PR @DmitryKober!\r\n\r\nI had a quick look over the changes and there are a few things that can be fixed such as:\r\n- reverting all unnecessary changes such as changing import order or white space changes\r\n- merging all commits into a single commit\r\n- check if the changes to `TupleTypeInfo` are required\r\n- check if we can add this feature without adding a dependency to `flink-java`\r\n\r\nYou can update the PR by force pushing into your Github branch.\r\n\r\nThanks,
