I am not sure if it can really be called a normal numeric error.\nFor instance, if I feed a image of duck into these two models, the predicted top 5 classes are just slightly different:\n\n```\nCaffe's output of the top 5 targets:\nrank 1(prob=0.9066): n01847000 drake\nrank 2(prob=0.0348): n01855672 goose\nrank 3(prob=0.0158): n02018207 American coot, marsh hen, mud hen, water hen, Fulica americana\nrank 4(prob=0.0092): n01855032 red-breasted merganser, Mergus serrator\nrank 5(prob=0.0055): n01806143 peacock\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nMxnet's output of the top 5 targets:\nrank 1(prob=0.8810): n01847000 drake\nrank 2(prob=0.0369): n01855672 goose\nrank 3(prob=0.0153): n02018207 American coot, marsh hen, mud hen, water hen, Fulica americana\nrank 4(prob=0.0120): n01806143 peacock\nrank 5(prob=0.0083): n01855032 red-breasted merganser, Mergus serrator\n```\n\nIn another case that I use a chick image, the outputs look more different:\n\n```\nCaffe's output of the top 5 targets:\nrank 1(prob=0.2092): n01580077 jay\nrank 2(prob=0.1190): n02120079 Arctic fox, white fox, Alopex lagopus\nrank 3(prob=0.1132): n01537544 indigo bunting, indigo finch, indigo bird, Passerina cyanea\nrank 4(prob=0.0893): n02326432 hare\nrank 5(prob=0.0614): n01514859 hen\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nMxnet's output of the top 5 targets:\nrank 1(prob=0.3326): n01580077 jay\nrank 2(prob=0.1572): n02120079 Arctic fox, white fox, Alopex lagopus\nrank 3(prob=0.0922): n02442845 mink\nrank 4(prob=0.0514): n02326432 hare\nrank 5(prob=0.0382): n02441942 weasel\n\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/242973137/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/242973439","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/1591#issuecomment-242973439","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1591","id":242973439,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0Mjk3MzQzOQ==","user":{"login":"zihaolucky","id":4514568,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTQ1Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4514568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihaolucky","html_url":"https://github.com/zihaolucky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihaolucky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihaolucky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihaolucky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihaolucky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihaolucky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihaolucky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihaolucky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihaolucky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihaolucky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-28T12:57:32Z","updated_at":"2016-08-28T12:57:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for your reply and +1 for Java APIs. \n\nThe model file is said to be language agnostic, so I trained my model in Python and write a predict function in Java as below to deploy into the production environment.\n\n``` Java\npublic void predict(NDArrayIter dataiter, int batchSize) {\n\n    SGD opt = new SGD(0.0001f, 0.9f, 0.000f, 0.0f, null);\n    Uniform uniform = new Uniform(0.1f);\n    Context[] ctx = new Context[1];\n    ctx[0] = Context.cpu(0);\n    FeedForward model = FeedForward.load(\"prefix\", 10, ctx, 200, 32, opt, uniform, 32, false);\n\n    model.predict(dataiter, batchSize);\n}\n```\n\nBut I stuck at creating an NDArrayIter?

There exists a problem if we just depend on a state variable to decide whether to record (as the current implementation of TurnTracerOn/Off). The tracer may only record the end of operation execution because the execution is asynchronous.

Choose to record symbolic operations or all operations.\n2. Record certain rounds of execution in the middle of running procedure to exclude some deviation like booting device time and avoid large trace file. \n\n**Why symbolic operation is special from other operation?**\n- symbolic operation is those core operations we intend to focus on. Too much operations will make the trace a mess and large trace file.\n- symbolic operation can be separated out. it's only passed by graph_executor.\n- symbolic operation have the concept of `round` or `iteration` obviously by executor.forward/backward. As for other operations, you don't know which iteration it belong to because of asynchronisation of operation execution.\n\n**API Design**\n\n**Env Variables**\n\nMXNET_PROFILER_SYMBOLIC: profiler will be turned on to record only symbolic operation.\nMXNET_PROFILER_ALL: profiler will be turned on to record all operation.\n\nBut if we only have these two env variables, we cannot achieve the second goal. So we need to point out which execution round we want to record explicitly.\n\n**Python APIs**\n\n```\nturn_tracer_on()/turn_tracer_off()\n```\n\nTurn on/off the profiler to record execution during the interval.\n\n```\nmodel.fit(...num_iterations=None,\n              begin_tracing_iteration=None,\n              end_tracing_iteration=None,...)\n```\n\nIt indicates profiler to record execution from the begin iteration to the end iteration.\n\n`need_tracer` acts as the same role to tell engine which execution round should be recorded. It can be removed from executor api as Tianqi said.\n\nBeside, maybe you want to specify the output filename as an env variable too, right? like MXNET_PROFILER_FILENAME\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/243247378/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/243251411","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/3170#issuecomment-243251411","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/3170","id":243251411,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MzI1MTQxMQ==","user":{"login":"miguelgfierro","id":3491412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTE0MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3491412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelgfierro","html_url":"https://github.com/miguelgfierro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelgfierro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelgfierro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelgfierro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelgfierro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelgfierro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelgfierro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelgfierro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelgfierro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelgfierro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-29T20:49:30Z","updated_at":"2016-08-29T20:49:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"yes, I think that's my next step\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/243251411/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/243307346","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/1452#issuecomment-243307346","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1452","id":243307346,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MzMwNzM0Ng==","user":{"login":"horserma","id":17120259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MTIwMjU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17120259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horserma","html_url":"https://github.com/horserma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horserma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horserma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horserma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horserma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horserma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horserma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horserma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horserma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horserma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-30T01:31:42Z","updated_at":"2016-08-30T01:32:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@tqchen Since I am still confused about this async engine, may I ask you one more question? Like you said before, executor.outputs[0].copyto(mx.cpu()).asnumpy() will force the engine to sync. So if I have two parts in my network, which means two executors, e1 and e2. The whole training process can be described as:\n\n```\ne1.forward(is_train=True)\noutput1 = e1.outputs[0].copyto(mx.cpu()).asnumpy()\n...process output1 and get input2 for e2...\ne2.arg_dict[\"data\"][:] = input2\ne2.forward(is_train=True)\noutput2 = e2.outputs[0].copyto(mx.cpu()).asnumpy()\n...calculate gradients for output2 say grad2...\ne2.backward(mx.ndarray.array(grad2))\ndata_grad = e2.grad_dict[\"data\"].copyto(mx.cpu()).asnumpy() //get gradients for data\n...process data_grad and get grad_output1 for e1...\ne1.backward(mx.ndarray.array(grad_outpu1))\nfor arg in update_list:\n    updater(...)\n```\n\nSo is this the correct way of doing this? Since I used too many copyto(mx.cpu()) to force the sync, would this cause any slow-down? If this is non-optimal, what is the best way to implement this?
