Thank you for writing it up. The proposal looks good to me overall.\r\n\r\nI just have a couple of questions.\r\n\r\n> * When a merge notice is received, the Indexer will attempt to record two memory allocations in its memory usage tracking state:\r\n>    * a fixed amount of heap. This can scale based on some proportion of globalIngestionHeapLimitBytes.\r\n>    * a fixed amount of direct memory, needed for decompression buffers and dictionary conversions. This can scale based on the size in bytes of the fuzzy +1 factor in the familiar (druid.processing.numThreads + druid.processing.numMergeBuffers + 1) * druid.processing.buffer.sizeBytes formula.\r\n\r\nThis sounds like each task needs to reserve some memory up front.

The contrib extensions aren't actively maintained by the Druid committers, and are generally less extensively tested.\r\n\r\nIt can make sense for a new feature to start out as a contrib extension, and potentially migrate to core as it evolves. Examples of this include the Google Cloud Storage extension and the ORC format extension, which started out as contrib extensions and were recently adopted as core extensions.\r\n\r\nFor the Oak-based incremental index, this path could make sense as well, but Druid does not currently provide an extension point for incremental index implementations. To open that as an extension point would first involve discussion/consensus on whether it's a good idea to have that extension point, and there would also be significant design thought/implementation work required.\r\n\r\nGiven those difficulties, I think it makes sense to think about the path to merging Oak-based incremental index as a core feature. For merging a contribution into core, the requirement is essentially: \"Convince Druid committers such that they are willing to take responsibility for and maintain the contribution going forward.\"\r\n\r\nAt the highest level, setting aside implementation details, I think it'd be helpful to see a comparison of performance metrics between Oak incremental index and the existing implementation on a real cluster. \r\n\r\nI would try to set up realistic workloads for native batch ingestion and Kafka indexing service ingestion, and gather metrics for the following:\r\n- Ingestion throughput\r\n- Query performance (realtime tasks like Kafka indexing service tasks can answer queries)\r\n- Index persist performance\r\n\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nSeparately from the incremental index topic, I wonder if OakMap could be used as part of Druid's GroupBy V2 query. There is a class called `ConcurrentGrouper` which is responsible for grouping/aggregating rows off-heap, with concurrent writes. This sounds like an area where OakMap could potentially be beneficial. If you're interested, that could be another worthwhile avenue for investigation.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/506881097/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/506898205","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/7964#issuecomment-506898205","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7964","id":506898205,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNjg5ODIwNQ==","user":{"login":"vogievetsky","id":177816,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzgxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177816?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky","html_url":"https://github.com/vogievetsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-28T22:46:02Z","updated_at":"2019-06-28T22:46:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"awesome,

You are issue number 8000, congratulations 🎆 \r\n\r\n2. I am saddened by the issue your console is having rendering icons\r\n\r\n  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177816/60402652-54d8fa00-9b47-11e9-94e2-cd39d6cf6202.png)]\r\n\r\n  I am guessing you are somehow prevented from loading the icon font? This should be addressed in the newly released Druid 0.15.0 , we upgraded to the latest blueprintjs which no longer uses the icon font.\r\n\r\n3. The segments you have highlighted do not really have 0 rows num_rows is only reported for available segments. This is confusing UI and will be fixed in the next iteration of the web console (in 0.16.0). It will then say `(unknown)`.\r\n\r\n4. The segments you have highlighted are actually the segments you want! Look at the version it is higher. Maybe they are the result of the compaction and they have not been loaded yet?\r\n\r\n5. More info is needed to understand what is going on: by `I started to notice long periods of time when our datasources would not be 100% available` what do you mean by 'long' minutes? hours? days? Also when you say `Eventually these rows get cleaned up` can you be specific on 'Eventually' is it minutes? hours?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/507071244/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/507075878","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/7932#issuecomment-507075878","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7932","id":507075878,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNzA3NTg3OA==","user":{"login":"himanshug","id":246308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjMwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug","html_url":"https://github.com/himanshug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-30T23:24:49Z","updated_at":"2019-06-30T23:24:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I

In particular, we had thought about moving the entire sys schema implementation to the Coordinator and having the Broker send any SQL queries on `sys` over there. Users could also query sys tables on the Coordinator directly if they wanted.\r\n\r\nI like that because, as a user I would like to use the feature introduced by `sys` table but it would be nice if it wasn't at the expense of each broker needing whole bunch of extra memory that I would like to save for real data queries.\r\nRegarding the counter arguments ...\r\n\r\n> It is a somewhat common request from our users to add an option to the Broker to either fail a query, or provide a ....\r\n\r\nWe have a slightly different feature already available. Query context key, \"uncoveredIntervalsLimit\" that can be used in the query to return any intervals not covered by segments that we used to process query. this adds a header in response and user can discard the results. I think it was documented at some point in Query Contexts doc. This should work for many users.\r\nHowever it is not exactly what you pointed. For that, a \"cache\" wouldn't be enough because it could be stale and we wouldn't be able to guarantee whether results are really partial or not. But, I get it that \"good enough\" might be good enough.\r\n\r\n> #6319 contemplates a design for finer-grained loc ...\r\n\r\nsorry, haven't gone through it yet, so don't understand it.\r\n\r\nIn any case, both counter arguments are basically saying that we need the cache at broker for other reasons. I would propose that we don't make cache at broker a prerequisite for `sys` table functionality .. other features might need the cache when there is no other way but me as a user would like to use `sys` without incurring extra memory at broker if possible. \r\n\r\nThat said, if we do decide otherwise then I am fine with Broker getting information from Coordinator instead of directly going to DB for reasons that @gianm mentioned. General expectation from cluster is that data queries should continue to work in case of node failures as much possible not that all features need to work . I wouldn't worry about coordinator being down leading to Broker not having up-to-date response for `sys` table queries , when coordinator is down then new segments are not loaded on historicals (and many other big problems) happen so \"all coordinators down\" is a pretty bad situation anyway which cluster operators would want to resolve as quickly as possible.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/507862581/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/507864123","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/7900#issuecomment-507864123","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7900","id":507864123,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNzg2NDEyMw==","user":{"login":"himanshug","id":246308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjMwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug","html_url":"https://github.com/himanshug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-02T22:12:46Z","updated_at":"2019-07-02T22:12:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Points raised in \"motivation\" are valid, so +1 for the proposal.\r\n\r\nhowever...\r\n\r\n> A new process type, BigIndexer (tentative name), will be added.

We continued the experiments that had started and were presented above under “IncrementalIngestionBenchmark” title. We compare native Druid’s incremental index and newly suggested OakIncrementalIndex (data taken off-heap). The data distribution/generation is exactly as in IncrementalIngestionBenchmark, we just insert more rows.\r\n\r\nThis time we inserted 6 Million rows (about 8GB of data) while giving 24GB RAM. Number 24GB appear as this is almost the lowest number allowing native Druid’s IncrementalIndex to run properly. Even taking into consideration that in IncrementalIngestionBenchmark, the rows come prepared before the benchmark measurement and actually already take big chunk of on-heap memory, x3 memory requirement sounds a lot… Druid’s incremental index gets 24GB on heap memory. OakIncrementalIndex always gets 16GB on-heap and 8GB off-heap (in total 24GB RAM).  The results can be see in the file bellow. The graph shows throughput (number of operations in seconds) so the bigger the better. OakIncrementalIndex performs about twice faster.\r\n\r\n[Ingestion Throughput      6M rows (8GB data) ingested.pdf](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/files/3353954/Ingestion.Throughput.6M.rows.8GB.data.ingested.pdf)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to stress the memory overhead requirement, we have run yet another experiment, this time inserting 7 Million rows, which is up to 9GB data. We gradualy increased the memory requirement and present the throughput as function of total RAM used. Results in the file below. OakIncrementalIndex off-heap memory requirement was always 9GB, as it is what is written there. We have started by giving 24GB of total RAM as this is where OakIncrementalIndex was able to operate, although its throughput was very low. Native Druid’s IncrementalIndex was unable to operate until 28GB of on-heap memory was allowed to be used.\r\n\r\n[Ingestion 9GB data into Druid.pdf](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/files/3353955/Ingestion.9GB.data.into.Druid.pdf)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes the question of metadata memory overhead bother you? Also would you be interested in working with bigger IncrementalIndexes, in order to later have less flushes to disk (persist), causing less merges, and thus higher performance?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/507994908/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/508069743","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/7926#issuecomment-508069743","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7926","id":508069743,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwODA2OTc0Mw==","user":{"login":"acdn-mpreston","id":33030320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDMwMzIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33030320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/acdn-mpreston","html_url":"https://github.com/acdn-mpreston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acdn-mpreston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acdn-mpreston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acdn-mpreston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acdn-mpreston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acdn-mpreston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acdn-mpreston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acdn-mpreston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acdn-mpreston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acdn-mpreston/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-03T12:21:44Z","updated_at":"2019-07-03T12:21:44Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@jihoonson just letting you know that I have tried 0.15.0-incubating and can confirm that this issue does exist there as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/508069743/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/508094452","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/7932#issuecomment-508094452","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7932","id":508094452,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwODA5NDQ1Mg==","user":{"login":"crodier","id":2854874,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTQ4NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2854874?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/crodier","html_url":"https://github.com/crodier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crodier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crodier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crodier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crodier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crodier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crodier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crodier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crodier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crodier/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-03T13:32:03Z","updated_at":"2019-07-03T13:32:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#5344 seems to have it?

context around the potential impact of Oak on Druid's IncrementalIndex:\r\n\r\n1. There are two things that matter at ingestion time: ingestion throughput (for all forms of ingestion) and query latency (for realtime ingestion only -- batch ingest does not serve queries).\r\n2. It looks like you've been doing a lot of testing with really big incremental indexes, but it's more normal in Druid land to have smaller ones. There are a couple of reasons for this. One is that bigger indexes take up more memory, and large amounts of memory aren't always available. Another is that querying bigger indexes takes more time. The way Druid's ingestion works is that periodically, the incremental indexes are persisted to disk in Druid's segment format, which is compressed (smaller) and columnar & indexed (faster to query on a per-row basis). There are also multiple persist files and each can be processed in parallel. Keeping around too many rows in memory can negatively impact query speeds. In other words: having a 5 million row incremental index means that queries on realtime data cannot be faster than however long it takes to process those 5 million rows. This latter point matters for realtime ingestion (where queries happen concurrently with ingestion), and so for understanding the impact there, it'd be important to see how long queries take.\r\n3. For ingestion throughput there are three components that matter: throughput of adding to an incremental index, how long it takes to persist the incremental index to disk, and how long it takes to merge persisted indexes into a final segment at the end of the ingestion cycle. All of them matter, & one reason folks are asking for real-world numbers is to make sure all three of these are being taken into account.\r\n\r\nExperience and query/ingest-rate metrics in a real cluster is the easiest way to validate all of the above, since the system is fairly complex and there are a lot of potential tradeoffs involved between the various components. If you don't have a real-world dataset available maybe try the publicly available tweets dataset from the Twitter Streaming API. We often use it for test clusters. Some resources for that:\r\n\r\n- https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/sample-realtime/overview/GET_statuse_sample\r\n- http://twitter4j.org/en/code-examples.html (look for \"Streaming API\")\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThat all being said, you might also want to look at the potential impact of Oak on Druid's groupBy engine. Check out the ConcurrentGrouper class, which groupBy v2 queries use for parallel aggregation. In particular, check out the `aggregate(KeyType key, int keyHash)` method. It is slicing up a buffer and then synchronizing on each slice, a pretty simple strategy that I am sure could be improved on. Maybe Oak could do better. The code path is somewhat similar to IncrementalIndex: both of them involve grouping by time and dimensions, and aggregating using AggregatorFactories.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/508266279/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/508313373","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/8023#issuecomment-508313373","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8023","id":508313373,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwODMxMzM3Mw==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-04T02:19:21Z","updated_at":"2019-07-04T02:19:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The similar patch for hyperUnique and cardinality aggregators is here: #4720","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/508313373/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/508364025","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/7932#issuecomment-508364025","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7932","id":508364025,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwODM2NDAyNQ==","user":{"login":"himanshug","id":246308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjMwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug","html_url":"https://github.com/himanshug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-04T06:57:45Z","updated_at":"2019-07-04T07:01:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@crodier thanks . ok, I see now. default `FilterOutputStream.write(byte b[], int off, int len)` impl is dumber than it needs to be.\r\nIn this case, Performance degradation is not related to BufferedOutputStream which we never had in that context but due to the use of FilterOutputStream  .

Also no doubts, the system level test/performance benchmark is also important. We try to collect the information about how it should be run to be convincing for the community.\r\n\r\n> It looks like you've been doing a lot of testing with really big incremental indexes, but it's more normal in Druid land to have smaller ones.\r\n\r\nThere is no intention to force Druid to work with big incremental indexes, just wanted to show some cases where Oak advantage is clear. Ingestion (with Oak) on smaller indexes has the same latency/throughput (as with current IncrementalIndex), but takes less memory and gives a potential for a better concurrency if multi-threaded ingestion will be used one day.\r\n\r\n> One is that bigger indexes take up more memory, and large amounts of memory aren't always available.\r\n\r\nOakIncrementalIndex can let you handle more rows with less RAM.\r\n\r\n> Another is that querying bigger indexes takes more time\r\n\r\nWe are currently working on queries speed. Hope to update you soon. What are the expected query times?\r\n\r\n> how long it takes to persist the incremental index to disk, and how long it takes to merge persisted indexes into a final segment at the end of the ingestion cycle.\r\n\r\nThere can be a trade of, assuming all in all you process X bytes of data. It can be persisted in chunks of X/10 and then merged 10 times, or alternatively it can be persisted in big chunks like X/2 and may be merged only twice. I am just exaggerating the numbers, and I am not sure this theory can show better performance. Just something to be checked.\r\n\r\nThank you for pointing on the publicly available dataset.
