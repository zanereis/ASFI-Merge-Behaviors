Good find. I guess the only difference if we set `compression.type` is how we'd react to a future config change. For example, if we initially set `offsets.topic.compression.codec` to snappy and write that to Zk as the topic's `compression.type`, then if we later change `offsets.topic.compression.codec` to gzip, we'd first compress as gzip and then recompress as snappy on writing (unless we change the code to alter the topic configuration). Alternatively, with the change as it is, we'll leave the data compressed according to whatever the current configuration is. That seems preferable to me.\n\nBut actually I'm a little confused. Isn't the `compression.type` for this topic explicitly set to `uncompressed` on that line above that @omkreddy points to above? Wouldn't that mean that we'd decompress before writing even with this patch?

I had been doing dynamic config.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/220244120/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/220249777","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1394#issuecomment-220249777","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1394","id":220249777,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMDI0OTc3Nw==","user":{"login":"onurkaraman","id":529976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyOTk3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/529976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman","html_url":"https://github.com/onurkaraman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-19T07:37:56Z","updated_at":"2016-05-19T07:37:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I force pushed an update that explicitly sets the `compression.type` to `producer` so that the target codec always just adopts the source codec.\n\nThis seems better than removing the property altogether since that would make the target codec whatever the `compression.type` is at the time, which may not be `producer`.

For SSL we want to supply a principalBuilder using the property \"principal.builder.class\". \n1) Now consider we have a broker running on these 2 ports and supply that custom principalBuilder class using that config. \n2) The interbroker communication is using PlainText. I am using a single broker cluster for testing.\n3) Now we issue a produce request on the SSL port of the broker. \n4) The controller tries to build a channel for plaintext with this broker for the new topic instructions.\n5) PlainText tries to use the principal builder specified in the \"principal.builder.class\" config which was meant only for SSL port since the code path is same \"ChannelBuilders.createPrincipalBuilder(configs)\". \n6) In the custom principal Builder if we are trying to do some cert checks or down conversion of transportLayer to SSLTransportLayer so that we can use its functionality we get runtime exception.\n\nThe basic idea is the PlainText channel should not be using the PrincipalBuilder meant for other types of channels. We should probably have separate builders and authorizers for each type of channel if there is a valid use case here. For my usecase having a DefaultPrincipalBuilder for PlainText would suffice. But now that I think more, having a clear separation for those configs might be a good idea as a broker can run on multiple types of ports in future. \nI would be happy to start this discussion in Opensource email list and implement the patch if you guys agree.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/220411356/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/220422316","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1403#issuecomment-220422316","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1403","id":220422316,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMDQyMjMxNg==","user":{"login":"rajinisivaram","id":13164074,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTY0MDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13164074?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram","html_url":"https://github.com/rajinisivaram","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-19T19:06:43Z","updated_at":"2016-05-19T19:06:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@MayureshGharat Isn't the code in your custom principal builder in the method `buildPrincipal(TransportLayer transportLayer, Authenticator authenticator)`?

If not, throw `KafkaException`.\n- Whether a connection is ready to send requests is determined as below.\n  - If client does not want to check api versions, i.e, client has not specified required api versions, the connection must be in `CONNECTED` state.\n  - If client wants to check api versions, i.e., client has specified required api versions, the connection must be in `READY` state.\n\nValid connection states transitions.\n- Client does not want to perform api versions check. Note that this is what it is right now.\n  `DISCONNECTED` ->  `CONNECTING` -> `CONNECTED`\n- Client wants to perform api versions check. Added with this patch.\n  `DISCONNECTED` ->  `CONNECTING` -> `CONNECTED` -> `CHECKING_API_VERSIONS` -> `READY`\n\n> Mind explaining why you chose to plug in the validation where you did? \n> Both why do you think a new state is needed and why do you think handleConnection() (which until now just did some metrics) is the correct place for the validation?\n\nA new state is needed as a connection can be ready to send requests on either in `CONNECTED` or in `READY` state, based on client's need to check api versions.\n\nAs the api versions check is done for each connection, it is best to do it when we have a connection established. If check passes transition it to `READY` state that indicates successful api versions check. If the check fails, the connection is closed and an `KafkaException` is thrown.\n\n> It looks like you are validation every response. But - brokers can't respond in anything other than the request version, which the client provides.\n> I thought we discussed only validating the broker APIs when connecting. What made you change your mind?\n\nI don't think every response is getting validated, only `ApiVersion` response will be validated. `ApiVersion` request is only sent while connecting.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/220498557/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/220498990","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1409#issuecomment-220498990","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1409","id":220498990,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMDQ5ODk5MA==","user":{"login":"bharatviswa504","id":8586345,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1ODYzNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8586345?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharatviswa504","html_url":"https://github.com/bharatviswa504","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharatviswa504/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharatviswa504/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharatviswa504/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharatviswa504/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharatviswa504/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharatviswa504/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharatviswa504/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharatviswa504/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharatviswa504/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-20T01:58:59Z","updated_at":"2016-05-20T01:58:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@ijuma  This will be helpful when running with kerberos.

One general comment:\n\nIn `KafkaConsumer` we are restricting users to exclusively use either topics or pattern subscription. But in `KafkaStreams` it makes less sense to require them doing so. What would be better is that, for example:\n\n```\nstream1 = builder.stream(..., \"topic1\");\nstream2 = builder.stream(..., pattern2);\nstream3 = builder.stream(..., pattern3);\n```\n\nThen the streams library should be able to subscribe to `topic1 | [pattern2] | [pattern3]` (it may not be the correct syntax, but just the idea) as a single pattern subscription in the underlying consumer, and also remember a finer mapping from topic | pattern to the de-/serializers used upon fetching data and putting them to the buffer.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/220736049/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/220791296","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1410#issuecomment-220791296","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1410","id":220791296,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMDc5MTI5Ng==","user":{"login":"bbejeck","id":199238,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTIzOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/199238?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck","html_url":"https://github.com/bbejeck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-21T17:47:13Z","updated_at":"2016-05-21T17:47:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Then the streams library should be able to subscribe to topic1 | [pattern2] | [pattern3]....\n\n@guozhangwang. \n  Agreed, changes are underway.
