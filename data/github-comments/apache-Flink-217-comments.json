The Avro class structure changed, breaking the Pojo compatibility.\r\n\r\nAvro is binary format compatible, but not class compatible across versions, it seems. Makes sense, for a serialization format.\r\n\r\nNow, this brings up a few issues:\r\n  - Users that use generated Avro types from earlier Avro versions would be forced to upgrade (re-create) these classes with the new Avro version, if they upgrade Flink and it pulls in a newer Avro version. We might solve that by removing avro from `flink-dist` and pushing it into \"user code space\", where users can dependency manage the Avro version they want and need.\r\n\r\n  - In light of that, actually retaining Avro/Pojo backwards compatibility seems super complicated. I would almost suggest to not do that, because it seems it will not be transparent for users anyways (with Avro itself breaking compatibility).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/342025556/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/342065076","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4734#issuecomment-342065076","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4734","id":342065076,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MjA2NTA3Ng==","user":{"login":"tzulitai","id":5284370,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODQzNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5284370?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai","html_url":"https://github.com/tzulitai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-06T07:17:02Z","updated_at":"2017-11-06T07:17:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yes, I'll rebase this now.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/342065076/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/342090105","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4471#issuecomment-342090105","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4471","id":342090105,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MjA5MDEwNQ==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-06T09:20:33Z","updated_at":"2017-11-06T09:20:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the update @hequn8128! \r\nI'll be quite busy with testing and bug fixing for the upcoming 1.4 release in the next 2-3 weeks.

Avro is always part of the user code space, and hence will be loaded into the user code classloader. This solves multiple problems:\r\n     - It allows users to use a different Avro version compared to the version in a spoiled classpath (for example when Hadoop depenencies pull in another Avro version).\r\n     - It means that Avro class and schema caching is done per user code classloader, not JVM wide. That prevents \"X cannot be cast to X\" exceptions.\r\n\r\n  2. By default, a new pure Avro serializer is used for Avro types (in flight and in state). Since Avro class format changed, having compatibility activated by default is not possible anyways.\r\n\r\n  3. If a user wants to recover an old savepoint that happend to have Avro types serialized as PoJos, they need to do the following;\r\n     - Set the Avro version to the same version that they had when creating the savepoint. Since Avro now lives in user code space, that is possible without changing/rebuilding Flink.\r\n     - Pass a Flag to the `AvroTypeInfo` to use a backwards compatible Serializer: `new AvroTypeInfo(myType, true)`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/342156083/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/342162099","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4954#issuecomment-342162099","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4954","id":342162099,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MjE2MjA5OQ==","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-06T14:20:24Z","updated_at":"2017-11-06T14:20:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"merging.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/342162099/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/342166541","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4955#issuecomment-342166541","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4955","id":342166541,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MjE2NjU0MQ==","user":{"login":"pnowojski","id":8957547,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NTc1NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8957547?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski","html_url":"https://github.com/pnowojski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-06T14:35:17Z","updated_at":"2017-11-06T14:35:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@GJL

However, the resource are various and closely related to the platform(YARN/MESOS), only a GPUResource and FPGAResource may not satisfy user's need. For example, we have at lease two types of FPGA resources in our cluster. And it could consider the users who need to specify extended resources as advanced users. General users only need to know vcore and memory, which are already defined in ResurceSpec. Advanced users should be familiar with not only flink but also the resource platform. They should know the resources types YARN/MESOS supports. And, If flink resource manager passes all the extended resource to YARN/MESOS when starting a container, it need not change when adding a new resource type only if YARN/MESOS can recognize it from extended resources. There has to be a compromise between extendibility and ease of use. I suggest we can add a general GPUResource and FPGAResource for general use while still keeping the Resource for extension.

I think the YARN/MESOS resource manager should handle it in their own way. For example, in YarnResourceManager, it can add all extended resources to the yarn Resource.class by call setResourceValue(name, value). And then only if YARN support a new resource type, user can define it without code changing in flink.

think what you are referring to is the current trunk branch of Hadoop where they introduce `ResourceInformation`. Currently, the set of supported resources is  `\"memory-mb\", \"vcores\", \"yarn.io/gpu\"`. Given that you have to exactly set these names for the resource which are exclusive for `YARN`, I would actually say that we should explicitly add these resources (e.g. introducing a proper `GPUResource`). That way, this would also work if you let your job run on Mesos without having to adapt the resource names. Adding more resources should be fairly easy and therefore we don't need the generic resource.
