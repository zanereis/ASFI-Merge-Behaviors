@arina-ielchiieva - the change is almost complete, which also include change in querySubmitter, also I have found one bug in the querySubmitter - which is in side the file - [contrib\\native\\client\\example\\querySubmitter.cpp](https://github.com/apache/drill/blob/master/contrib/native/client/example/querySubmitter.cpp), earlier the value of variable **nOptions** was 25 which was not correct because the number of qsOptions was 26, and after my change this value is converted to 27.\r\n\r\nOther than that the only thing which is left is writing the unit test, which I have written but seeing some error while compiling the code, so currently I am working on resolving that

(Because vectors are write-once, we have to add (key, value) pairs one by one. If so, then we need a new form of writer, a `DictWriter` that has semantics such as:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  ObjectWriter key();\r\n  ObjectWriter value();\r\n  void save();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `key()` gives us an object writer that lets us access the key writer. If we restrict keys to be scalars, then we can just do:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  ScalarWriter key();\r\n```\r\n\r\nValues can, I imagine, be of any type. So, the `ObjectWriter` lets us work with them generically. Suppose we had a `DICT<VARCHAR,DOUBLE>`, we could do:\r\n\r\n```\r\n   DictWriter dictWriter = rowWriter.dict(\"myDict\");\r\n   dictWriter.key().setString(\"fred\");\r\n   dictWriter.value().scalar().setDouble(123.45)\r\n   dictWriter.save();\r\n   dictWriter.key().setString(\"barney\");\r\n   dictWriter.value().scalar().setDouble(98.76)\r\n   dictWriter.save();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis means that, in the `ObjectWriter()`, we need to add a new method, `dict()`, which will return a `DictWriter`, and we need to define the `DictWriter` interface.\r\n\r\nThere is quite a bit of commentary in the column accessor package that (tries) to explain the structure behind these writers. Perhaps that might help explain the ideas here.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/541440586/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/541442192","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1870#issuecomment-541442192","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1870","id":541442192,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0MTQ0MjE5Mg==","user":{"login":"paul-rogers","id":3248881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDg4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3248881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers","html_url":"https://github.com/paul-rogers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-13T18:07:49Z","updated_at":"2019-10-13T18:07:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"On, read, we can access the `DICT` as a dictionary and as an array. This means we need to be a bit clever about designing the `DictReader()` interface.\r\n\r\nWe can get our `DictReader` similar to the write case:\r\n\r\n```\r\n   DictReader dictReader = rowReader.dict(\"myDict\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, we have two ways to proceed. Either we want key/value lookups, or array access.\r\n\r\nFor array access, we want an iterator, much like the `ArrayReader`, but that gives us access to both the key and value. Something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\ninterface DictReader ...\r\n   ScalarReader key();\r\n   ObjectReader value();\r\n   boolean next();\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor key/value, we have a challenge. We need a way to specify the key that is type-specific. Then, we need to access the key in a type-specific way. This is the first time we've had such an issue.\r\n\r\nMaybe we can build this on the array iterator. In addition to the `next()` method, we can provide a `findFoo()` method, with one for each supported key type.\r\n\r\n```\r\n   int findString(String key);\r\n   int findInt(int key);\r\n   ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe semantics might be that the array index is set to the (first) index of the requested value, and that index is returned.\r\n\r\nIf not found, the return value is -1 and the array index is one past the end of the array.\r\n\r\n```\r\n   DictReader dictReader = ...\r\n   if (dictReader.findString(\"barney\")) {\r\n     value = dictReader.value().scalar().getDouble();\r\n   }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are probably other variations. Think how you expect to use the reader (for testing, yes, but what other operations)?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/541442192/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/541451748","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1871#issuecomment-541451748","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1871","id":541451748,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0MTQ1MTc0OA==","user":{"login":"paul-rogers","id":3248881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDg4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3248881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers","html_url":"https://github.com/paul-rogers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-13T19:46:00Z","updated_at":"2019-10-13T19:46:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@arina-ielchiieva, please review.

I'm seeing this need in multiple of recent plugins. I wonder, however, if we should offer a more scalable solution?\r\n\r\nWe currently have plugin, session, config and table function options all which control some aspect of reading and writing. The plugin and config options really want to be \"bulk\" or \"slow moving\" settings: set them once for a system or file format.\r\n\r\nSession options have two problems. First, they introduce client state: they must be set and reset around each query that needs them. This prevents load balancing and fail-over. (By contrast, Impala keeps options in the client and sends them to the server on each query, allowing unlimited load balancing via round-robin and allows transparent fail over.)\r\n\r\nFurther, session options are awkward for many tools: in addition to running a query, the client must send `ALTER SESSION` statements which are somehow associated with that query. Easy for our unit tests, not so easy for most BI tools.\r\n\r\nTable options look like what we want, but they have a number of issues, including that, when used, they \"erase\" any options set in the format plugin.\r\n\r\nThen, consider usability. Suppose I set the options and write a text file. What do I have to do to query that file I just wrote? Configure a specialized format plugin? Use table options? Seems we really need a more stable, mature solution; we're past the time where we can get away with workarounds.\r\n\r\nIs there some other solution we could consider? Better table options?

Now when user indicates write format using session option (this is common approach for all formats), Drill produces text files, it can read back. Basically, if user has configured format plugin:\r\n```\r\n  \"formats\": {\r\n    \"csvh\": {\r\n      \"type\": \"text\",\r\n      \"extensions\": [\r\n        \"csvh\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"lineDelimiter\": \"\\n\",\r\n      \"fieldDelimiter\": \",\",\r\n      \"extractHeader\": true\r\n    }\r\n   },\r\n```\r\nDrill will be able to read and write such text files correctly. Same approach is used for `parquet`, `json`. All user needs to do is to indicate write format using session option: `alter session set `store.format` = 'csvh';` (`parquet`, `json`). I am not saying this is ideal and we might need to reconsider such writing approach but I guess not in the scope of Jira since such re-design would touch all file writers.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/544469217/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/544475117","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1876#issuecomment-544475117","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1876","id":544475117,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NDQ3NTExNw==","user":{"login":"arina-ielchiieva","id":15086720,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDg2NzIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15086720?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva","html_url":"https://github.com/arina-ielchiieva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-21T11:37:36Z","updated_at":"2019-10-21T11:37:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"+1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/544475117/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/544475715","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1871#issuecomment-544475715","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1871","id":544475715,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NDQ3NTcxNQ==","user":{"login":"arina-ielchiieva","id":15086720,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDg2NzIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15086720?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva","html_url":"https://github.com/arina-ielchiieva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-21T11:39:47Z","updated_at":"2019-10-21T11:39:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@paul-rogers sorry could not merge this commit, since there a couple of minor comments.
