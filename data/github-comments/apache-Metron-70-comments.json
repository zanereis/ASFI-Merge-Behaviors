There is no configuration, starting, stopping or any other integration with the Mpack.\r\n\r\nI thought it wasn't worth it to add the configuration to Ambari. The Batch Profiler isn't a service that needs to remain running like the others, you wouldn't stop, start, or check the status of it.  \r\n\r\nYou have to run it from the command line.  If I add just the configuration elements to Ambari, then a user has to go into Ambari to change the configuration, use the command line to define their profile, and then run it from the command line.  Based on this, I feel adding it to Ambari makes it more difficult to use.\r\n\r\nNow eventually, I'd like to get a proper UI around the Profilers and I think at that point, we would be able to determine how it should integrate with the Mpack and that UI.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/422801240/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/422801585","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1191#issuecomment-422801585","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1191","id":422801585,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMjgwMTU4NQ==","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-19T13:23:35Z","updated_at":"2018-09-19T13:23:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"That being said, I will own opening a proper discuss thread on the mailing list to see if there are other features (like Mpack integration) that I should take care of before merging this feature branch into master.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/422801585/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/422802420","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1201#issuecomment-422802420","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1201","id":422802420,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMjgwMjQyMA==","user":{"login":"MohanDV","id":12934693,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTM0Njkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12934693?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MohanDV","html_url":"https://github.com/MohanDV","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MohanDV/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MohanDV/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MohanDV/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MohanDV/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MohanDV/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MohanDV/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MohanDV/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MohanDV/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MohanDV/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-19T13:25:52Z","updated_at":"2018-09-19T13:25:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@nickwallen It's my bad I dint run this up in Full Dev, I verified my scripts on a 12 node cluster.

We can add complexity (like multiple threads, caching) on top of a simple, synchronous approach should it be needed.

Its one or the other.\r\n\r\nIMHO, Callbacks just seems overly complex and less obvious to me.  I could see the value of using callbacks if this was asynchronous, but its not.  The callbacks are made synchronously and so just returning a List seems like the most obvious approach.\r\n\r\nIf callbacks more closely aligns with what was there, then just go with that.  Better done sooner than delaying over a small nit like this.  I will assent to either.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/426388670/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/426412891","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1213#issuecomment-426412891","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1213","id":426412891,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNjQxMjg5MQ==","user":{"login":"merrimanr","id":311928,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTkyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/311928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr","html_url":"https://github.com/merrimanr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-02T20:10:46Z","updated_at":"2018-10-02T20:10:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The MessageParser.parseOptional call returns a list of JSONObjects which is then processed (field transformations applied, messages validated, etc).  The difference is WHEN each processed JSONObject is written to Kafka.  In the current ParserBolt each one is sent as soon as it is processed because everything runs in ParserBolt.execute.  Since we are extracting that logic outside of the ParserBolt, we either need to write them all after processing is done by the abstraction or expose callbacks that the abstraction calls as it finishes processing each one.\r\n\r\nI don't think it matters much either way.  I chose to use callbacks because it more closely matches the flow of the current ParserBolt.  I will assume everyone is ok with callbacks and will continue work on the suggestions made in the comments.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/426412891/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/426422547","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1217#issuecomment-426422547","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1217","id":426422547,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNjQyMjU0Nw==","user":{"login":"mmiklavc","id":658443,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODQ0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/658443?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc","html_url":"https://github.com/mmiklavc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-02T20:42:06Z","updated_at":"2018-10-02T20:42:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@sardell Thanks for the contribution and write-up!
