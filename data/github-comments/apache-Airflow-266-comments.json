Only the newly initiated installations would not have any `id` column, which isn't used anywhere 👍 However technically, I know, you should not touch existing migrations.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/546676541/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/546676630","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6439#issuecomment-546676630","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6439","id":546676630,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NjY3NjYzMA==","user":{"login":"BasPH","id":6249654,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNDk2NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6249654?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH","html_url":"https://github.com/BasPH","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-27T09:24:42Z","updated_at":"2019-10-27T09:24:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I can make PRs per service, will start at A of Athena.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/546676630/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/546676751","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6443#issuecomment-546676751","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6443","id":546676751,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NjY3Njc1MQ==","user":{"login":"mingrammer","id":6178510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxNzg1MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6178510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingrammer","html_url":"https://github.com/mingrammer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingrammer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingrammer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingrammer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingrammer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingrammer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingrammer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingrammer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingrammer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingrammer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-27T09:26:36Z","updated_at":"2019-10-27T09:26:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ok.

Instead of converting it to a string, and parse it again.\r\n\r\nI don't think your example is complete. What would be the value of the `execution_date` for each of the runs? There are two options:\r\n- They are the same. So on the first run, the `old_xcom` will be None, because it never ran before, and it will raise the error. On the second run, they will be equal, so the exception will not be raise. Same for the third run.\r\n- They are monotonically increasing. For example, a daily run. Then the first run will still error, and the second run will error as well since the first xcom will be smaller than the second.\r\n\r\nBolke triggered me, in combination with your comment about the use of `include_prior_dates`.  When you set this option to `True`, which is `False` by default, then the `xcom_pull` won't be idempotent anymore for the same taskinstance. Which it definitly should. So I'm thinking of making this configurable. By adding an option to the `xcom_pull`, for example, `include_self` (working name), which implies that it will also include earlier xcom's of itself.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/546707884/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/546708109","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6442#issuecomment-546708109","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6442","id":546708109,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NjcwODEwOQ==","user":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-27T16:00:09Z","updated_at":"2019-10-27T16:00:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Dutch idiom: I don't want to mow the grass in front of @dstandish 's feet.

As I can read: \r\n\r\n> In case of transfer operators where two providers are involved, the transfer operators will be moved to \"source\" of the transfer. \r\n\r\nMeaning in this case AWS indeed.\r\n3 remarks from my point of view:\r\n\r\n1. I was picking up the Jira ticket only, so if those are pretty flexible and we can change the scope mid-way no worries for me\r\n2. I was not planning to tackle all aspects of AIP-21 in that PR (again just focussing on the Jira ticket): for example you could treat this operator for both `case 1` and `case 2`, but I was leaving `case 2` out of the scope of this PR. If it makes more sense to tackle both at the same time, let me know,\r\n3. In the case of s3 to gcs there are 2 operators doing the job `s3_to_gcs_operator` and `s3_to_gcs_transfer_operator`. According to the quote above, they should both end up in `providers/aws` but in the case of `s3_to_gcs_transfer_operator`, it actually uses a gcp service under the hood and arguably could end up in `providers/google/gcp` 😅  .

If we think in the future about splitting different providers to separate packages, and getting some kind of \"stewardship\" over the operator groups, it makes much more sense that the s3_to_gcs is under the \"stewardship\" of people who take care about the \"providers/google\" package rather than those of \"providers/amazon\". \r\n\r\nKnowing how it works, I guess people who take care about

Not sure.\r\n\r\nYeah I thought about this too and was also unsure.  Just \"connection\" is a term that has great potential for conflict / confusion / ambiguity, to add it to all hooks could be trouble.  Maybe if we renamed `Connection` to `AirflowConnection`...  Or perhaps better, `Creds` or `Credential`.  `Connection` is not really a connection.  Come to think of it, this causes a lot of confusing code (all the `get_conn` in the codebase).  \r\n\r\nAn alternative approach would be to alter the hook to accept every param the mysql connections (actual connection) would need, so that the GCP Cloud SQL hook does not actually need to create a connection object -- it can just pass the appropriate params to postgres / mysql hook.  \r\n\r\nOn this latter idea, some have discouraged adding params like `password` as init params for hook on the basis it would allow users to do bad things like put creds in the dag file under source control.  I personally don't feel like we should be nanny state in that way.   Constrain as we might, a novice user might still put `pyodbc.connect` in their dags, for example.  So I don't see this as a reason not to add params.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/546762456/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/546765878","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6440#issuecomment-546765878","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6440","id":546765878,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0Njc2NTg3OA==","user":{"login":"dstandish","id":15932138,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTMyMTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15932138?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish","html_url":"https://github.com/dstandish","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-28T02:19:51Z","updated_at":"2019-10-28T02:21:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"OK Just want to offer one more idea.\r\n\r\nIf we don't like adding `connection` to mysql hook / postgres hook, we can make simple subclasses in `airflow/gcp/hooks/cloud_sql.py`.

Yeah I think it's good for hooks to have this.  I'd like it if every hook had a static method that took all valid params and produce correct URI.  With a `conn.get_uri()` method, this would be more convenient -- hook get_uri methods could just create the conn object and call get_uri.\r\n\r\nE.g. for GCP, such a method could look like this:\r\n```\r\n    @staticmethod\r\n    def get_uri(\r\n        project=None,\r\n        key_path=None,\r\n        keyfile_dict=None,\r\n        scope=None,\r\n        num_retries=None,\r\n    ):\r\n        extra_dict = dict(\r\n            project=project,\r\n            key_path=key_path,\r\n            keyfile_dict=keyfile_dict,\r\n            scope=scope,\r\n            num_retries=num_retries,\r\n        )\r\n        extra = json.dumps(\r\n            {\"extra__google_cloud_platform__\" + k: v for k, v in extra_dict.items() if v is not None}\r\n        )\r\n        conn = Connection(conn_type='google-cloud-platform', extra=extra)\r\n        return conn.get_uri()\r\n```\r\n\r\nStepping back, do you think this PR is a worthwhile addition (i.e. adding `get_uri` to `Connection`)?  \r\n\r\nIt's a small thing, but I think it's good to have a standardized method of generating a uri that is guaranteed to parse correctly.\r\n\r\nSo a user could build their connection object with init params, and then generate a URI that will work.  No fussing with urllib.  No digging through to see how things are parsed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/546806770/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/546829021","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5388#issuecomment-546829021","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5388","id":546829021,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NjgyOTAyMQ==","user":{"login":"dstandish","id":15932138,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTMyMTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15932138?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish","html_url":"https://github.com/dstandish","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-28T07:46:19Z","updated_at":"2019-10-28T07:46:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> @dstandish tests did not run because of Falke8 error:\r\n> `tests/models/test_taskinstance.py:1285:1: W293 blank line contains whitespace`\r\n> \r\n> can you resolve this?\r\n\r\n@OmerJog  rebased. passed flake8 locally.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/546829021/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/546840181","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6442#issuecomment-546840181","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6442","id":546840181,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0Njg0MDE4MQ==","user":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-28T08:23:18Z","updated_at":"2019-10-28T08:23:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Yeah.
