Do we really need separate classes for specifying the `EndPoint` ? can we just make them internal to `SeciurityConfHandler` ?\r\n\r\nThe API classes can be internal if there's consensus for that, but my personal vote would be that they stay separate.\r\n\r\n1. The current mapping of APIs -> RequestHandlers is based entirely on the v1 API without any consideration of v2.  There's no reason in a v2 world for the `GET /cluster/aliases` API to live in CollectionsHandler.java.\r\n2. Many of our RequestHandler's are absolute monsters.  The more code we can keep out of those files, the better IMO.

I think we should probably keep the helper methods instead of sub-classing ConcurrentHashMap. But that's a separate issue than what you are trying to fix really.\r\n\r\nYes we can discuss about that, I don't have any strong opinion here.\r\n\r\nMy design of putting it into a separate class is based on the reasoning that updating the doc collection is tightly tied with the state of the of the watcher, especially that the `collectionsWatched` contains the DocCollection state now 😄 . Therefore I feel that might be reasonable encapsulation. \r\n\r\nWith the helper approach, it might be slightly harder to figure out the helper modifies the field by inspecting the method signature alone. It's more of a personal preference that I found methods with side effect a bit hard to track sometimes 😅 (even my current approach it still modifies the state ie has side effects too! But I think it's more obvious that the call/change is applied to the `collectionsWatched` object 😊 )\r\n\r\nThank you for the helpful code review!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1162477379/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1163147648","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/912#issuecomment-1163147648","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/912","id":1163147648,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5FVDmA","user":{"login":"risdenk","id":3384157,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzODQxNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3384157?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk","html_url":"https://github.com/risdenk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-22T14:07:46Z","updated_at":"2022-06-22T14:07:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @madrob for the quick review.

There are 3 variations:\r\n1. `collectionWatches` does not have key for such collection - That means the collection is not being watched\r\n2. `collectionWatches.get(\"test-collection\")` returns null, this should not happen, as all the entries insert into the map is non null\r\n3. `collectionWatches.get(\"test-collection\")` does returns a `DocCollectionWatch` but has field `currentDoc` as `null`, that means the collection is actively watched, however either the `refreshAndWatch` is not called yet, or last fetched state indicates that the collection is not yet existed or deleted from ZK.\r\n\r\n\r\n> \r\n> Also can we rename `currentDoc` to `currentState`?

Thanks for the comment!\r\n\r\n> It's a bit subjective of course but the solr.xml needing to be changed, that seems a bit of a burden, both operationally and in terms of code complexity? I wonder if there might be some way to dynamically discover actions e.g. if the action was a fully qualified class path and CoreAdminHandler had access to SolrResourceLoader then could SolrResourceLoader.newInstance instantiate the action on demand?\r\n\r\nYeah, that would be nice to not bother with `solr.xml`, but at the moment I doesn't see nice workaround.\r\n\r\nPluggable nature usually implies classes should be defined somewhere (`*.xml`, `manifest.mf`, etc). On system start, plugins files are examined for plugin extention points, and some global registry is populated with the relevant entries (let's not take into account some plugin frameworks that can do runtime loading/unloading , like OSGi). So we can say we applied exactly the same idea above. Solr can be assumed as \"pluggable\" to some extent, as custom things can be redefined in configuration (`solr.xml` or `solrconfig.xml`), but Solr still is not fully qualified pluggable (no plugin extension points, no separation/isolation of classloaders).\r\n\r\nThe other way to do discovery, is dynamic class descovery by scanning the classpath. From one side it looks very powerfull, you can use annotations for marking classes, etc. But at the same time it is quite heavy and implies unnecassary class loading.\r\n\r\nI am still examing different parts of Solr, so maybe I have missed something, and there are already some examples of dynamic discovery of classes. If you know of some examples, give me a note please.\r\n\r\n> From a use point of view the action being a class path seems not very nice though. We could make up some convention where the pluggable class always starts with (say) CustomCoreAdminOp and where the action follows after that (say) CustomCoreAdminOpFoo but I don't know if going from foo action to CustomCoreAdminOpFoo class name would be enough to actually instantiate an object. Plus there could be two classes with the same name in different name spaces. Hmm.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to go the way you suggested, we can make an interface implying the action name definition:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic interface CustomCoreAdminOp extends CoreAdminOp {\r\n\r\n\tpublic String getName();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand even provide some way to override/alias the action name. But I am agree, pushing the full qualified class name is looks too much.\r\n\r\nAnother idea is, first users need to execute some register action request, i.e. \r\n\r\n```\r\nhttp://localhost:8983/solr/admin/cores?action=registeraction&class=com.ijioio.solr.action.FooAction&name=foo\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut it implies always running this register action on all the shards, at least for cases when your action is a part of collection related logic :( Feels quite tricky and not transparent.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1181375536/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1182453009","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/938#issuecomment-1182453009","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/938","id":1182453009,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5Ges0R","user":{"login":"dsmiley","id":377295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzI5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/377295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley","html_url":"https://github.com/dsmiley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-12T20:09:29Z","updated_at":"2022-07-12T20:09:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for giving this a shot @epugh!\r\n\r\nI now remember what I found when Googling how to get Spotless to do this some months ago.
