Therefore, I clone the resultset into a cachedrowset to be able to change the cursor position back and forth. This works for PostgreSQL, but fails for MySql. The error I get is:\r\n\r\n_java.sql.SQLException: Streaming result set com.mysql.jdbc.RowDataDynamic@6c7bd190 is still active. No statements may be issued when any streaming result sets are open and in use on a given connection. Ensure that you have called .close() on any active streaming result sets before attempting more queries.\r\nat com.mysql.jdbc.SQLError.createSQLException(SQLError.java:869)\r\nat com.mysql.jdbc.SQLError.createSQLException(SQLError.java:865)\r\nat com.mysql.jdbc.MysqlIO.checkForOutstandingStreamingData(MysqlIO.java:3217)\r\nat com.mysql.jdbc.MysqlIO.sendCommand(MysqlIO.java:2453)\r\nat com.mysql.jdbc.MysqlIO.sqlQueryDirect(MysqlIO.java:2683)\r\nat com.mysql.jdbc.ConnectionImpl.execSQL(ConnectionImpl.java:2495)\r\nat com.mysql.jdbc.PreparedStatement.executeInternal(PreparedStatement.java:1903)\r\nat com.mysql.jdbc.PreparedStatement.execute(PreparedStatement.java:1242)\r\nat com.mysql.jdbc.StatementImpl.createResultSetUsingServerFetch(StatementImpl.java:663)\r\nat com.mysql.jdbc.StatementImpl.executeQuery(StatementImpl.java:1343)\r\nat com.mysql.jdbc.Field.getCollation(Field.java:446)\r\nat com.mysql.jdbc.ResultSetMetaData.isCaseSensitive(ResultSetMetaData.java:552)\r\nat com.sun.rowset.CachedRowSetImpl.initMetaData(Unknown Source)\r\nat com.sun.rowset.CachedRowSetImpl.populate(Unknown Source)_\r\n\r\n\r\nI call: _cachedRowSet.populate(rs);_ and this is where it fails. I traced the code of _populate()_ and found that the populate method calls another statement on the connection to get more info about the resultset (see https://github.com/spullara/mysql-connector-java/blob/cc5922f6712c491d0cc46e846ae0dc674c9a5844/src/main/java/com/mysql/jdbc/Field.java#L481 ). And because in MySQL streaming mode we cannot run another statement on the active connection, it throws the above error.\r\n\r\nI also investigated further in Sharding-Proxy's code to see if the resultset is created for streaming, and the answer was Yes! According to the MySQL documentation: \"The combination of a forward-only, read-only result set, with a fetch size of Integer.MIN_VALUE serves as a signal to the driver to stream result sets row-by-row\". And this is what is set in the Sharding-Proxy.\r\n\r\nTo resolve, I changed the MYSQL_MEMORY_FETCH_ONE_ROW_A_TIME attribute in the ProxyJDBCExecutePrepareCallback class from Integer.MIN_VALUE to 1 to disable the stream mode resultset (or in fact change connection mode from Memory_Stricktly to Connection_Stricktly ), and rebuilt the project. Now, the previous error is gone, and it works better. However, when in the mysql command line, I use \"USE mydatabase;\" to switch between databases, it throws the following error:\r\n\r\n_com.mysql.jdbc.exceptions.jdbc4.MySQLSyntaxErrorException: Unknown table 'TABLE_NAMES' in information_schema\r\n\tat sun.reflect.NativeConstructorAccessorImpl.newInstance0(Native Method)\r\n\tat sun.reflect.NativeConstructorAccessorImpl.newInstance(Unknown Source)\r\n\tat sun.reflect.DelegatingConstructorAccessorImpl.newInstance(Unknown Source)\r\n\tat java.lang.reflect.Constructor.newInstance(Unknown Source)\r\n\tat com.mysql.jdbc.Util.handleNewInstance(Util.java:425)\r\n\tat com.mysql.jdbc.Util.getInstance(Util.java:408)\r\n\tat com.mysql.jdbc.SQLError.createSQLException(SQLError.java:944)\r\n\tat com.mysql.jdbc.MysqlIO.checkErrorPacket(MysqlIO.java:3978)\r\n\tat com.mysql.jdbc.MysqlIO.checkErrorPacket(MysqlIO.java:3914)\r\n\tat com.mysql.jdbc.MysqlIO.sendCommand(MysqlIO.java:2530)\r\n\tat com.mysql.jdbc.MysqlIO.sqlQueryDirect(MysqlIO.java:2683)\r\n\tat com.mysql.jdbc.ConnectionImpl.execSQL(ConnectionImpl.java:2495)\r\n\tat com.mysql.jdbc.PreparedStatement.executeInternal(PreparedStatement.java:1903)\r\n\tat com.mysql.jdbc.PreparedStatement.execute(PreparedStatement.java:1242)\r\n\tat com.mysql.jdbc.StatementImpl.createResultSetUsingServerFetch(StatementImpl.java:663)\r\n\tat com.mysql.jdbc.StatementImpl.executeQuery(StatementImpl.java:1343)\r\n\tat com.mysql.jdbc.Field.getCollation(Field.java:446)\r\n\tat com.mysql.jdbc.ResultSetMetaData.isCaseSensitive(ResultSetMetaData.java:552)\r\n\tat com.sun.rowset.CachedRowSetImpl.initMetaData(Unknown Source)\r\n\tat com.sun.rowset.CachedRowSetImpl.populate(Unknown Source)\r\n\tat org.apache.shardingsphere.shardingproxy.backend.communication.jdbc.execute.callback.ProxySQLExecuteCallback.executeSQL(ProxySQLExecuteCallback.java:90)\r\n\tat org.apache.shardingsphere.shardingproxy.backend.communication.jdbc.execute.callback.ProxySQLExecuteCallback.executeSQL(ProxySQLExecuteCallback.java:77)\r\n\tat org.apache.shardingsphere.shardingproxy.backend.communication.jdbc.execute.callback.ProxySQLExecuteCallback.executeSQL(ProxySQLExecuteCallback.java:1)\r\n\tat org.apache.shardingsphere.sharding.execute.sql.execute.SQLExecuteCallback.execute0(SQLExecuteCallback.java:82)\r\n\tat org.apache.shardingsphere.sharding.execute.sql.execute.SQLExecuteCallback.execute(SQLExecuteCallback.java:58)\r\n\tat org.apache.shardingsphere.underlying.executor.engine.ExecutorEngine.syncExecute(ExecutorEngine.java:97)\r\n\tat org.apache.shardingsphere.underlying.executor.engine.ExecutorEngine.parallelExecute(ExecutorEngine.java:93)\r\n\tat org.apache.shardingsphere.underlying.executor.engine.ExecutorEngine.execute(ExecutorEngine.java:76)\r\n\tat org.apache.shardingsphere.sharding.execute.sql.execute.SQLExecuteTemplate.execute(SQLExecuteTemplate.java:68)\r\n\tat org.apache.shardingsphere.shardingproxy.backend.communication.jdbc.execute.JDBCExecuteEngine.execute(JDBCExecuteEngine.java:78)\r\n\tat org.apache.shardingsphere.shardingproxy.backend.communication.jdbc.JDBCDatabaseCommunicationEngine.execute(JDBCDatabaseCommunicationEngine.java:98)\r\n\tat org.apache.shardingsphere.shardingproxy.backend.communication.jdbc.JDBCDatabaseCommunicationEngine.execute(JDBCDatabaseCommunicationEngine.java:84)\r\n\tat org.apache.shardingsphere.shardingproxy.backend.text.admin.UnicastBackendHandler.execute(UnicastBackendHandler.java:55)\r\n\tat org.apache.shardingsphere.shardingproxy.frontend.mysql.command.query.text.query.MySQLComQueryPacketExecutor.execute(MySQLComQueryPacketExecutor.java:73)\r\n\tat org.apache.shardingsphere.shardingproxy.frontend.command.CommandExecutorTask.executeCommand(CommandExecutorTask.java:90)\r\n\tat org.apache.shardingsphere.shardingproxy.frontend.command.CommandExecutorTask.run(CommandExecutorTask.java:70)\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(Unknown Source)\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(Unknown Source)\r\n\tat java.lang.Thread.run(Unknown Source)_\r\n\r\n_[ERROR] 08:32:33.275 [pool-4-thread-1] o.a.s.s.f.c.CommandExecutorTask -

, thanks for re-edit, it's more clear now.\r\n\r\nI wonder what is the Exception and logs for \" I am not able to move forward and backward on the ResultSet\".\r\n\r\nActually, move forward and
