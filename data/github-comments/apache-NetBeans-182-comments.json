The author didn't know at that time how to build a universal library for arm64 and x86_64. The build produces a library with support for i386, ppc, ppc64 and x86_64. Because Apple drop the support for ppc and i386 we should not longer support them (no chance to update the code).\r\n\r\nAs a result we can focus on building a library for x86_64 and arm64. This is what I have done. I tested the library with NB19 with success (even if I am not totally clear why there is a jdk16 dependency...).\r\n\r\nNew build file is attached.

An idea is to test in safe mode. I do not know if NetBeans can be run under safe mode.

So it does not matter if it is an Intel or Apple Silicon based machine to compile for x86 and arm64, because the compiler is able to cross compile for both architectures. This explains why my change works.\r\n\r\nOne further bit I don't understand is the role of https://netbeans.osuosl.org/binaries/ , which may makes things more complicated than necessary. As far as I understand one have to download the profiler-external-binaries-ASF.zip from GitHub and manually upload it to https://netbeans.osuosl.org/binaries/ with recreation of checksums etc. Wouldn't it be much easier to upload the artefact to maven.apache.org (with proper versioning of course) and then consume it from the ant build with the ant get task?\r\n\r\nAnd yes I agree that a designated project for all native code could make the build more understandable and easier to maintain. At least this would be true for all artefacts which does not have a dependency to the java code (like open_pty etc). But again there should be an automatic way to upload the artefacts (preferable a maven repository).\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1737121174/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1737178349","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/6494#issuecomment-1737178349","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/6494","id":1737178349,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5nizzt","user":{"login":"neilcsmith-net","id":3975960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3975960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net","html_url":"https://github.com/neilcsmith-net","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-27T11:03:28Z","updated_at":"2023-09-27T11:03:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@sroeper I've opened a discussion on dev@ https://lists.apache.org/thread/08hsrfgn6klcf9bm8t96h6pv0zrysfjm\r\n\r\nOSUOSL was intended for third-party binaries consumed in the build, such as the original Oracle CDDL licensed versions of the profiler binaries.

These are compiled (see the contents of the zip file) for the following platforms and oses:\r\n\r\n- Linux (ARM 64, Sparc 64, x86, x86_64)\r\n- MacOSX (x86, x86_64)\r\n- SunOS (sparc, x86, x86_64)\r\n- Windows (x86, x86_64)\r\n\r\n2) The code for these binaries is actually APLv2, and is hosted in the [ide/dlight.nativeexecution/tools](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/tree/master/ide/dlight.nativeexecution/tools) subdirectory (wich in turn is a NetBeans CND project).\r\n\r\n3) This APLv2 source code was compiled ages ago (2012, 2015, 2017, 2022, if the dates in the zip file are correct) for those different platforms. Of course at the time of compilation there was not such a thing as \"Apple M1\" or \"Apple M2\" and their variants.\r\n\r\n4) NetBeans tries to read this \"external\" dependency at runtime from this binary dependency. For \"Apple M1\" and \"Apple M2\" boxes it cannot find the proper binary, and that's why this fails.\r\n\r\nTo solve the issue at once:\r\n\r\na) Compile the binary **once** in the required platform using the \"ide/dlight.nativeexecution/tools/buildall.sh\" script (I assume that if you build this in an Apple M1 box it will work well for Apple M2 boxes)\r\nb) Add the compiled binaries files to the directory `MacOSX-arm_64/` (that  @tmulle recommends, so NetBeans can find them) to the downloaded `external/exechlp-1.2.zip` file. Rename this to, say, `external/exechlp-1.3.zip`.\r\nc) Upload the binary file to OSUOSL with the updated SHA1 sum.\r\nd) Modify `external/binaries-list` to reflect the proper SHA1 sum.\r\ne) Wait for apple to release Apple M3, and goto a).\r\n\r\nTo solve the issue forever:\r\n\r\na) Ensure that Apple becomes an [sponsor of the Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org/foundation/sponsors). D'oh! Apple is a platinum sponsor!\r\nb) Ensure that Apple is a **very good sponsor** (it already is) and makes some Apple M1 boxes for us (ASF) to build stuff for their customers.\r\nc) Install a cross platform compiler (clang/gcc) in the Apple M1 donated by Apple.\r\nd) Create a build job that uses this Apple M1 computer to build binaries for Apple M1 boxes. If you've succeeded at d) ensure that the compiler cross compiles for other platforms/boxes.\r\ne) Integrate this build-bot in the NetBeans release cycle (github actions, etc.).\r\nf) Enjoy a NetBeans release bot that compiles binaries for all Apple architectures.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAntonio\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1741052884/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1741081811","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/3467#issuecomment-1741081811","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/3467","id":1741081811,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5nxszT","user":{"login":"neilcsmith-net","id":3975960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3975960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net","html_url":"https://github.com/neilcsmith-net","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-29T15:31:55Z","updated_at":"2023-09-29T15:31:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks @vieiro but I wasn't intending to use OSUOSL or user compiled binaries (which would both be -1 anyway).
