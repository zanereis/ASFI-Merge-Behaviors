For producers and consumers, the metric registry is internal and metrics are only exposed as an unmodifiable map. This allows users to access client metric values for use in application health checks, etc., but doesn't allow them to register new metrics.\n\nThat approach seems reasonable if we assume that a user interested in defining custom metrics is already going to be using a separate metrics library. In such a case, users will likely find it easier to define metrics using whatever library they're familiar with rather than learning the API for Kafka's `Metrics` class. Is this a reasonable assumption?\n\nIf we want to expose the `Metrics` instance so that users can define arbitrary metrics, I'd argue that there's need for documentation updates. In particular, I find the notion of metric tags confusing. Tags can be defined in a `MetricConfig` when the `Metrics` instance is constructed, `StreamsMetricsImpl` is maintaining its own set of tags, and users can set tag overrides.\n\nIf a user were to get access to the `Metrics` instance, they would be missing the tags defined in `StreamsMetricsImpl`. I'm imagining that users would want their custom metrics to sit alongside the predefined metrics with the same tags, and users shouldn't be expected to manage those additional tags themselves.\n\nSo, why are we allowing users to define their own metrics via the `StreamsMetrics` interface in the first place? Is it that we'd like to be able to provide a built-in latency metric, but the definition depends on the details of the use case so there's no generic solution? That would be sufficient motivation for this special case of `addLatencySensor`. If we want to continue down that path and give users access to define a wider range of custom metrics, I'd prefer to extend the `StreamsMetrics` interface so that users can call methods on that object, automatically getting the tags appropriate for that instance rather than interacting with the raw `Metrics` instance.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/219064302/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/219104002","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1382#issuecomment-219104002","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1382","id":219104002,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxOTEwNDAwMg==","user":{"login":"jklukas","id":691060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MTA2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/691060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jklukas","html_url":"https://github.com/jklukas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jklukas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jklukas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jklukas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jklukas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jklukas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jklukas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jklukas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jklukas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jklukas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-13T17:14:10Z","updated_at":"2016-05-13T17:14:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"cc

You can try again.\n\nAs for the discussion above, here are my two cents (would love to hear from other people as well @mjsax @enothereska @miguno @ijuma @junrao ):\n1. For the producer/consumer cases, all internal metrics are provided and abstracted from users, and they just need to read the documentation to poll whatever provided metrics that they are interested; and if they want to define more metrics, they are likely to be outside the clients themselves and they can use whatever methods they like, so `Metrics` do not need to be exposed to users.\n2. For streams, things are a bit different: users define the computational logic, which becomes part of the \"Streams Client\" processing and may be of interests to be monitored by user themselves; think of a customized processor that sends an email to some address based on a condition, and users want to monitor the average rate of emails sent. Hence it is worth considering whether or not they should be able to access the `Metrics` instance to define their own along side the pre-defined metrics provided by the library.\n3. Now, since the `Metrics` class was not previously designed for public usage, it is not designed to be very user-friendly for defining sensors, especially the semantics differences between name / scope / tags. `StreamsMetrics` tries to hide some of these semantics confusion from users, but it still expose tags and hence is not perfect in doing so. We need to think of a better approach so that: 1) user defined metrics will be \"aligned\" (i.e. with the same name prefix within a single application, with similar scope hierarchy definition, etc) with library provided metrics, 2) natural APIs to do so.\n\nI do not have concrete ideas about 3) above on top of my head, comments are more than welcomed.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/219122993/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/219123172","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1382#issuecomment-219123172","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1382","id":219123172,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxOTEyMzE3Mg==","user":{"login":"jklukas","id":691060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MTA2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/691060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jklukas","html_url":"https://github.com/jklukas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jklukas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jklukas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jklukas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jklukas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jklukas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jklukas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jklukas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jklukas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jklukas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-13T18:28:18Z","updated_at":"2016-05-13T18:28:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@guozhangwang - In my case, I added a serde that translates between JSON and a particular POJO type.

You can start a discussion thread on the KIP (as mentioned in the\nprocess wiki) whenever you are ready.\n\nFew things I'd like to see discussed in the KIP is:\n\n1) When applying this policy, replicas may stop being identical (if a\nreplica happened to be on a disk with a busier partition, it may have less\ndata than what should have been an identical copy). This can lead to weird\nscenarios following leader elections and consumers who try to read entire\npartitions. Reasonable limitation? Or something we should be concerned\nabout and try to address?\n\n2) How does this interact with log compaction?\n\n3) The JIRA you referred to mentions a new configuration \"disk.full.policy\" I\nthought it was an interesting idea. We can have options like \"discard\noldest\" (your pr, essentially), \"reject new data\", and \"do nothing\" (which\nessentially disables the feature). What do you think?\n\nGwen\n\nOn Fri, May 13, 2016 at 1:16 PM, bendrees notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Created KIP-61:\n> \n> https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-61%3A+Add+a+log+retention+parameter+for+maximum+disk+space+usage+percentage\n> \n> —\n> You are receiving this because you were mentioned.\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1348#issuecomment-219148230\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/219157979/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/219175016","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1382#issuecomment-219175016","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1382","id":219175016,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxOTE3NTAxNg==","user":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-13T22:31:52Z","updated_at":"2016-05-13T22:31:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"As for this specific case, I was not expecting users to extend `Serdes` before, but thinking about it a bit it may be a good choice.

The offset commit should come from the coordinator connection, so if you follow the template of the other tests, you should just need to add something like this:\n\n``` java\nStruct offsetCommitResponse = buildOffsetCommitResponse();\nclient.prepareResponseFrom(offsetCommitResponse, coordinator);\n```\n\nAnd you can look in `ConsumerCoordinatorTest` to figure out how to build the offset commit response. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/219485443/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/219499585","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1361#issuecomment-219499585","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1361","id":219499585,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxOTQ5OTU4NQ==","user":{"login":"coughman","id":944557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0NDU1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/944557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coughman","html_url":"https://github.com/coughman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coughman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coughman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coughman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coughman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coughman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coughman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coughman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coughman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coughman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-16T18:07:25Z","updated_at":"2016-05-16T18:07:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"sure I'll add those in\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/219499585/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/219511595","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1388#issuecomment-219511595","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1388","id":219511595,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxOTUxMTU5NQ==","user":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-16T18:49:20Z","updated_at":"2016-05-16T18:49:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The reason we put the `Record.write(...)` in `Record` is to not leak Record layout internals to `Compressor`.

Thanks again for your help. I looked at `ConsumerCoordinatorTest` and it seems to me that `OffsetCommitResponse` does not deal with actual offset value, but rather with committing the offset and making sure the commit is successful. Is it possible that `OffsetFetchResponse` is what's needed here? I actually tried `OffsetFetchResponse` in the unit test [here](https://github.com/vahidhashemian/kafka/blob/KAFKA-3664-ALT2/clients/src/test/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/consumer/KafkaConsumerTest.java#L476) without an error; but, even if the answer to my question above is \"yes\", I'm thinking I'm not doing everything right there. The reason is I am making up the offset fetch result, while I actually want to check what the offset value of `partition1` is as a result of running the unit test and changing `consumer1`'s subscription.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/219581313/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/219610894","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1393#issuecomment-219610894","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1393","id":219610894,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxOTYxMDg5NA==","user":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-17T03:31:42Z","updated_at":"2016-05-17T03:31:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Local
