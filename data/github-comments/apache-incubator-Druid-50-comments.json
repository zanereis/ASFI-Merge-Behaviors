think that it seems to be from duplicated exclusion of complement range end at flip() of MutableRoaringBitmap and not() of MappeableContainer.\n\nIf a range (rangeStart, rangeEnd) is given to flip(), it consider rangeStart as inclusive begining of range and rangeEnd as exclusive end of range, which means it only checks range from rangeStart to rangeEnd - 1.\nHowever, not() excludes the end of given range again, which means it only checks range from rangeStart to rangeEnd - 2.\nSo, last bit of the given roaring bitmap is excluded from complement operation.\n\nI think it shoud be fixed at

because of the memory pressure, so there will be 10 persist and 1 big merge.\n\nThe old way(create V8, then convert to V9):\ntotal persist time: 101.3s ( 10 persists)\ntotal merge time: 89.2s \n\nThe new way(create V9 directly):\ntotal persist time: 65.641113s\ntotal merge time: 53.852s\n\nThe performance gain is about: (101.3+89.2-65.6-53.8)/(101.3+89.2) = 37.3%\nThe memory pressure is also reduced since we did not have to load all data into heap when converting v8 to
