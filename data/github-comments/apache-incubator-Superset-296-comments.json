After this I've returned to the main superset repo, linked the package and then modified `superset/assets/src/visualizations/presets/MainPreset.js` to ensure `new-viz` is being called in the same manner as the other visualisations. Webpack has no problem building with my new visualisation included, but it has no effect on what is actually available in the 'Select a visualization type' window.\r\n\r\nI can't find anywhere else that needs configuration updated and can't find any documentation on how to do this with the new visualisation structure.
