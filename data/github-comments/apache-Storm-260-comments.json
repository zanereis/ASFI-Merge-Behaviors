If there is a loop in the graph (e.g. C subscribes to a steam from D above) then the stateful bolt wrapper queues tuples until it receives a state command message on the checkpoint stream.   Because C will not forward tuples until it receives one on each channel, D never receives the tuple to forward back to C.  It is clear from your comment you did not test this, as it is trivial to reproduce.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612965239/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612968193","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/5989#issuecomment-2612968193","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/5989","id":2612968193,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI5NjgxOTM=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-18T19:26:54Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T16:48:35Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=logikz\">logikz</a>:</i>\n<p>I believe this is a race condition between acking a message as soon as the topology comes online versus initialization of the kafka spout to insert the topic partitions in the ack topic map.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612968193/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/261690443","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1679#issuecomment-261690443","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1679","id":261690443,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTY5MDQ0Mw==","user":{"login":"harshach","id":38649,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NjQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38649?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach","html_url":"https://github.com/harshach","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-19T03:36:50Z","updated_at":"2016-11-19T03:36:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the patch @jfenc91 and for being patient with reviews.\nMerged into master.

That evolved from `ReferenceMap` to `MapMaker` to optimize space, especially in regards to computations (no need for a `Future` wrapper). Unfortunately soft references result in awful performance outside of a micro-benchmark due to causing full GCs. In parallel, I had been experimenting with approaches for a concurrent LRU cache ([CLHM](https://github.com/ben-manes/concurrentlinkedhashmap)) and when joining Google helped to retrofitted its ideas onto Guava. There was a lot of good that came out of that, but I left before working on optimizing for performance.\r\n\r\nJava 8 provided an excuse to start from scratch. Caffeine is much faster and packs in even more features. I also spent time exploring eviction policies, which led to co-authoring a paper on a new technique called TinyLFU. That has a near optimal hit rate, low memory footprint, and amortized O(1) overhead. This is done by tracking frequency in a popularity sketch. The same concurrency model in CLHM and Guava is used (inspired by a write-ahead log), which allows for concurrent O(1) reads and writes.\r\n\r\nThe [HighScalability article](http://highscalability.com/blog/2016/1/25/design-of-a-modern-cache.html) provides an overview of the algorithms that I

Opinions are completely on my own.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, I'm not a big fan of test coverage for such a complicated thing. What we call 'critical' is often from race condition, and I'm not sure these things can be covered from tests. I agree that testable things should have tests so always good to have tests, but there're still edge cases.\r\n\r\nWe have Travis CI for checking the unit tests and some integration tests. We're manually testing the patch before checking in unless there's a small change so don't need to be tested. Basic manual integration tests are done from voters while voting for release. Two things we don't have are automatic system tests and automatic performance tests, as it's very hard to get stable result automatically, and also we don't have INFRA to construct.\r\n\r\nAlong with Apache Storm community, there're enterprise customers as well and I guess service vendors are fixing reported bugs fast and these are also contributed to Apache Storm as well.
