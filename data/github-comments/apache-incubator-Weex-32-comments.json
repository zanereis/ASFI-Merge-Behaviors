This policy is google mandatory, starting at 2019/08/01, each 32-bit native so library must have a corresponding 64-bit, otherwise it is not possible to release updates All new apps and app updates that include native code are required to provide 64 -bit versions in addition to 32-bit versions when publishing to Google Play Given the time constraints, 64-bit support is no longer a feature, but a bug that will affect developers in the future, mainly to conduct business overseas, googleplay released App. I hope to provide a 64-bit native library as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nPlease subscribe [weex mailing list](https://weex.apache.org/guide/contribute/how-to-contribute.html#mailing-list) where this issue is already discussed.\r\n\r\nFYI: As 64 bit support is in early stage, I can't give you a specified schedule yet. What I can tell you is that we will launch 64 bit support before 1st, August, 2019. Please subscribe [weex mailing list](https://weex.apache.org/guide/contribute/how-to-contribute.html#mailing-list), we will announce such features in mailing list.
