I thought that `keras` was a dependency of TF, because it was in the `ubuntu_install_tensorflow.sh` script, and that the removal of the pinned version of keras was part of the same issue that required the pinned h5py version.  I was wrong, and the keras installation was separate from the installation of TF, but depends on TF.\r\n\r\nIt looks like the standalone-keras is only used if we're importing a keras model that isn't a tensorflow model.

So if we run it where Arm CPU is enabled it will test it automatically.\r\n> \r\n> The only problem could be that it is a bit long-running as it has more than 350 test cases but we could think of creating a fast running mode too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGot it - yes I could just reproduce the failure with that test but as you say I did have to add 'llvm -device=arm_cpu' to the devices list as you said to see the AssertionError failure, so may be the solution here is that we add 'llvm -device=arm_cpu' to the test here or actually fix the test to only use 'llvm -device=arm_cpu' when running on ci_arm rather than having it run twice on the GPU CI which is where TOPI testing is turned on. \r\n\r\n\r\nI suspect the following things need to happen here to progress this with the tests. \r\n\r\n1. We run the topi tests in Jenkins using the Task script and just turn that on for the CI on AArch64. That is a one liner change and hopefully it works. However while pipe cleaning that on my local machine , I've hit a few testisms in the topi tests that need to be cleaned up. Especially with some tests being suitable only for CUDA but not being marked as so.  I can help with this. That's pretty easy and straightforward but will need buy in from the project that running these tests in AArch64 CI is a good thing ! I think this bug just shows the value of running these tests in CI. I would prefer to start with the entirety of the TOPI tests, it appears to take me about 30-40 minutes on a machine that has similar characteristics to the one in CI.\r\n\r\n2. I agree with you that we should look to add to this PR an additional change to the test script you mention by adding  'llvm -device=arm_cpu' to the list of targets only if one is running the test on AArch64 hardware, otherwise when we come around to doing 1 above we'd be running this test once for the llvm target and once for an llvm -device=arm_cpu and just duplicating testing for a path that is unneeded . For bonus points we should audit the topi test directory and clean it up as we go along because I note that many tests again run for both llvm and llvm -device=arm_cpu which probably just uses more runtime during CI when it is not needed. \r\n\r\n\r\nregards\r\nRamana \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/872585551/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/872670791","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8386#issuecomment-872670791","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8386","id":872670791,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3MjY3MDc5MQ==","user":{"login":"mehrdadh","id":6409345,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MDkzNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6409345?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehrdadh","html_url":"https://github.com/mehrdadh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehrdadh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehrdadh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehrdadh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehrdadh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehrdadh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehrdadh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehrdadh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehrdadh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehrdadh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-02T02:40:13Z","updated_at":"2021-07-02T02:40:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"`test_zephyr` and `test_zephyr_aot` has passed on stm32l4r5zi board on my local machine.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/872670791/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/872754184","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8381#issuecomment-872754184","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8381","id":872754184,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3Mjc1NDE4NA==","user":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-02T06:32:39Z","updated_at":"2021-07-02T06:32:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@echuraev BTW is `intel_graphics` target supposed to be better than the generic `opencl` target?

Therefore, I am proposing back what I have suggested earlier: I duplicate the TVMLastError functionality inside out platform-specific implementation (we do not link c_runtime_api.c) and I'd take care of aligning the c-backend vs c_runtime functionality after that. How about this ?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/872796133/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/872825235","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/8177#issuecomment-872825235","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8177","id":872825235,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3MjgyNTIzNQ==","user":{"login":"leandron","id":437416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzQxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/437416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron","html_url":"https://github.com/leandron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-02T08:37:37Z","updated_at":"2021-07-02T08:37:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> @leandron , were the issues you ran into in #6810 based on using keras 2.3.1 alongside cuda 10.2, and do you know if they would still be present with cuda 11.0?\r\n\r\nThe original discussion was kept in #6754, but my local tests are CPU only, so I don't have any data regarding CUDA versions w.r.t the referred issue.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/872825235/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/872841000","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8305#issuecomment-872841000","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8305","id":872841000,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3Mjg0MTAwMA==","user":{"login":"FrozenGene","id":7287321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyODczMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7287321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene","html_url":"https://github.com/FrozenGene","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-02T09:02:55Z","updated_at":"2021-07-02T09:02:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@mbrookhart I think you should make a new pull request of `test_forward`.

Intel graphics introduce two convolution - NCHWc and packed_data(by fact it is blocked convolution by out channels with further mandatory conversion to planar layout). Both of these convolutions had accuracy issue, I fixed it with only for packed_data and !PR8201 was accepted, but have not fixed accuracy of NCHWc yet\r\n2. The compute for IG conv2d_NCHWc assumes different flows depending on parameters for scheduling selected by AUTOTVM. it sometimes can add repack by spacial dimentions, sometimes do not add. and AutoTVM using default tuner aborts tuning with claiming of different number of features. This is another reason why I have not created PR yet - NCHWc should be significantly modified and I wanted to make sure that I do not break anything valuable\r\n3. I would say that in many cases NCHWc kernels themselves are better than generic OpenCL, but often additional conversion of data into NCHWc<-> NCHW eats all performance boost and even make topology work slower\r\n4. I have not finished comparison on UHD630. On the same time I see 2x slowdown on this platform comparing to competitors. Wanted to take a look into this as well.\r\n5. Probably it would be more correct way to add `model` distinguishing UHD and IrisXE in addition to the `-device=intel_graphics`, but there are several independent places in TVM dealing with device/model and it's hard for me to figure out the right scope of changes for adding model\r\n\r\nSeveral more questions to you\r\n1. which topologies have you used for your experiment with Skylake graphics? \r\n2. can you try to tune with `target=\"opencl -device=intel_graphics\"`?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/872864628/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/872891424","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8381#issuecomment-872891424","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8381","id":872891424,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3Mjg5MTQyNA==","user":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-02T10:22:41Z","updated_at":"2021-07-02T10:23:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Interesting!

Quite enlightened with your POV now.\r\nI believe most of the points we both concur.\r\nHowever below are some points where  my POV differs.\r\n\r\nAs you have taken example of \"TFLite_PostProcess_Detection\". I will consider that to state my point.\r\n   I agree this Op is not part of Tensorflow Op mainstream and they use flatbuffer to create it. \r\n   But this Op is created using standard APIs from user perspective, today it is created with features x, y, h, w (just to explain) when the TF model SSD operations are present as part of it.\r\n   Now consider later on, when this SSD support has to be upgraded from [x, y, h, w] to [x, y, w, h], which is done because there was a limitation in SSD op support. Now this limitation was visible at higher layers operation, not in the model creation. \r\n   So, in that case, the flatbuffer implemented \"TFLite_PostProcess_Detection\" in TVM will become obsolete implementation. And it will be very difficult to findout the reason, unless you are looking into the flatbuffer custom op implemenation in Tensorflow / TLite MLIR compiler project.\r\n   Now above scenario is the failure of TFLite parser I am trying to project here, if it is validated using TVM flatbuffer implementation.  This issue can be avoided easily if we use standard APIs and the standard models which are created using those.\r\n\r\n   Also, TFLite converters are the standard entry points into the world of TFLite and they are stable w.r.t. their own domain of versions(for some operators the dev takes time and it gets stretched through versions). But there is no TFLite standard(highlight) model exists which has bypassed it. \r\n  \r\n\r\nNOTE: I do clearly understand that testing using standard APIs like (TF/Keras Op creation and convert to TFLite) is quite exorbitant, but this is the necessary price we have to pay:) . If we do not do that there will be always a possibility for gap in our CI evaluations.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we really need this flatbuffer implementation for a comparatively easier testing approach, we should use this as a last resort.\r\nWe should not use it, until it is really difficult to reproduce the scenario using standard APIs. But I am afraid, if we start using this flatbuffer framework to write test cases, then we might not be able to maintain the sanctity.\r\n\r\nNOTE: TFLite Schema gets updated very frequently, so maintenance cost for each version upgrade sometimes will be more, if we follow this approach.\r\n\r\nI really appreciate all the hard work you have done! \r\nIt is quite clearly visible. I am extremely sorry for not able to vote in favor of the change. \r\nBut I leave to other members in TVM for their expert opinions.\r\n\r\nThanks again for your efforts!!!\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/873047771/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/873055782","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/8177#issuecomment-873055782","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8177","id":873055782,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3MzA1NTc4Mg==","user":{"login":"leandron","id":437416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzQxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/437416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron","html_url":"https://github.com/leandron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-02T14:49:25Z","updated_at":"2021-07-02T14:49:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"On a CPU-only machine, **all frontend tests pass with** the following combination:\r\n`tensorflow==2.4.2 keras==2.4.3`\r\n\r\nThere is no need to pin `h5py` (which, out of curiosity, installs version `2.10.0`)\r\n\r\ncc @mbrookhart @Lunderberg ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/873055782/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/873064005","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/8177#issuecomment-873064005","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8177","id":873064005,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3MzA2NDAwNQ==","user":{"login":"mbrookhart","id":4065489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNjU0ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4065489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart","html_url":"https://github.com/mbrookhart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-02T15:01:28Z","updated_at":"2021-07-02T15:01:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you!\r\n\r\nIt looks like which version of h5py you get might depend on your pip version:\r\n```\r\n-> % pip install h5py  \r\nCollecting h5py\r\n  Downloading h5py-3.3.0-cp38-cp38-manylinux_2_12_x86_64.manylinux2010_x86_64.whl (4.5 MB)\r\n```\r\nI think we should keep that constraint in there.

However, I think the schema is now intended to be stable and versioned with a proper deprecation process in place for changes of behaviour (like in your PostProcess example) and to be backwards compatible where appropriate. Therefore, if we can prove we support the operators in the schema (with these tests), we have good confidence we'll support everything the converters throw at us.\r\n\r\nI'll ping @mshawcroft and

operators.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/873293622/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/873299628","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8395#issuecomment-873299628","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8395","id":873299628,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3MzI5OTYyOA==","user":{"login":"mehrdadh","id":6409345,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MDkzNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6409345?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehrdadh","html_url":"https://github.com/mehrdadh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehrdadh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehrdadh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehrdadh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehrdadh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehrdadh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehrdadh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehrdadh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehrdadh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehrdadh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-02T23:17:19Z","updated_at":"2021-07-02T23:17:19Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"cc

I think you need to expand these to also support .dylib.\r\n\r\nI double-checked and `.dylib` is already supported. We use the modified functions `GenerateUntarCommand`, `LinuxShared` and `CreateShared` only in the function `BuildSharedLibrary` (https://github.com/echuraev/tvm/blob/echuraev/fix_cpp_rpc/apps/cpp_rpc/rpc_env.cc#L292). Function `BuildSharedLibrary` returns the name of the file which will be used in `Module::LoadFromFile` (https://github.com/echuraev/tvm/blob/echuraev/fix_cpp_rpc/apps/cpp_rpc/rpc_env.cc#L129). \r\n\r\nIn case when we would like to load `dylib` the `BuildSharedLibrary` should return the name of the `dylib` library. And it works in this way. [Here](https://github.com/echuraev/tvm/blob/echuraev/fix_cpp_rpc/apps/cpp_rpc/rpc_env.cc#L315) we return the name of the `dylib` library. We could do it explicitly by adding a condition (such as: `|| support::EndsWith(file, \".dylib\")`) [here](https://github.com/echuraev/tvm/blob/echuraev/fix_cpp_rpc/apps/cpp_rpc/rpc_env.cc#L293).

Waiting for your adding full transpose support for `nn.batch_matmul`!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/873933081/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/873969006","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8400#issuecomment-873969006","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8400","id":873969006,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3Mzk2OTAwNg==","user":{"login":"leandron","id":437416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzQxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/437416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron","html_url":"https://github.com/leandron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-05T09:42:14Z","updated_at":"2021-07-05T09:42:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm not 100% sure that #8394 needs to be reverted, considering that there is evidence of the tests passing today: https://ci.tlcpack.ai/blue/organizations/jenkins/tvm/detail/PR-8402/3/pipeline.\r\n\r\nIt might as well be a transient.

it might help for us to have a higher-bandwidth discussion on this topic (we can place the results in this thread). if you want to contact me on the [discord](https://tvm.apache.org/community) we may be able to come to a plan more quickly. \r\n\r\ninitially my thoughts were that, since this PR was contributing a new implementation of c_backend_api and the API surface was considerably different than what is in `src/runtime/micro`, there were enough pieces similar to `src/runtime/crt` that it made sense to place it with the CRT. however, as we've been aligning on this PR, it now seems like we've been able to accommodate any platform differences for STM32 using the standard TVM C runtime plus the TVMPlatform APIs. i think this PR now has these pieces:\r\n1. a code generator to produce the STM32-facing API from a Model Library Format artifact\r\n2. implementation of the TVMPlatform APIs\r\n3. implementations of the types used by STM32 API\r\n4. unit tests for the above\r\n\r\nSo now it seems like pieces 1-3 more naturally belong alongside those for the other microTVM platforms (Zephyr and Arduino (soon)). With the [Project API PR](https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8380), it's proposed to move that code to `apps/microtvm/<platform>`. I'm happy to consider other proposals for where it should live, too. Or, if you plan to contribute more pieces later on that might change the picture a bit, we could consider another home for this code.\r\n\r\nI did want note that although support for these platforms is compartmentalized outside of `src` in the TVM codebase, we still test them as much as is feasible in the TVM CI so that we can consider them first-class integrations of TVM. There is precedent in TVM for doing this (e.g. `apps/bundle_deploy`, which is the recommended way to build a static POSIX binary to deploy TVM code), so I would think that the CI should protect them from bitrot.\r\n\r\nAnother benefit is that it places all of the stm-specific code in a single location. this makes it easier for reviewers to tell when to CC you guys on PRs that originate from the community but which modify the STM32 code. TVM doesn't have a codified [CODEOWNERS](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/about-code-owners) but it still nonetheless helps to have clearly-delineated code.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think--it'd be great to align on this last piece!\r\n\r\n-Andrew","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/875270854/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/875297559","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/8177#issuecomment-875297559","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8177","id":875297559,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3NTI5NzU1OQ==","user":{"login":"mbrookhart","id":4065489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNjU0ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4065489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart","html_url":"https://github.com/mbrookhart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-07T05:37:15Z","updated_at":"2021-07-07T05:37:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The images are built and running, but I'm hitting a few more TF issues.
