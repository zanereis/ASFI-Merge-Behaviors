Nice Jenkins Job btw ;)\n\nI see three LGTM's, two of which are based on code review, one on running integration tests (which showed nothing broke). I tested the changes in a physical setup, with S3 storage facilities. It does the same as before, so the refactor went well.\n\nDo we merge, or wait for someone else to test? @wido @remibergsma @wilderrodrigues \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/158344376/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/158346095","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1086#issuecomment-158346095","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1086","id":158346095,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1ODM0NjA5NQ==","user":{"login":"koushik-das","id":11499860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk5ODYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11499860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das","html_url":"https://github.com/koushik-das","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-20T10:08:39Z","updated_at":"2015-11-20T10:08:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ustcweizhou Some questions.\n1.
