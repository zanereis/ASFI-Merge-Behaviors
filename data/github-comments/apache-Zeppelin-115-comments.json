went ahead and changed parsing of the \"explore\" keyword to use `split(\" +\")` instead of substring so that it wasn't tied to any particular word length etc.. and the `METADATA_KEYWORD` can be set to any single case-insensitive word.\r\n\r\nAs an additional detail, if you look up a table that doesn't exist you'll just get an empty table in the paragraph as opposed to an explicit error message. I experimented a bit with testing for an empty result set using `resultSet.next()` and `resultSet.first()` so that I could output an error message like \"Database object not found\". \r\n\r\nHowever, it seems that when getting metadata, since you're not using `Statement`, this kind of thing causes problems because re-setting cursors on the resultset using methods like `resultSet.beforeFirst()` isn't supported for all data sources. I don't want to use `Statement` because I want to have this abstracted away from SQL and simply use the JDBC api to get metadata. So, in the interest of making this as general of a feature as possible, and therefore not using `Statement`, as well as not having a good way to test for `resultSet` emptiness that is adequately vendor-agnostic, there currently isn't testing for empty result sets, they just return as empty tables.\r\n\r\nI don't imagine this is an issue really but if anyone has a suggestion of a good way to do this, I'd be very interested to hear it!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/267869095/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/267870304","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1731#issuecomment-267870304","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1731","id":267870304,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2Nzg3MDMwNA==","user":{"login":"bzz","id":5582506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1ODI1MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5582506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz","html_url":"https://github.com/bzz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-19T02:47:15Z","updated_at":"2016-12-19T02:49:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thank you @cuspymd @felizbear \r\nLooks great to me.

It's really useful feature indeed. \r\nFor the quick review, it would be better to edit PR title to sth like \"[ZEPPELIN-727] Enable to jump to specific paragraph using anchor\" instead of just \"ZEPPELIN 727\". Then other ppl can recognize what this PR implemented at a glance.\r\n\r\nI tested and it works well as you described. Here are some my thoughts \r\n\r\n1. In my case, couldn't get the difference between ![screen shot 2016-12-20 at 11 54 50 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/21336801/26e2b028-c6ab-11e6-983f-fe2a4ad40d6a.png)\r\n and ![screen shot 2016-12-20 at 11 54 16 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/21336782/13ac1558-c6ab-11e6-8469-7bf25f557043.png) at the first time. Probably some users will be same with me. I know \"Link this paragraph\" is existed one, but \"Publish this paragraph with iframe\" instead of \"Link this paragraph\" would be more precise to prevent any confusion.\r\n\r\n2. With this PR, we need to \r\nClick gear icon -> Click \"Link to paragraph in context\" menu  -> Ctrl+C and enter to copy the paragraph url -> Open new tab -> Paste the url \r\n\r\nIMPO using anchor has to be simple. Let's say we need specific paragraph url to give this location to someone. e.g. in Zeppelin official docs site,\r\n![anchor](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/21336999/c9d913b6-c6ac-11e6-8a1e-eda656f379f9.gif)\r\n\r\nThe icon is exposed in the outside(need mouse hovering) and we can instinctively recognize what it is. \r\n\r\nSo i think it would be better the anchor icon can be exposed in the outside not in the dropdown menu. And after we click that icon, the url will be exposed in the top header bar like I posted in the above, or maybe automatically copied right after we click it (please refer to #1750 ).\r\n\r\nIt's just my opinion in my head. So please take with grain of salt and feel free to share your thought! :D\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/268145123/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/268147562","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1738#issuecomment-268147562","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1738","id":268147562,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2ODE0NzU2Mg==","user":{"login":"AhyoungRyu","id":10060731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYwNzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10060731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu","html_url":"https://github.com/AhyoungRyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-20T03:49:22Z","updated_at":"2016-12-20T03:49:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bitchelov Did you have a chance to look into [this comment](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1839?focusedCommentId=15761118&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-15761118) by @zjffdu ?
