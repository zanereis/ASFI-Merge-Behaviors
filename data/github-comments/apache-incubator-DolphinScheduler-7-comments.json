Implement export/import, using export to excel, which leads us to introduce poi-ooxml as a huge dependency (for example, it relies on a lot of xml libraries)\r\n  2. Added hutool-all dependency. This dependent license is the Mulan protocol. This ASF estimates that the protocol is not yet compliant, and it is not very good to rely on hutool-all instead of the specific module itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nother questions:\r\n\r\n1. When exporting, the schedule defined by the process will be exported at the same time, and the schedule will be created when creating. This is not necessarily necessary for export/import. It is better to be configurable.\r\n\r\n2. Many resources are open with try-with-resources, such as:\r\n\r\n      Public Map<String, Object> importProcessDefinition(User loginUser, MultipartFile file) { In the function, reader = ExcelUtil.getReader(file.getInputStream()); It is possible to not close the resource.\r\n\r\n3. When importing, create ProcessDefinition is directly new ProcessDefinition, and directly set the value of each field, it is best to use existing methods, such as: ProcessDefinitionService.createProcessDefinition, instead of directly copying an existing logic to ProcessDefinitionService.importProcessDefinition\r\n\r\n4. A lot of code similar to map.get(\"scheduleReleaseState\") != null && map.get(\"scheduleReleaseState\") != \"\" can be changed to: StringUtils.isNotEmpty\r\n\r\n5. Excel is written in xlsx format:\r\n    Writer.write(rows, true);\r\n    response.setHeader(\"Content-Disposition\", \"attachment;filename=test.xlsx\");\r\n   The file name read by js is [processDefinitionName].xls :\r\n    Let fileName = `${fileNameS}.xls`\r\n\r\n6. When the front end uploads, setTimeout is used. This seems to be unnecessary. I don't know if it will cause the memory leak on the js side (timer etc. can easily cause js memory problems)\r\n\r\n          this._formDataUpdate().then(res => {\r\n            setTimeout(() => {\r\n              This.$refs['popup'].spinnerLoading = false\r\n            }, 800)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n初步的一些建议:\r\n\r\n主要问题:\r\n  1. 实现导出/导入, 使用了导出到 excel, 这个导致我们需要引入 poi-ooxml 这个 巨大的依赖(比如其依赖了很多xml库)\r\n  2. 新加了 hutool-all 这个依赖, 这个依赖的license是 木兰协议, 这个ASF 估计还没有研究这个协议是否合规, 而且依赖hutool-all 而不是具体的模块本身也不是很好\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n其它问题:\r\n\r\n1. 导出时, 同时会导出该 流程定义 的 定时 (schedule),  而创建时也会新建 schedule, 这个不一定是导出/导入所必须的, 最好能做成可以配置的? \r\n\r\n2. 很多资源打开最好用 try-with-resources, 比如:\r\n\r\n      public Map<String, Object> importProcessDefinition(User loginUser, MultipartFile file) {  函数中,  reader = ExcelUtil.getReader(file.getInputStream());  有可能不关闭资源.\r\n\r\n3. 导入时, 创建ProcessDefinition是直接new ProcessDefinition, 并直接设置各个字段值, 最好能用现有方法, 比如: ProcessDefinitionService.createProcessDefinition , 而不是直接copy一份现有逻辑到 ProcessDefinitionService.importProcessDefinition\r\n\r\n4. 很多类似于  map.get(\"scheduleReleaseState\") != null && map.get(\"scheduleReleaseState\") != \"\" 的代码可以改为:  StringUtils.isNotEmpty\r\n\r\n5. Excel写的时候是xlsx格式: \r\n    writer.write(rows, true);\r\n    response.setHeader(\"Content-Disposition\", \"attachment;filename=test.xlsx\");\r\n   js端读取的文件命名是   [processDefinitionName].xls :\r\n    let fileName = `${fileNameS}.xls`\r\n\r\n6. 前端上传时, 使用了 setTimeout, 这个好像没有必要, 不知道会不会引起js端的memory leak (timer等很容易造成js内存问题) \r\n\r\n          this._formDataUpdate().then(res => {\r\n            setTimeout(() => {\r\n              this.$refs['popup'].spinnerLoading = false\r\n            }, 800)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/522448744/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/522448797","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/701#issuecomment-522448797","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/701","id":522448797,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMjQ0ODc5Nw==","user":{"login":"William-GuoWei","id":25520639,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NTIwNjM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25520639?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/William-GuoWei","html_url":"https://github.com/William-GuoWei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/William-GuoWei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/William-GuoWei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/William-GuoWei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/William-GuoWei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/William-GuoWei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/William-GuoWei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/William-GuoWei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/William-GuoWei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/William-GuoWei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-19T07:31:43Z","updated_at":"2019-08-19T07:31:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I

\r\n实现导出/导入, 使用了导出到 excel, 这个导致我们需要引入 poi-ooxml 这个 巨大的依赖(比如其依赖了很多xml库)\r\n \r\n新加了 hutool-all 这个依赖, 这个依赖的license是 木兰协议, 这个ASF 估计还没有研究这个协议是否合规, 而且依赖hutool-all 而不是具体的模块本身也不是很好\r\n  \r\n其它问题:\r\n  \r\n \r\n导出时, 同时会导出该 流程定义 的 定时 (schedule),  而创建时也会新建 schedule, 这个不一定是导出/导入所必须的, 最好能做成可以配置的?\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n很多资源打开最好用 try-with-resources, 比如:\r\n \r\npublic Map<String, Object> importProcessDefinition(User loginUser, MultipartFile file) {  函数中,  reader = ExcelUtil.getReader(file.getInputStream());  有可能不关闭资源.\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n导入时, 创建ProcessDefinition是直接new ProcessDefinition, 并直接设置各个字段值, 最好能用现有方法, 比如: ProcessDefinitionService.createProcessDefinition , 而不是直接copy一份现有逻辑到 ProcessDefinitionService.importProcessDefinition\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n很多类似于  map.get(\"scheduleReleaseState\") != null && map.get(\"scheduleReleaseState\") != \"\" 的代码可以改为:  StringUtils.isNotEmpty\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nExcel写的时候是xlsx格式:\r\n writer.write(rows, true);\r\n response.setHeader(\"Content-Disposition\", \"attachment;filename=test.xlsx\");\r\n js端读取的文件命名是   [processDefinitionName].xls :\r\n let fileName = ${fileNameS}.xls\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n前端上传时, 使用了 setTimeout, 这个好像没有必要, 不知道会不会引起js端的memory leak (timer等很容易造成js内存问题)\r\n    this._formDataUpdate().then(res => {      setTimeout(() => {        this.$refs['popup'].spinnerLoading = false      }, 800)
