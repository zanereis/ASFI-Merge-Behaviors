there been an RFC posted btw? This comment probably belongs there. \r\n\r\nFWIW I'm a little concerned about some directions this PR is taking, or at least some use-cases that would be good to see handled that I don't see how they fit in currently.\r\n\r\nFor background on my perspective, a standard training flow for quantized models in TF/C2 (at least the fwk's I'm familiar with that implement this), is to:\r\n\r\n1.  Implement a model in a standard ML framework, generally using fp16/bfloat16/fp32 compute precision as this has highest throughput on most commonly-used training hardware.\r\n1. (optionally) insert fake quantization (here, called simulated quantization) nodes at quantization boundaries (i.e. if your backend implements a fused Int8Conv + Int8Relu, you'd insert them after a Conv + Relu block), to simulate the quantization numerics at training time.\r\n1. Train the model as usual\r\n1. Implement a graph rewriting pass (i.e. TF's toco, C2's int8_converter, MXNet's quantization, etc) that rewrites the graph to target the int8 operators directly — i.e. remapping subgraphs of e.g. FP32Conv + FP32Relu to be a fused Int8ConvRelu operator. This requires computing output quantization parameters at requantization boundaries, which can be done either by\r\n    - calibration to an example set of activations, via e.g. l-p norm or kl minimization (c2/tf/mxnet/tensorrt)\r\n    - using activation ranges learned during training (c2/tf).\r\n1. Using this quantized graph, evaluate various metrics to verify the quantization-induced error/loss is acceptable.\r\n1. Deploy the quantized graph.\r\n\r\nDoes this workflow make sense to folks? If not, could folks please elaborate on where we differ?\r\n\r\nGiven this flow, we'd like to insert TVM into this process. One key use case that I'd like TVM to consider supporting is to allow frameworks to continue to use their existing approaches for Steps 1-5, and involve TVM in Step 6.  There are several reasons for this, such as calibration-based quantization isn't always sufficient, and we'd like to supporting importing from existing int8 graph IRs like TFLite or C2.\r\n\r\nI think requiring TVM to take on Steps 4 and 5 in order to implement quantized models is unnecessarily opinionated, and moves it towards being a fully-fledged framework in it's own right (which I thought was not the goal).\r\n\r\nI would have thought one natural (and minimalistic) direction for TVM to support quantized models (which isn't precluded by this diff, but I want to see what folks think about this) would be something like:\r\n\r\n1. Implement (in topi) support for int8 ops (i.e. ((u)int8 inputs, int32 accumulation, int32 output). This is partially done already by the great work from folks in the community. If we generalize to asymmetric quantization (which IMO is quite important), then it's arguably more natural to represent the inputs/outputs as tuples of (uint8 tensor, float min, float max) or equivalently (uint8 tensor, int32 bias, float scale), and implement operators using this representation.\r\n1. Add some kind of requantize op in NNVM, that performs a int32 -> (u)int8 requantization with the appropriate output float min/float max obtained via calibration or training.\r\n1. Implement in nnvm frontend an importer for e.g. tflite models (which would mostly involve mapping ops like TFLiteConv into a nnvm::Conv + nnvm::Requantize sequence, and ensuring that TVM/NNVM fuse away sequences of requantize/pointwise/requantize), and demonstrate a) bitwise numerical equivalence, and b) speedups vs tflite's runtime for models like MobileNetV2 or similar.\r\n\r\nConcretely, my concerns with this approach (assuming the goal is to be the 'the one true way' to execute quantized models in TVM) are that it a) integrates too early in the pipeline, which unnecessarily requires some assumptions, and b) these assumptions aren't the most general ones (i.e. requires symmetric quantization as used by e.g. MKLDNN), which precludes asymmetric quantization as in TF, TFLite, C2, GEMMLOWP, QNNPACK, and channel-wise quantization as in TF/C2 which is very useful for pushing bitwidths lower (see e.g. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08342.pdf), and c) is less modular than other approaches, which makes it harder to target from existing frameworks that already support quantization. \r\n\r\nI don't think our goals are in conflict, I just thought that I should put this on the radar. Happy to send out an RFC (and dedicate engineering effort) to the more alternative approach as well if folks are on board?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/444694200/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/444710967","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2189#issuecomment-444710967","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2189","id":444710967,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NDcxMDk2Nw==","user":{"login":"slyubomirsky","id":5624871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MjQ4NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5624871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky","html_url":"https://github.com/slyubomirsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-06T01:09:53Z","updated_at":"2018-12-06T01:09:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jroesch @MarisaKirisame I think the cases you showed me will require changes to type inference, rather than the solver.

This need to be addressed properly by ordering argument in the SplitDeviceCode pass. However, there is no strictly one to one mapping. Consider the following case, which can be generated by adding two tensors together(with the same length).\r\n\r\n```c\r\nvoid device_func(void* data1, void* data2, int n) {\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid host_func(DLTensor* x1, DLTensor*x2) {\r\n  void* ptr1 = x1->data;\r\n  void* ptr2 = x2->data;\r\n  int n = x1->shape[0];\r\n  int n2 = x2->shape[0];\r\n  assert(n == n2);\r\n  device_func(ptr1, ptr2, n);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can find that the signature in device_func does not directly correspond to the arguments in the host_func. In the best case, we can define a rule, for example, ptr1 traces back to x1, ptr2 traces back to x2, and we order them as ptr1 and ptr2, but how should we order n is an interesting question.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/444737473/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/444740182","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2221#issuecomment-444740182","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2221","id":444740182,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NDc0MDE4Mg==","user":{"login":"srkreddy1238","id":14215163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjE1MTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14215163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238","html_url":"https://github.com/srkreddy1238","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-06T03:56:34Z","updated_at":"2018-12-06T03:56:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ashutoshparkhi
