I'm not sure to let the `TableSourceScan` has this kind of information, i'd prefer to let them stay within the all kinds of `TableSource`. One drawback to let `TableSourceScan` has such kind of information is when we do the `TableSourceScan` copy, we need to take care all these information, make sure they also be copied correctly. In the future, if we add more extension to `TableSource` like we can push part of query down, we will face this problem. \r\n\r\nRegarding to the interface of `FilterableTableSource`, i agree with you that the trait containing some logic is not friendly with java extensions. So i removed the default implementation of `isFilterPushedDown`, the inherited class should take care of this method. And regarding the `Tuple2` thing, how about we pass in a mutable java list, and let table source to ***pick out*** expression from it and return a copy of table source which contains these pushed down predicates.

Just like description of this JIRA. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/286978512/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/286991418","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3151#issuecomment-286991418","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3151","id":286991418,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4Njk5MTQxOA==","user":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-16T08:40:10Z","updated_at":"2017-03-16T08:40:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @zhijiangW, I'm currently merging the PR.

The filter pushdown flag might not be the only one. Let's keep this information in `FilterableTableScan`. \r\n\r\nI'm not so sure about the interface of `applyPredicate(predicates: JList[Expression])`. I think we should not ask users to remove the accepted Expressions from the `predicates` list. How about we add a method `getPredicates(): JList[Expression]` which returns the accepted expressions. This method could also replace `isFilterPushedDown` if we expect `null` if `getPredicates()` was not called and an empty list if it was called but no predicate was accepted. IMO, `getPredicates()` has also the advantage that we can check that the `FilterableTableSource` did not modify the accepted predicates.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/287024982/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/287028338","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3379#issuecomment-287028338","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3379","id":287028338,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NzAyODMzOA==","user":{"login":"lincoln-lil","id":3712895,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MTI4OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3712895?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lincoln-lil","html_url":"https://github.com/lincoln-lil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lincoln-lil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lincoln-lil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lincoln-lil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lincoln-lil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lincoln-lil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lincoln-lil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lincoln-lil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lincoln-lil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lincoln-lil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-16T11:19:58Z","updated_at":"2017-03-16T11:19:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi fhueske,  I'm OK with the schedule and thanks for following this pr.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/287028338/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/287043421","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3406#issuecomment-287043421","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3406","id":287043421,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NzA0MzQyMQ==","user":{"login":"beyond1920","id":1525333,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjUzMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1525333?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beyond1920","html_url":"https://github.com/beyond1920","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beyond1920/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beyond1920/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beyond1920/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beyond1920/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beyond1920/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beyond1920/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beyond1920/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beyond1920/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beyond1920/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-16T12:34:08Z","updated_at":"2017-03-16T12:41:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@twalthr, @fhueske  , thanks for the reviews.

When I realized the heartbeat logic between different components like TM and JM, it is a little difficult to control the process between threads in order to verify the timeout expectation in tests. Now the `HeartbeatListener` is exposed out of the world, the test can extend the `notifyHeartbeatTimeout` method to control the process more easily.\r\n\r\nAnd I also notice that you change the `sendHeartbeat` to `receiveHeartbeat`, have you considered to use `responseHeartbeat` instead which is constract with `requestHeartbeat`.\r\n\r\nBTW, what is your suggestions of my current pull requests related with this modification?

We never defined whether such \"environment-specific behavior\" is considered part of the stability contract or not.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/287126700/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/287128947","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3483#issuecomment-287128947","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3483","id":287128947,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NzEyODk0Nw==","user":{"login":"StefanRRichter","id":2128543,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjg1NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2128543?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter","html_url":"https://github.com/StefanRRichter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-16T17:18:26Z","updated_at":"2017-03-16T17:18:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the review, @aljoscha.

Use `git rebase` to rebase your commits on the latest master.\r\n\r\nBest, Fabian","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/287204309/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/287239409","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3503#issuecomment-287239409","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3503","id":287239409,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NzIzOTQwOQ==","user":{"login":"sunjincheng121","id":22488084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDg4MDg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22488084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121","html_url":"https://github.com/sunjincheng121","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-17T01:13:46Z","updated_at":"2017-03-17T01:13:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"HI,guys, Welcome anyone to review this PR.\r\n@StephanEwen Can you continue review this PR.\r\nBest，\r\nSunJIncheng","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/287239409/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/287245382","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3520#issuecomment-287245382","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3520","id":287245382,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NzI0NTM4Mg==","user":{"login":"KurtYoung","id":955396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1NTM5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/955396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KurtYoung","html_url":"https://github.com/KurtYoung","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KurtYoung/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KurtYoung/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KurtYoung/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KurtYoung/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KurtYoung/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KurtYoung/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KurtYoung/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KurtYoung/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KurtYoung/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-17T01:55:49Z","updated_at":"2017-03-17T01:55:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @fhueske, thanks for the review.

This broadcast state will provide an interface very similar to the current keyed state (we'll probably reuse the descriptors and state interfaces) but be checkpointed only on one operator because we only allow modifications based on broadcast input.\r\n\r\nI propose to rename the state we're talking about here to `UnionState` (or something) similar because what it does is take the snapshotted state from all operators and when restoring sends the union of that to all operators.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/287325157/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/287325264","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3508#issuecomment-287325264","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3508","id":287325264,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NzMyNTI2NA==","user":{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-17T10:57:04Z","updated_at":"2017-03-17T10:57:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 on not exposing the Java Serialisation shortcut, btw.
