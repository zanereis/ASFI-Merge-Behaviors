\r\nA few points about the slow startup.\r\nWhen you explicitly specify which fields you really need the system will completely 'not load' the rules that have no impact. Especially if you do not need the DeviceBrand/DeviceName the impact will be quite large. You can simply pass something like this .withField(\"AgentName\") .withField(\"DeviceClass\") .withField(\"AgentVersion\") and it will have a big impact on both startup times and run times for a not yet cached parse.\r\n\r\nI had a look at your project and with this patch the startup time drops to less than 1.5 seconds.\r\n\r\n```\r\n15:30:01,824 [INFO ] YauaaVersion                            :

API.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/400012550/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/400020894","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/wicket/pull/275#issuecomment-400020894","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/275","id":400020894,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMDAyMDg5NA==","user":{"login":"solomax","id":3870591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NzA1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3870591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax","html_url":"https://github.com/solomax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-25T16:52:50Z","updated_at":"2018-06-25T16:52:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I

then you're left with checking at each step (`getLazyLoadComponent`/`onContentLoaded`) whether or not something properly loaded.  \r\nThat kind of defeats the purpose to have a single place that's used to check the state of the content (`contentState`).\r\nI could pull out the contents of `contentState` into a method, but then now I'm just working around `AjaxLazyLoadPanel`.\r\nEven more annoying if the check itself isn't cheap.\r\nGranted, I could cache the check, and all of that jazz, but then I've just implemented a chunk of the book keeping that `AjazLazyLoadPanel` could do already at no cost.\r\n\r\nNot every one will end up using this functionality, but I dare say a lot of the people who are doing proper parallel stuff with this panel might find it easier to deal with

most people will want to show different contents depending on the result of lazy loading - I doubt that anyone would want to give up polling but keep the loading anymation - so they will need to transfer the result from isContentReady() to getLazyLoadComponent() anyways. I don't like to use an enum for that, as this will lead to even more enum values. It's just simpler to keep this information as a member variable.\r\nWe could have joined isContentReady() and getLazyLoadComponent() into a single method, but I tried to keep the API somewhat similar to 7.x.\r\n\r\nRegarding the initial update interval: yes, I agree that this could be improved. Note however that you are calling getUpdateInterval() too early in bind() - at that moment not all AjaxLazyLoadPanel might exist yet.\r\nFurthermore I made sure that at least one request is fired, to keep the class backwards-compatible to 7.x with isContentReady() returning true by default.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/436569928/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/436604900","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/wicket/pull/298#issuecomment-436604900","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/298","id":436604900,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNjYwNDkwMA==","user":{"login":"Jezza","id":4224088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMjQwODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4224088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jezza","html_url":"https://github.com/Jezza","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jezza/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jezza/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jezza/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jezza/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jezza/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jezza/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jezza/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jezza/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jezza/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-07T12:17:52Z","updated_at":"2018-11-07T12:17:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Glad

mean, I can think of valid use case, but I'm not going to force it, because I definitely think we have a very specific edge case...\r\nWe have a generic lazy load supplier panel.\r\nIt accepts a supplier, and a factory that accepts a component id, and the supplier's result.\r\nThe reason the terminated is handy is because there's now a way to tell the panel itself that it didn't finish normally, but as I said, I'm not gonna force it, because I'm definitely in the minority.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout calling `getUpdateInterval` too soon, I'm assuming you mean from `onInitialise`.\r\nThat is a bit too soon, so I'm fine with moving it into the `onConfigure` where the `loaded` check is.\r\nThinking back, I can't remember why I did that...\r\nAh, wait, yeah, the check itself shouldn't be added in `onConfigure` due to how the request cycle works.\r\nIt'll fire it on anything...\r\n\r\nSide-note: This is actually how I noticed that the update interval wasn't taken into account on the first request.\r\nAll of these seemingly fast lazy load panels were taking a second to load.\r\nExactly one second.\r\n\r\nI think it's probably a good idea to remove the getUpdateInterval() call and rely on the behaviour itself to update itself.\r\nThat way the method isn't called too soon.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure I like keeping the behaviour of always firing a request.\r\nAn early escape makes sense, as in our case we have a cache that gets hit, which is why we load it in a LLP, as it's not there the first time.\r\nIt does a lot for user experience especially when the user is on a poor connection.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/436616860/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/437414969","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/wicket/pull/296#issuecomment-437414969","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/296","id":437414969,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNzQxNDk2OQ==","user":{"login":"bitstorm","id":536912,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjkxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536912?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitstorm","html_url":"https://github.com/bitstorm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitstorm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitstorm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitstorm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitstorm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitstorm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitstorm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitstorm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitstorm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitstorm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-09T16:30:37Z","updated_at":"2018-11-09T16:34:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Jezza
