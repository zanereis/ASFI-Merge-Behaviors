@mephi42 , did you think of a situation where the userDN cannot be composed by adding a prefix and a suffix to the username at all. So where authentication is handled with the userPrincipalName, but where the userDN is required for authorization. I haven't found a REALM implementation that resolves this issue.\r\nThe setup I'm handling is a AD one. \r\nFor making this more concrete: \r\nThe userPrincipalName format is johnthegreat@whatever.whatever.com\r\nwhile the distinguishedName format is CN=John The Great,CN=Users,DC=whatever,DC=whatever,DC=com\r\nThe username is seen as {firstName}{lastName} (without the spaces), while the group membership (used for authorization) is handled with the userDN.\r\n\r\nCurrently I created a custom implementation for supporting this LDAP; but I was wondering whether I am the only one facing this problem. Instead of working with an userDnTemplate, I worked with an authenticationTemplate and a user search base. Using those, I was able to retrieve the userDN.\r\nThis approach still supports providing the userDN template as authenticationTemplate (I supposed this to be the case when the userSearchBase is not provided).\r\n\r\nThis is the config file I'm currently using:\r\nldapRealm = com.company.ldap.realm.CustomLdapRealm\r\nldapRealm.authenticationTemplate = {0}@whatever.whatever.com\r\nldapRealm.userSearchBase = CN=Users,DC=whatever,DC=whatever,DC=com\r\nldapRealm.userSearchFilter = (sAMAccountName={0})\r\nldapRealm.groupSearchBase = OU=Groups,DC=whatever,DC=whatever,DC=com\r\nldapRealm.groupSearchFilter = (member={0})\r\nldapRealm.groupSearchFilterAttribute = distinguishedName\r\nldapRealm.groupRoleAttribute = cn\r\nldapRealm.contextFactory.url = ldap://whatever.whatever.com:389\r\nldapRealm.contextFactory.systemUsername = system-user\r\nldapRealm.contextFactory.systemPassword = system-password\r\n\r\nI have a local branch where I've implemented the changes in case you're willing to check them out.\r\n\r\nPlease be critic to what I've done, Your experience in this area might result in a better approach for handling this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/comments/378537207/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/comments/378597300","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shiro/pull/74#issuecomment-378597300","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/74","id":378597300,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3ODU5NzMwMA==","user":{"login":"bdemers","id":99954,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5OTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99954?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers","html_url":"https://github.com/bdemers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-04T13:21:08Z","updated_at":"2018-04-04T13:21:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@rubenvanwanzeele
