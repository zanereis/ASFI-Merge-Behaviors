continuous changes requests, it\r\n    just listens for database update events and does partial seq\r\n    btree folds.\r\n\r\n    COUCHDB-1288\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe clustered code for _changes does not

This is a break from CouchDB 1.x where the system Erlang was used; in 2.x releases include their own Erlang runtime and need no OS-level Erlang installed.\r\n\r\nWe do work around this limitation over in the `dev/run` script for development instances, but it requires a copious amount of `-pa` flags to the `erl` binary, see https://github.com/apache/couchdb/blob/master/dev/run#L420-L449 for the gory details.\r\n\r\nDue to max argument limitations esp. on Windows the cd makes things a lot easier at the very least; I don't know if absolute paths are strictly required.\r\n\r\nIf you want to experiment with this and put up a PR, we'll certainly consider it for inclusion.

all!\r\n\r\nSince version 1.6 elixir provides built-in code formatter which refers most of code style issues.\r\nThe goal of the formatter is to automate the styling of codebases into a unique and

formatted.\r\n`--check-equivalent` - checks if the files after formatting have the same AST as before formatting. If the ASTs are not equivalent, it is a bug in the code formatter.

I have theory why this might be happening. Would you be able to inspect your setup to confirm if you see the same pattern. I think this is at least _one_ possible bug in that code. And it would be consistent with the observation that it would have worked in 1.x but not in 2.x\r\n\r\nSo basically in your data directory pick a data base name and run this command:\r\n\r\n```\r\nls -l .shards/*/thedb*/mrview\r\n```\r\n\r\n(`thedb` if your database name in this case). And see if you get the same pattern, where most view shard  are not compacted but one is.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/442298918/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/442305096","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/1579#issuecomment-442305096","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1579","id":442305096,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MjMwNTA5Ng==","user":{"login":"regner","id":815037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNTAzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/815037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/regner","html_url":"https://github.com/regner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-28T03:21:27Z","updated_at":"2018-11-28T03:21:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"We just ran a compaction of all our databases with our stop-gap script so not sure if that will change the outcome of that query.\r\n\r\nAlso I should note that our config only has 1 shard.
