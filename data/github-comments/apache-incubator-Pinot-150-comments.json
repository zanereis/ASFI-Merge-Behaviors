That's because the StreamPartitionMsgOffset interface only tells us if we're caught up or we're behind, but it it doesn't tell us by how many events we are behind. That was the reason we couldn't define a threshold for catchup when offset based status checker was added.\r\n\r\nEven if we had this, I'm not sure it would help. I feel most folks set their SLAs based on time freshness, not \"number of events\". So even if we knew we were 10,000 events behind, that might be fine if you have 1,000 events per second but not fine if you have 10 events per seconds.\r\n\r\n> Anyways, the current PR has duplicate code between OffsetBasedStatusChecker and FreshnessBasedStatusChecker. I think by making a small change to the OffsetBasedStatusChecker, we can achieve the goal of this PR. We can pass in a config for freshness threshold to OffsetBasedStatusChecker and where we get the stream latest offset at startup, if the config is provided, we can get stream latest offset at the current moment and check the freshness then.\r\n\r\nFair feedback. I opted to use a parent class to keep the functionality separate rather than try to merge them. I feel like this is a better approach at the moment to keep things more easily testable and singularly responsible.\r\n\r\n> Good point. Can we enhance the stream interface to decide the lag and then emit a metric ?\r\n\r\nI'd really prefer not to make such a big change in this PR if it's not necessary.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1223418588/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1224276808","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/9261#issuecomment-1224276808","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/9261","id":1224276808,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5I-PtI","user":{"login":"jayeshchoudhary","id":41536903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNTM2OTAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41536903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayeshchoudhary","html_url":"https://github.com/jayeshchoudhary","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayeshchoudhary/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayeshchoudhary/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayeshchoudhary/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayeshchoudhary/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayeshchoudhary/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayeshchoudhary/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayeshchoudhary/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayeshchoudhary/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayeshchoudhary/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-23T16:01:08Z","updated_at":"2022-08-23T16:01:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"PR for updating docs -

I think by making a small change to the OffsetBasedStatusChecker, we can achieve the goal of this PR. We can pass in a config for freshness threshold to OffsetBasedStatusChecker and where we get the stream latest offset at startup, if the config is provided, we can get stream latest offset at the current moment and check the freshness then.\r\n> \r\n> Fair feedback.

For a topic with ~4,000 events/second, it takes us ~1-2 minutes per hour of ingestion lag to catch up when a server is restarted. Our segment seal threshold is 6 hours, so each restart takes ~3-6 minutes to reach the offset at startup. That brief period where we're then serving queries at 3-6 minutes behind is a bigger issue than the latency. Using freshness as the threshold happens to help with both. Even if we start serving queries at 15 seconds behind, that's relatively few remaining events to consume, so I don't expect query latency to be impacted any longer.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1224964658/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1224968273","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/9137#issuecomment-1224968273","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/9137","id":1224968273,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5JA4hR","user":{"login":"Jackie-Jiang","id":17555551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTU1NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17555551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang","html_url":"https://github.com/Jackie-Jiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-23T22:52:40Z","updated_at":"2022-08-23T22:52:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tanmesh Thanks for volunteering. We can focus on `SingleConnectionBrokerRequestHandler` for now. Currently broker gathers all the responses from all the servers before sending them to the reducer (See `SingleConnectionBrokerRequestHandler.processBrokerRequest()` line 113 `asyncQueryResponse.getFinalResponses()`). Instead, we want to reduce the results whenever a server responds, and early terminate the reduce (we may leverage the new introduced cancel query feature #9171).

For a topic with ~4,000 events/second, it takes us ~1-2 minutes per hour of ingestion lag to catch up when a server is restarted. Our segment seal threshold is 6 hours, so each restart takes ~3-6 minutes to reach the offset at startup. That brief period where we're then serving queries at 3-6 minutes behind is a bigger issue than the latency. Using freshness as the threshold happens to help with both. Even if we start serving queries at 15 seconds behind, that's relatively few remaining events to consume, so I don't expect query latency to be impacted any longer.\r\n\r\nMakes sense. Even in the case of a huge spike in the latest 15s, consumption rate limiter doesn't allow immediate consumption which in turns prevents latency in query execution.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1225016104/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1225020706","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/9251#issuecomment-1225020706","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/9251","id":1225020706,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5JBFUi","user":{"login":"apucher","id":25439965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NDM5OTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25439965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apucher","html_url":"https://github.com/apucher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apucher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apucher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apucher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apucher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apucher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apucher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apucher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apucher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apucher/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-24T00:25:15Z","updated_at":"2022-08-24T00:25:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"included in #9252 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1225020706/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1225042340","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/9265#issuecomment-1225042340","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/9265","id":1225042340,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5JBKmk","user":{"login":"61yao","id":111319704,"node_id":"U_kgDOBqKamA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/111319704?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/61yao","html_url":"https://github.com/61yao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/61yao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/61yao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/61yao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/61yao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/61yao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/61yao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/61yao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/61yao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/61yao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-24T00:57:42Z","updated_at":"2022-08-24T00:58:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> \r\n\r\nYeah.

To keep the existing behavior, should we put empty string as the group id if it is missing?\r\n\r\nI agree that the empty string will match the existing behavior. But it doesn't provide any value to the application. if you have more than one kafka table, they will all share the same group id, which in my opinion, is a bug or incorrect implementation. \r\nI think we can use the table name as the group id and prefix it with `stream-level` or `partition-level` based on the consumption model used. For existing applications that may rely on an empty string group id, they can always add a table config to override the `group.id` kafka consumer property. Wdyt @Jackie-Jiang ?

Changes that modify the underlying stream like topic name or cluster name change.\r\n2. Stream compatible changes that don't modify the underlying stream like segment.threshold parameters\r\n\r\nThe problem with first type is that offsets of different partitions change completely when the underlying stream changes. Pause/resume feature - that recently merged into master (#8986 and #9289) - can help here. For these incompatible parameter changes, the resume request has an option to handle the case of a completely new set of offsets. Operators can now follow a three-step process: First, issue a Pause request. Second, change the consumption parameters. Finally, issue the Resume request with the appropriate option. These steps will preserve the old data and allow the new data to be consumed immediately. All through the operation, queries will continue to be served.\r\n\r\nFor the 2nd type, force commit endpoint #9197 can be used. The current consuming segments which hold the previous values in stream config will be immediately completed and new consuming segment will be spun off. These new consuming segments will pick up the new values in the stream config.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1232284738/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1232288076","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/7039#issuecomment-1232288076","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/7039","id":1232288076,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5JczlM","user":{"login":"sajjad-moradi","id":8548220,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1NDgyMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8548220?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sajjad-moradi","html_url":"https://github.com/sajjad-moradi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sajjad-moradi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sajjad-moradi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sajjad-moradi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sajjad-moradi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sajjad-moradi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sajjad-moradi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sajjad-moradi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sajjad-moradi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sajjad-moradi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-30T23:54:29Z","updated_at":"2022-08-30T23:54:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Now
