There are only a few points where I may still be a little confused. For example, I prefer the hierarchical structure you mentioned, if this is not accept this time , I think commitlog_disk_access_mode may be better , As  direct io for log read when commitlog doing replay may finally be supported in the future , and different configuration for different disk access mode seems a bit redundant. As they seems are two big kind of configuration but hierarchical structure seem is only one .\r\n\r\nAs for correctness testing of DirectIOSegment, what about create a  log file ,and just write data , and using reader to fetch data and verify the correctness ?\r\nAlso I think we can add some stress test .\r\nLet me know if you if i can do something for this , I think this is a great feature for c* .\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/comments/1808328587/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/comments/1810156699","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/2777#issuecomment-1810156699","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/2777","id":1810156699,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmWM5r5Myb","user":{"login":"jacek-lewandowski","id":6516951,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MTY5NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6516951?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacek-lewandowski","html_url":"https://github.com/jacek-lewandowski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacek-lewandowski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacek-lewandowski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacek-lewandowski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacek-lewandowski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacek-lewandowski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacek-lewandowski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacek-lewandowski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacek-lewandowski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacek-lewandowski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-14T12:57:37Z","updated_at":"2023-11-14T12:58:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@amitdpawar @Maxwell-Guo I've created a separate PR to make it easier for reviewing\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/2894\r\n\r\nWhile implementing a unit test I realized we need more refactoring to make it a bit more testable.
