Do you agree with this?\r\n\r\nI can add then in another PR/update also the code you intend to use for the ASC case with the simple modifications.\r\n\r\nPutting this aside there is another issue with LIMIT x. The intended behavior of LIMIT is to limit the number of results considered at a point. The way it is translated by Calcite is similar with FETCH.

The clean-up is a best effort cleanup and will register another clean-up timer if there are records left in the state. So, we might not remove all expired records in one run but also do not have to iterate over all timestamps.

Yes, I am always on the newest master branch every time I write code. What you said about causes that issue reason,  it is did defined in ```org.apache.flink.table.utils._```. **But** the error is that ```UserDefinedFunctionTestUtils``` imports twice in the same scope. If we drop ```_``` and import specific class, we can get rid of this error. In ```import org.apache.flink.table.utils._``` package, there is a class called ```UserDefinedFunctionTestUtils``` and aslo in ```org.apache.flink.table.runtime.utils```,  there is an object called ```UserDefinedFunctionTestUtils```. So, that is directly leading to the compiler can not distinguish which one we want to choose. It is an **ambiguous** message to compiler.\r\n\r\nBTW, I dont down what the reaction to this on Linux or Mac. I can not afford a Mac, so I think i can found this error. Lol.\r\n\r\nYes.

You are right. I have decided that I have not build flink project for a long time. So, I guess that is the main reason leading to that issue. But in order to make sure it is correct. I will rebuild my flink project and run the test again. If there is no error i get. I will close this PR and the corresponing JIRA. But I will do a prediction, there isnt any error i will get ~ Waiting for this.\r\n\r\nThanks, Minglei","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/319685145/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/319685588","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4424#issuecomment-319685588","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4424","id":319685588,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxOTY4NTU4OA==","user":{"login":"rice668","id":6520673,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MjA2NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6520673?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668","html_url":"https://github.com/rice668","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-02T14:15:29Z","updated_at":"2017-08-02T14:15:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Because build flink always cost me a lot of time, So, I wasnt did this build flink stuff often.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/319685588/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/319693557","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4418#issuecomment-319693557","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4418","id":319693557,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxOTY5MzU1Nw==","user":{"login":"dianfu","id":5466492,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NjY0OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5466492?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu","html_url":"https://github.com/dianfu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-02T14:41:37Z","updated_at":"2017-08-02T14:41:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@dawidwys  Thanks a lot for your review.

But I am not sure whether we will adopt Ted's comments. So, that is why I leave this PR until someone adopt it, I will keep working on this then. As refers to what you said logging a different exception, hmm, probably. I would think it will give us more clear exception. @tedyu What do you think of this ?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/319841555/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/319843583","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4328#issuecomment-319843583","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4328","id":319843583,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxOTg0MzU4Mw==","user":{"login":"rice668","id":6520673,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MjA2NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6520673?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668","html_url":"https://github.com/rice668","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-03T01:36:22Z","updated_at":"2017-08-03T01:36:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks @tzulitai.

For the `StateBackendITCase`, it can be resolved by bumping the tycho compiler version to 1.0.0, but when I try to use tycho compiler version 1.0.0 in `flink-java`, it will cause lambda exception for `LambdaExtractionTest`. I think it's better to stay in the same version of tycho compiler in different flink project, so I try to modify the code of StateBackendITCase to resolve the problem directly.\r\n\r\n2. For the `JobRetrievalITCase`, I try every version of tycho compiler, the problem always exists. I think tycho compiler may be incompatible with `Seq.last()` method. I try to use another method in `Seq` to get the last element in `JobRetrievalITCase`, and it would be ok\r\n\r\n@zentol What do you think?
