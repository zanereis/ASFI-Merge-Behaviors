That is correct. \r\n\r\n> I see you are looking up the parent of the parent (grand parents) during merge instead of the immediate parents Is this intentional?\r\n\r\n> You are looking up both the parents and grand parents during split and updating their timestamp. Why grand parent too?\r\n\r\nI am looking up the grandparent only because the **grandparent id will be a part of the PK for the rows for the parent**. In your illustration, when ABCD splits, I want to know all its parents i.e. AB and CD. Then, we need to update the end time for all rows of ABCD i.e. (ABCD, AB) and (ABCD, CD). Hence when querying for the parent, I also include the grandparent in the query so that later on I can provide the complete PK to update the end time.  \r\n\r\n> For parents during split, why to lookup by start/end key, why not the same way as in merge? We are anyway not using the start/end key to constrain the rows to upsert for end time.\r\n\r\nThe merge coproc hook provides all parents and the daughter. The split coproc hook only provides the daughters, not the parents. So we will have to lookup by the start/end key.

AFAIK each call to System.nanosecond itself takes ~25- 30ns so for 2 calls you are adding double overhead. Now if the operation itself takes < 1 ms let us say 600ns you are adding a 10% measurement overhead.\r\n> \r\n> https://www.javaadvent.com/2019/12/measuring-time-from-java-to-kernel-and-back.html\r\n\r\nThanks, it was a great article. I got two key takeaways from the article:\r\n- Minimize the number of calls to measure time.\r\n- Measuring time in millis and nanos has roughly same overhead.\r\n\r\nI was of understanding that by measuring mutation plan creation and execution only, I am already minimizing amount of calls being made to track time. I have seen time taken by mutation plan creation and execution is of the order of 5-15 micro seconds (thus, using nano seconds clock). Should we just track time taken by a single `executeMutation` call and not track at further granularity? Though for executeMutation call we should track at nano seconds granularity.

I guess the point I was missing is that you are trying to do a point lookup to precisely target the rows to update by using the full PK.
