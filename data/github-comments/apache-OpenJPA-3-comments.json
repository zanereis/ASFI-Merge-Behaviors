overall idea is to not do the OSGi handling in \"main\" code but keep it located in OSGi package if possible (not a huge requirement but would be saner overall for the project).

Guess the test must have asserts otherwise the feature can be silently broken and test does not play its role IMHO (I understand it was failing before the test but still). Probably checking the auto assignment from the trigger was done after a flush is sufficient.\r\n2. we have 2 toggles (let say A and B), in the PR you do \"if A then !B\" but why not \"if B then !A\" so it looks a bit unfair to me. In other words, if the user explicitly set one of both, the other can be implied, if both are set then I guess both must be respected - potentially with a warning since I agree they overlap but user forced a config so we must respect it - and if none is set using an implicit fallback sounds better than current behavior. I don't recall if we can migrate from `boolean` to `Boolean` these two (with a potentially defaulting in the accessor) but it sounds like an option to solve this issue. Another one can be to use the setter maybe?\r\n\r\nHope it makes sense.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openjpa/issues/comments/948866243/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openjpa/issues/comments/949260287","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openjpa/pull/84#issuecomment-949260287","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openjpa/issues/84","id":949260287,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmHM44lI__","user":{"login":"solomax","id":3870591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NzA1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3870591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax","html_url":"https://github.com/solomax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-22T03:39:52Z","updated_at":"2021-10-22T03:39:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the review @rmannibucau \r\n\r\n1. should be improved :)\r\n2.

arrays not using iterators are faster in general).\r\n\r\nI modified the bench to add this test and here is my raw result:\r\n\r\n```\r\nBenchmark          Mode  Cnt  Score   Error  Units\r\nApp.testArray      avgt    2  0.022          ms/op\r\nApp.testArrayList  avgt    2  0.030          ms/op\r\nApp.testSet        avgt    2  0.022          ms/op\r\n```\r\n\r\n(which is close to what you had for the overlapping part except you have a better computer ;)).\r\n\r\nWhat is interesting is that the set is \"hot\" faster by design where the array string needs some cycles (JIT) - but not sure it is critical since normally the blacklist is small and whitelist open.\r\n\r\nWhat is sure is that `ArrayList` is a poor fit there - even if I'm not convinced that when it is used - serialization -

which would need to have stats about the ratio between primitives and custom classes, we can probably assume the primitives are numerous - if we include String as a primitive indeed - but I'm less convinced about arrays there. Keep in mind that even if we use a set for known types and add configuration to drop them from the default \"known\" set, we still need to iterate for other types so the speed of the set will be mitigated a bit and the small remaining distance with a plain array will be reduced so overall I think the compromise in terms of speed and code simplicity is not that bad with a plain array.\r\n\r\nWdyt?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openjpa/issues/comments/2289391258/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openjpa/issues/comments/2291369384","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openjpa/pull/118#issuecomment-2291369384","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openjpa/issues/118","id":2291369384,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmHM6Ik4Wo","user":{"login":"solomax","id":3870591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NzA1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3870591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax","html_url":"https://github.com/solomax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-15T14:24:03Z","updated_at":"2024-08-15T14:24:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rmannibucau
