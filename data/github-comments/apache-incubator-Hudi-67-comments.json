Looks like the same ordering field will be honored in all places.

This feature is automatically enabled for newly created Hudi tables. For existing tables, this feature is turned off by default. Please read this section, before enabling this feature for existing hudi tables. To enable the new hudi timeline layout which avoids renames, use the write config “hoodie.timeline.layout.version=1”. Alternatively, you can use “repair overwrite-hoodie-props” to append the line “hoodie.timeline.layout.version=1” to hoodie.properties. Note that in any case, upgrade hudi readers (query engines) first with 0.5.1-incubating release before upgrading writer.\r\n```\r\n\r\nthis is what seems relevant to me..

Strange, i would say, because we can write `null` values (as you can see later on).\r\n\r\nSo i tried another approach:\r\nWy pass a `JsonProperties.NULL_VALUE` to avro when i could not handle it? This would also fix the patched avro 1.8.2 problem, so we dont need a patched avro that kind of supports `JsonProperties.NULL_VALUE.`\r\nThe new approach is to pass `null` instead of `JsonProperties.NULL_VALUE` to avro when the default value is `JsonProperties.NULL_VALUE`.
