IIRC, they came after JSPWiki was i18ned so that's why they're not used everywhere, as why should (note that we only use MessageFormat when the message has arguments).\r\n\r\nAs for the PR itself, running [TranslationCheck](https://jspwiki-wiki.apache.org/Wiki.jsp?page=HowToI18n) for `it` yields the following missing untranslated strings:\r\n\r\n```\r\nChecking /CoreResources_it.properties...\r\n\r\nMissing:\r\n--------\r\ncomment.changenote = Comment added on {0} by {1}\r\nrss.title.full = Aggregated RSS feed of the entire wiki\r\nsecurity.error.email.taken = The email ''{0}'' is already taken, you can use an email for only one profile.\r\n\r\n\r\nChecking /plugin/PluginResources_it.properties...\r\n\r\nMissing:\r\n--------\r\ninsertpage.more = More...\r\nweblogentryplugin.addcomment = <span class=\"icon-plus\"></span> Add new comment ({0})\r\nweblogentryplugin.more = (more)\r\nweblogentryplugin.permalink = Permalink\r\nweblogentryplugin.postedby = Posted by {0}&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\nChecking /templates/default_it.properties...\r\n\r\nMissing:\r\n--------\r\nactions.confirmlogout = Please confirm that you want to logout!\r\nactions.groups = Groups\r\nactions.registernow = Register a new user!\r\nactions.showreaderview = Show Reader View\r\nactions.trail = Trail\r\nattach.add.drop = or drop them here\r\nattach.add.select = Select files or drop them here\r\nattach.moreinfo = Info\r\nblog.permalink = Permalink\r\ndiff.tab = Version management\r\neditgroup.cancel.submit = Cancel\r\neditor.plain.autosuggest = Auto Suggest\r\neditor.plain.comment = Leave a comment\r\neditor.plain.comment.resize = Drag to resize the main page area\r\neditor.plain.create = Add your page content here\r\neditor.plain.edit.resize = Drag to resize the text and preview area\r\neditor.plain.livepreview = Live Preview\r\neditor.plain.localstorage.delete = Delete\r\neditor.plain.localstorage.restore = Restore this unsaved version!\r\neditor.plain.save.submit.comment = Post Comment\r\neditor.plain.sidebysidepreview = Side by Side Preview\r\neditor.plain.tbCHARS.title = Special characters\r\neditor.plain.tbFONT.title = Font\r\ngroup.actions = Actions\r\ngroup.created = Created on\r\ngroup.modified = Date Modified\r\ngroup.thecreator = Created by\r\ngroup.themodifier = Modified by\r\ninfo.uploadnew.candraganddrop = or drop them here!\r\njavascript.broken.image = Content unavailable!

that way we could have another language fully translated into JSPWiki O:-) If not, please do tell us so we proceed with merging this corrections, which are also appreciated anyway :-)\r\n\r\nthx,\r\njuan pablo","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jspwiki/issues/comments/1060634181/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jspwiki/issues/comments/1060703999","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jspwiki/pull/167#issuecomment-1060703999","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jspwiki/issues/167","id":1060703999,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAJ07c4_OQ7_","user":{"login":"juanpablo-santos","id":1218530,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTg1MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1218530?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanpablo-santos","html_url":"https://github.com/juanpablo-santos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanpablo-santos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanpablo-santos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanpablo-santos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanpablo-santos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanpablo-santos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanpablo-santos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanpablo-santos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanpablo-santos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanpablo-santos/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-07T13:45:28Z","updated_at":"2022-03-07T13:45:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Update took place on 2.11.2-git-04","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jspwiki/issues/comments/1060703999/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jspwiki/issues/comments/1060704037","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jspwiki/pull/167#issuecomment-1060704037","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jspwiki/issues/167","id":1060704037,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAJ07c4_OQ8l","user":{"login":"dependabot[bot]","id":49699333,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDk2OTkzMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/29110?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/dependabot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-07T13:45:31Z","updated_at":"2022-03-07T13:45:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"OK, I won't notify you again about this release, but will get in touch when a new version is available.

@JLLeitschuh,\r\n\r\nspeaking for myself, **not** on behalf of the project, while most of the time I welcome any PR, I have to say that I find this kind of PRs disrespectful and irresponsible. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate your security concerns, but I sincerely think this is not the way.\r\n\r\nSending bulk e-mails is very similar to how spam works. Furthermore, proposed code fix has been detected mass scaning OSS projects, without a check that indeed there is a vulnerability (details on this at the end of this comment). As a security researcher/whatever you are expected to do at least that. Every other vulnerability report that we have received has done that, so sending a security report without checking is somewhat disrepectful to other security researchers. How the vulnerability can be exploited is also a nice to have, so the people receiving your reports are able to fix the issue as fast as possible, but since you have gone the public way I suppose it is fine as it is.\r\n\r\nYou say that you know/hope/think that there is a vulnerability, so you choose to disclose publicly because you don't have time to go to every project and check how do they manage these kind of issues. Please respect everybody else's time, which will probably be as scarce and valuable as yours, and play nice. Think of it as if part of your security research involves time on those tasks. Same for verifying whatever the tooling you use has found. Yes, you would probably not reach as many projects, but that's just a matter of quality over quantity. Also, since you are targetting GitHub projects, here's a hint: most of them contain a Security tab at the top of each repo with further instructions. For ASF projects, you can directly follow up with [these instructions](https://apache.org/security/); since there are more than 200 ASF projects, plus the incubating ones, surely that's worth automating.\r\n\r\nReally, full public disclosure does not help anyone: best case scenario, there isn't really a security vulnerability, and some mantainer will have to write back to someone who thinks that mass e-mailing projects is fine, after wasting his/her time looking if the report is really valid. Worst case scenario, let's say you find the next log4shell issue; I fail to see how it would be a good idea to publicly disclose that. Seriously. Don't blame lack of GH infrastructure and just be responsible. Doing otherwise is not cool.\r\n\r\nAs for the proposed one line fix, there's a comparison between a path's file and a directory whose path can't be reached or managed by an end-user, so I can't see how the reported vulnerability could be exploited, nor the need to security-harden it. Would be nice if you could follow up with this, most preferably following [these guidelines](https://github.com/apache/jspwiki/security/policy).\r\n\r\nbest

That was not my intention. Please forgive me.\n\n> Sending bulk e-mails is very similar to how spam works.\n\n> For ASF projects, you can directly follow up with these instructions; since there are more than 200 ASF projects, plus the incubating ones, surely that's worth automating.\n\nI'm struggling to understand what you're asking for here with these two comments. They seem to contradict eachother.\n\n> Please respect everybody else's time, which will probably be as scarce and valuable as yours, and play nice. Think of it as if part of your security research involves time on those tasks.\n\nI fully recognize that Open Source is \"free as in free puppy\". I've been an open source developer for many years. I believe that users of open source can't have any expectations of open source maintainers (the software is freely made available without a contract), but unfortunately that also means that there can be no expectations around anyone in the OSS community, including security researchers.\n\n> Every other vulnerability report that we have received has done that, so sending a security report without checking is somewhat disrepectful to other security researchers.\n\nAFAIK, no other security researcher has attempted to disclose and fix vulnerabilities at this scale before. I'm forging a new path, and I fully admit I may have gotten it wrong in places, but I am taking feedback like yours into consideration. I'm sorry that this upset you so much.\n\nIf you'd like to setup some time to discuss your feelings and potential solutions in more detail, feel free to grab a slot on my calendar. I'm more than happy to chat.\n\nhttps://calendly.com/d/g5x-jtk-653/one-off-meeting\n\n\n\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jspwiki/issues/comments/1272316873/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jspwiki/issues/comments/1272764177","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jspwiki/pull/230#issuecomment-1272764177","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jspwiki/issues/230","id":1272764177,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAJ07c5L3NcR","user":{"login":"dependabot[bot]","id":49699333,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDk2OTkzMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/29110?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/dependabot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-10T04:14:04Z","updated_at":"2022-10-10T04:14:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Superseded by #233.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jspwiki/issues/comments/1272764177/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jspwiki/issues/comments/1284533514","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jspwiki/pull/219#issuecomment-1284533514","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jspwiki/issues/219","id":1284533514,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAJ07c5MkG0K","user":{"login":"dependabot[bot]","id":49699333,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDk2OTkzMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/29110?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/dependabot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-19T20:25:57Z","updated_at":"2022-10-19T20:25:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"OK, I won't notify you again about this release, but will get in touch when a new version is available.
