It would probably be fine to do best-effort retrying when using that setup, but it seems like kind of an odd case to support. The retry code needs to be changed to support that case as well, since doSeekRetriableTopicPartitions doesn't work at all when auto-commit is enabled, because it depends on acked, so I'm not really sure it's worth it.\r\n\r\nRegarding the patch and my previous comment, I still think moving this check into fail() and just disabling retries if auto commit is enabled is a better option (i.e. if auto-commit is on, the only thing fail() needs to do is remove the message from emitted and nothing else). It has the same effect as this patch, but we can ensure that it only has effect if auto-commit is enabled. The patch as is could end up hiding bugs, since doSeekRetriableTopicPartitions now quietly skips topicpartitions where acked is null. It's also easier to tell from reading the code why failing tuples would be disabled when auto-commit is on, than it is to tell why there's a null check in doSeekRetriableTopicPartitions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/264951391/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/265082801","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1807#issuecomment-265082801","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1807","id":265082801,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NTA4MjgwMQ==","user":{"login":"cutd","id":17472204,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDcyMjA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17472204?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cutd","html_url":"https://github.com/cutd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cutd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cutd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cutd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cutd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cutd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cutd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cutd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cutd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cutd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-06T07:45:32Z","updated_at":"2016-12-06T07:45:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@srdo I think you are right!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/265082801/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612951879","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/5859#issuecomment-2612951879","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/5859","id":2612951879,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI5NTE4Nzk=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-06T10:53:33Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T16:40:35Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=liurenjie1024\">liurenjie1024</a>:</i>\n<p>I think the patch is incorrect since the consumer has already seeked to the correct position in the ConsumerRebalanceListener.

This should cause the async loop (https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/storm-core/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/utils/Utils.java#L2177) to stop running, since an InterruptedException will be thrown from either within the spout, or from the sleep statement in the loop. The loop catches and handles InterruptedException so we don't crash the worker while shutting down. The Kafka consumer doesn't throw InterruptedException when interrupted, but instead a Kafka specific unchecked InterruptException. If we don't catch and convert it to something Storm understands, the spout will cause the worker to crash when shutting down. This is very inconvenient for local mode clusters, since that means the VM running the cluster gets killed. The ways to convert the exception are either to throw a new (wrapped) InterruptedException out of the spout, or to reinterrupt the running thread.\r\n\r\nI can replace the interrupt with `throw new RuntimeException(new InterruptedException())` if you like?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/266348220/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612971332","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/6018#issuecomment-2612971332","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/6018","id":2612971332,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI5NzEzMzI=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-12T07:07:44Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T16:50:20Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=liurenjie1024\">liurenjie1024</a>:</i>\n<p>Hi, Hugo, Are you working on this?

I think that the code as is will simply throw a RuntimeException and shutdown the JVM. \r\n\r\nWe don't really do this type of check elsewhere in the codebase, and in particular in the old spout. My opinion is that we don't need this check which will make the code a bit more complex to little gain.
