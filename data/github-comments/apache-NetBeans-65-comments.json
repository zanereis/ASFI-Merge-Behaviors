While it would be awesome to have an entry in \"resolved\", I am not sure it is strictly necessary. In fact, I believe we are already doing something similar - the Windows launchers link against the standard libraries, which are (AFAIK) GPLv3 with an exception. (I don't want to pretend I can quantify how similar the exception are or are not.) And I believe the recommendation back then was to mark the whole launcher as ALv2, and this is what was done.\r\n\r\nHow to translate all this to NetBeans IDE as a whole modular application written in Java is (I think) the question now. And I do not have firm answers, but I assume this PR was meant to discuss aspects the PMC can discuss. OTOH, feel free to take it to the mailing list.\r\n\r\nThe specific hint about PMC was:\r\n\r\n> The source of their work would still only be under GPL+CE and\r\nwould have to be entirely separate from our products. How you would\r\nmake sure of that is a PMC discussion.\r\n\r\nWe can discuss that as well, but especially in case of JavaFX, I am not sure how the sources for JavaFX and NetBeans could be seen to not be entirely separate.\r\n\r\nWhat I like here is the use of the \"nb\" cluster. Unlike all other clusters, this one creates the application, that is Apache NetBeans IDE, and hence could be described as defining the \"executable\" (and it also physically includes the actual launcher/executable file). If that's a sufficient - not sure, but hope so.
