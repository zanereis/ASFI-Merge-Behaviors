Thank you for contribution @tien!\r\n> \r\n> Did I understand correctly that users will be able to use it without having to change the code? Is there any breaking changes?\r\n\r\nOnly one possible breaking change:\r\n\r\nFor most user who use modern ES module import, this will work just fine:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport gremlin from \"gremlin\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut for those that still use Common JS instead of the standard ES Module. Then the import will be a bit weird:\r\n \r\n```ts\r\nconst a = require(\"someModule\");\r\n// Since module use async I/O\r\nconst gremlin = await import(\"gremlin\").default;\r\n```\r\n \r\nSince master is targeting the next major release, I reckon just we can output ES module only? Most packages nowadays do this, since usage of Common JS is discouraged, because it's no longer standard & it could actually affect your application performance, example: https://web.dev/articles/commonjs-larger-bundles\r\n \r\nBut if not, I can make a change to output both Common JS & ES module.\r\n \r\nEDIT: but as I'm saying this, I realised there's no cost to supporting both, it's just one extra config file. So have done so anyway.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1992375619/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1992488713","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/2515#issuecomment-1992488713","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/2515","id":1992488713,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc52wvcJ","user":{"login":"vkagamlyk","id":7605999,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDU5OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7605999?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkagamlyk","html_url":"https://github.com/vkagamlyk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkagamlyk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkagamlyk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkagamlyk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkagamlyk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkagamlyk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkagamlyk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkagamlyk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkagamlyk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkagamlyk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-12T20:07:21Z","updated_at":"2024-03-12T20:07:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Missing parts:\r\n- documentation update for [users](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/reference/#gremlin-javascript), [developers environment](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/dev/developer/#nodejs-environment) and [release process](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/dev/developer/#_release_process).

@saivivek116, thanks for the submission. Could you give a quick description of the changes? Was the test flaky simply due to the unpredictable ordering of HashSet elements? What does the new workflow do? I'm not familiar with Non-Dex.\r\n\r\nIf this is just a case of a HashSet being used in a test should use a LinkedHashSet, I think that the coverage from https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/master/.github/workflows/build-test.yml is enough.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1998628668/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1998732047","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/2524#issuecomment-1998732047","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/2524","id":1998732047,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc53IjsP","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-15T01:22:26Z","updated_at":"2024-03-25T20:59:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## [Codecov](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/tinkerpop/pull/2524?dropdown=coverage&src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=apache) Report\nAttention: Patch coverage is `93.75000%` with `1 lines` in your changes are missing coverage.

(I did write a test case when I implemented this. I only deleted it before committing to not impact other tests.)\r\n\r\nStephens assumption was:\r\n\r\n> It works because it probably piggybacks on property(object?, object?, objects[]?) which has all nullable arguments.\r\n\r\nTurns out that this is not the case. The `DotNetTranslator` produces a C# traversal with individual `Property` steps for each map entry: https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/e3ced38b2108f3edb29f11fbfa4f6950427bcbd9/gremlin-dotnet/test/Gremlin.Net.IntegrationTest/Gherkin/Gremlin.cs#L539\r\n\r\nSo, as a next attempt I wanted to change the translator to instead produce a C# traversal using the new `Dictionary` overload.\r\nBut then I learned that that's now even possible since Gremlin-Java already produces Bytecode without this overload:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/e3ced38b2108f3edb29f11fbfa4f6950427bcbd9/gremlin-core/src/main/java/org/apache/tinkerpop/gremlin/process/traversal/dsl/graph/GraphTraversal.java#L3221-L3234\r\n\r\nand the translator only gets the Bytecode produced from the traversal.\r\n\r\nSo I don't see any elegant way to test this using Gherkin tests without changing the Gremlin-Java overload (which is a bigger change than what makes sense here in my opinion). We could add a hard-coded translation for one feature test to ensure that the traversal in C# will use the new overload, but I don't really like maintaining such hard-coded translations.\r\n\r\nHowever, this got me to the idea to instead use the translation from C# to Groovy for a test. I just pushed an updated commit with such a test. The test does not compile without the added overload and the translation also includes the successful construction of Bytecode from the traversal as the translator also uses the Bytecode.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/2079581200/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/2079624005","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/2565#issuecomment-2079624005","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/2565","id":2079624005,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc579ItF","user":{"login":"vkagamlyk","id":7605999,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDU5OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7605999?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkagamlyk","html_url":"https://github.com/vkagamlyk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkagamlyk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkagamlyk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkagamlyk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkagamlyk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkagamlyk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkagamlyk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkagamlyk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkagamlyk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkagamlyk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-26T15:32:29Z","updated_at":"2024-04-26T15:32:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"VOTE
