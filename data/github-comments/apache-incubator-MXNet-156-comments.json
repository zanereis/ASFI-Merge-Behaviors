I tried to follow the example [here](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/master/R-package/vignettes/CallbackFunctionTutorial.Rmd), but doing so runs into the problem identified above (the output of a network with a custom loss, is the loss itself, not a predicted value).\r\n\r\nI have two questions:\r\n1) Has anyone got an example of a use of `MakeLoss` which also does logging of the train/validation error during training?\r\n\r\n2) Does anyone have an example of using a `mx.io.DataIter` in R?

It means it that manages memory, computation for you\r\n    - Eventually you will see that evolves into a deep learning library of its own\r\n    - It means huge effort for each vendor to implement all the scheduling and optimizations that could be shared across hardwares(via using a standard deep learning framework), this might benefit big vendors who have more resources, and provide higher chance of lock in, but was bad for vendors who cannot catch up.\r\n    - It also means we might loose possibility for imperative execution(if execution have to rely on a graph)\r\n\r\nPersonally, I think what we really need is separation of these things(Tensor data structure, the computation, memory management, scheduling), adopt unix philosophy, do one module more transparently and interact with others, specifically:\r\n- The memory layout of tensor should be transparent, with some indication of variants and layout when necessary in the operation implementations. \r\n- Allow the user to pass in the memory, and workspace instead of relying on internal allocator\r\n- Make computation as stateless as possible.\r\n- Allow easy hookup to existing kernels, layers\r\n    -

yes both are in the roadmap.. we can already cover this with upstream [CLCUDAPI header](https://github.com/CNugteren/CLCudaAPI/blob/master/doc/api.md) using a start and end interator of a c++ container and we have distinct BufferHost and Buffer concepts.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/277178767/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/277185695","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/4865#issuecomment-277185695","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/4865","id":277185695,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NzE4NTY5NQ==","user":{"login":"catalystfrank","id":5650433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTA0MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5650433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/catalystfrank","html_url":"https://github.com/catalystfrank","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catalystfrank/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catalystfrank/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catalystfrank/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catalystfrank/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catalystfrank/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catalystfrank/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catalystfrank/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catalystfrank/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catalystfrank/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-03T07:53:20Z","updated_at":"2017-02-03T07:53:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It

this happens even for the most simple operator (see the example below).\r\n\r\nWhen I look at the code, I think one would simply have to move the InferType implementation in src/operator/operator_util.cc to the default case in include/mxnet/operator.h. The default case checks that all dtypes are float32, and the (more sensible) code in src/operator/operator_util.cc checks whether all dtypes are the same.\r\nI could submit a fix, but I am simply not
