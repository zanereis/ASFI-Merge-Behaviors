question is`IntelliJ` only imports `static all other import`.\r\n\r\nI've been a little busy recently, so I didn't update latest discussion  in the issue content.\r\nwhat I expect support static import sort. (Please ignore the content of `import with '*'`, I used the screenshot from the past.)\r\n![](https://s2.loli.net/2022/04/12/bwsKRJxYTAlEHIS.png)\r\n\r\nMaybe I need to make an issue for
