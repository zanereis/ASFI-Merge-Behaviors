Thanks for your positive feedback. IIUC, this improvement is effective for both Flink/Spark Streaming jobs when build `FileSystemView`. And the time saved is also considerable as @ThinkerLei mentioned above. Of course, it involve some additional memory cost. I totally agree gatekeeper's concerned especially about Flink engine, the restart cost will not be accepted when OOM. Actually in our prod cluster, we did not observe some extra OOM due to this change. \r\nAnyway, I think this is one choice for performance improvement.
