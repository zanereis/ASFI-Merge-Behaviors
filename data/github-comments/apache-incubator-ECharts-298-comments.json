Here I'd like to give some feedback for this new feature, please feel free to check and evaluate it.\r\nNormally, if the value of bar doesn't change, the value of its label should not change and if changed, it should count from its previous newest value, but in fact, the value of bar label will always count from 0 when updating, just like the screenshot below:\r\n\r\n![unexpected](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26999792/86570584-bb86c400-bfa2-11ea-89ac-390ffd97b4f6.gif)\r\n\r\nWhat I think it's expected is like this:\r\n\r\n![expected](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26999792/86570612-c5a8c280-bfa2-11ea-8373-c198629a9814.gif)\r\n\r\nThat is,\r\n1). The label of bar has no need to recount from 0 if its value has no change.\r\n2). If its value changed, it should recount from its previous value, like the screenshot above.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think of these?\r\n\r\nEDITED: I saw it looks like working well in the screenshot you provided in PR description.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/654088597/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/654093292","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/12916#issuecomment-654093292","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/12916","id":654093292,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1NDA5MzI5Mg==","user":{"login":"plainheart","id":26999792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTk5Nzky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26999792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/plainheart","html_url":"https://github.com/plainheart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plainheart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plainheart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plainheart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plainheart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plainheart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plainheart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plainheart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plainheart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plainheart/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-06T08:28:57Z","updated_at":"2020-07-06T08:28:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I think there may be missing some detailed information.\r\n1) What does your source code like?\r\n2) Are there some grammar or usage errors in your source code?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/654093292/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
