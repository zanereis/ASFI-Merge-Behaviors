The only think which could be good to get rid of is the requirement that you have to select a Euclidean distance for the quadtree. Maybe there is some other characteristic for a distance measure which says whether it's applicable for quadtrees or not. Then we could introduce a new distance metric type to make sure that only appropriate distance measures are used.

we weren't convinced that the performance of the implementation used is efficient enough for our use-cases\n  - removed Reservoir/Snapshot and various wrapper classes\n- moved ScheduledDropWizardReporter into a new flink-metrics-dropwizard module within flink-metrics\n  - removes Dropwizard usage entirely from flink-core\n- the MetricRegistry no longer maintains maps of all metrics; reporters are from now on responsible for doing this\n  - Listener interface was removed\n  - AbstractReporter class was added that implements this behaviour\n  - will make it easier to support multiple reporters in the future\n- Counter and Gauge no longer implement the DropWizard interface\n  - added Counter-/GaugeWrapper classes for DropWizard reporters\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/220087815/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/220087832","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2003#issuecomment-220087832","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2003","id":220087832,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMDA4NzgzMg==","user":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-18T16:46:11Z","updated_at":"2016-05-18T16:46:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Couldn't find the problem.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/220087832/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/220088196","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1980#issuecomment-220088196","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1980","id":220088196,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMDA4ODE5Ng==","user":{"login":"greghogan","id":569655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2OTY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/569655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan","html_url":"https://github.com/greghogan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-18T16:47:35Z","updated_at":"2016-05-18T16:47:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Tests are passing ... will merge ...\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/220088196/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/220090860","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2000#issuecomment-220090860","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2000","id":220090860,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMDA5MDg2MA==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-18T16:57:12Z","updated_at":"2016-05-18T16:57:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Fix looks good to me.

for the update @gallenvara and @greghogan for the review.\nI have left a few comments in places where I couldn't figure out the code logic.\n\nThere is one more thing I'd like to discuss with you. The current implementation is using `EdgeDirection.ALL`, but this feature is not very efficiently implemented. It actually performs 2 coGroups (one on the source Id and one on the target Id) and unions the outputs to create the result of the messaging function. Instead, I was thinking we could do the following: mark the inputs graph edges with an \"authority\" label and add opposite-direction edges with a \"hub\" label. Then, we can use the default edge direction (IN) to perform the iteration. In even supersteps, each vertex sends messages only along \"authority\" edges and in odd supersteps only along \"hub\" edges. Does this make sense?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/220134968/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/220143133","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1956#issuecomment-220143133","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1956","id":220143133,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMDE0MzEzMw==","user":{"login":"greghogan","id":569655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2OTY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/569655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan","html_url":"https://github.com/greghogan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-18T20:09:49Z","updated_at":"2016-05-18T20:09:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@vasia that is a very good idea.

like the addition. Two things, however, that I am not sure about:\n1. The `Histogram` uses a `LongHistogram` internally, which results in a lot of wrapping and converting. Each accumulator report (each heartbeat) needs to do the conversion. I think the Histogram should rather hold the proper (int, int) map directly.\n2. I am skeptical about failing hard in the Histogram on an integer overflow. These kind of hard failures in utility types are always tricky. A program causing an overflow will result in a non-recoverable failure (it will always overflow again). For streaming programs, that is not a nice property. I would actually rather try to deprecate the int histogram (let it overflow) and encourage to replace it over time completely with the long histogram.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/220275206/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/220275432","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1966#issuecomment-220275432","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1966","id":220275432,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMDI3NTQzMg==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-19T09:37:22Z","updated_at":"2016-05-19T09:37:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Please let me know what you think about these suggestions!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/220275432/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/220276542","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2003#issuecomment-220276542","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2003","id":220276542,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMDI3NjU0Mg==","user":{"login":"mxm","id":837221,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNzIyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/837221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm","html_url":"https://github.com/mxm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-19T09:42:25Z","updated_at":"2016-05-19T09:42:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I just replaced Failsafe with Surefire.
