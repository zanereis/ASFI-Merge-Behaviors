Thanks for the review! What I was referring to with the 3 letter change was in the test class itself not the core code. For example, I thought  about changing the 'ssl' value in [TestConsumeMqttSSL](https://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/7923fd04c35737df8145b213536bdf333ef72713/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-mqtt-bundle/nifi-mqtt-processors/src/test/java/org/apache/nifi/processors/mqtt/integration/TestConsumeMqttSSL.java#L74) assuming that we would want to run all the same tests for wss as to ssl (and similarly for ws as for tcp). Subclassing common/Test*MqttCommon as you suggest won't remove this issue as I would essentially be reimplementing all the tests and setup from TestConsumeMqttSSL. However I could subclass TestConsumeMqttSSL -> TestConsumeMqttWss (for example) and pull the assigning of the broker out into a method and just overwrite that in the subclass.\r\n\r\nFor the changes to MqttTestClient.java, they were autogenerated using Intellij. I believe this is due to changes in the IMqttClient  interface referenced in the newer version of the Paho dependancy (1.1.1 from 1.0.2). Is it good practice to leave these as are? It does feel unnecessary to have all the comments there given they are only implemented to make a stub (or mock? I'm never sure exactly which is which)\r\n\r\nI'm still trying to get the -Pcontrib-check flag to work. I originally ticked that box in the PR erroneously.\r\n\r\nHope this helps with the review and thanks again!\r\nSeb","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/330636268/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/331141553","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2166#issuecomment-331141553","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2166","id":331141553,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMTE0MTU1Mw==","user":{"login":"yjhyjhyjh0","id":4414486,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTQ0ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4414486?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yjhyjhyjh0","html_url":"https://github.com/yjhyjhyjh0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yjhyjhyjh0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yjhyjhyjh0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yjhyjhyjh0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yjhyjhyjh0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yjhyjhyjh0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yjhyjhyjh0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yjhyjhyjh0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yjhyjhyjh0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yjhyjhyjh0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-21T12:28:42Z","updated_at":"2017-09-21T12:28:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've

It appears that prior to this PR it also overriding (2.6.1 vs 2.5.4). Because the use of jackson is so widespread and the behavior of dependency management with regards to transitive dependencies, I'm wondering if it makes to remove `jackson-annotations` and allow individual modules to pull it in using the `jackson.version` property introduced here.

So that is great.\r\n\r\nI found Jasypt L&N entries in the following\r\n\r\n- nifi-assembly/NOTICE  This should be removed.  I realize you still have it for test but our assembly notice wont need it for test cases since we're not bundling those binary deps in that case.\r\n-nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-framework-nar/NOTICE  Can be removed from here now too\r\n\r\nIf you can please rebase to resolve the conflict, address the test failures for environments like mine which do not have unlimited JCE installed, and fix these L&N i think we're in good shape.\r\n\r\nThanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/331500385/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/331511003","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2123#issuecomment-331511003","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2123","id":331511003,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMTUxMTAwMw==","user":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-22T17:31:21Z","updated_at":"2017-09-22T17:31:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I took the liberty of changing the Lookup Key property to Lookup Value Field, and updated variables and unit tests and such. +1 LGTM, built and ran unit tests, also tried a flow with LookupRecord with various settings (Lookup Value Field set and not set, Insert Entire Record and Insert Record Fields, etc.).
