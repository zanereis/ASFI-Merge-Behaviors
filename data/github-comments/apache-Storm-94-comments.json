memory leak.<br/>\n    But there is also reference for the closed Client in cached-node+port->socket in worker, for this reason we should also remove closed Client from cached-node+port->socket.<br/>\n    Meanwhile there is another reason for us to do so. Think about this situation: worker A connect to worker B1 B2, but for some reason worker B1 B2 died at the same, then nimbus reschedule worker B1 B1. And new B1 B2 may partly rescheduled at the some host:port as old B1 B2, that is (old B1: host1+port1, old B2: host2+port2, new B1: host2+port2, new B2: host3+port3). Worker A realized worker B1 B2 died and start reconnect to worker B1 B2, but before new worker B1 and old B2 have the same host+port, and by the current logic, we will remove old B1 Client and and create new Client for new worker B2, and do nothing to old B2 and new B1 because they have the same host+port. This will result the topology stop processing tuples. Once we remove closed Client from cached-node+port->socket before refresh-connections, this will not happen again.</p>\n\n<p>You can merge this pull request into a Git repository by

We have a Hack Week coming up, and there are several folks interested. Having read the proposals, as well as the Dynamic Storm paper, I believe my current ideas line up a bit closer to the original proposal.</p>\n\n<p>I will attempt to tackle it from what I'm going to call a \"Balanced Storm Topology\" (don't know if there is another name): This is where the parallelism will be auto-scaled to a multiple of the number of auto-scaled workers, and each worker has the same number and type of bolts and spouts. I have observed that the FAQs indicate this is a good thing, and Nimbus seems to gravitate to this configuration if the parallelism is right. I believe this will be the most stable layout of the topology,  short of one instance per worker, and one worker per host/container (sounds like a description for Heron).</p>\n\n<p>My plan is to use latency*events/sec normalized to 0-100% as the primary metric for determine these values.</p>\n\n<p>One of the goals will be to limit the number of iterations as rebalancing a Storm topology is not without its costs. Another feature of our use cases is that there are daily and weekly fluctuations in our load, but the max is somewhat stable (it grows slowly over time). And since we need to be guaranteed to have enough hardware to handle our peak loads, the sizing parameters and scaling algorithms will reflect this scenario. Generally we know the max input rate (or predicted input rate) at the spouts, the system will be sized to that at a minimum, and there won't be any scale-down below this limit.</p>\n\n<p>Because of this I'd like to consider is the \"replay on startup\" issue, where if Storm is down for a bit, and you have messages queued up, that on startup, you system will typically burst to 100% till the backlog is drained. I wish to put some controls in place to handle this, as I don't think the system should try to scale up briefly, and then scale down. This will be a bit more difficult, as I believe that I need to know from each spout if it is playing a backlog, or current time, as well as the backlog size, and the rate at which it is changing. Sounds like perhaps a new interface that auto-scaling spouts might support?</p>\n\n<p>Then as inputs:<br/>\n*) user can elect certain headroom on the latency*events number (or we may have good defaults)<br/>\n*) planned number of events for each spout, as the current load may be less, or may have daily variations, or you may want to plan ahead for holiday time or some such.<br/>\n*) estimated maximum down time and desired backlog catch-up time.</p>\n\n<p>And given time, various events will need to come out of Nimbus to external systems to add more hardware, as well as various alarms/notifications.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612515844/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/123132069","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/642#issuecomment-123132069","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/642","id":123132069,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyMzEzMjA2OQ==","user":{"login":"vesense","id":6711230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MTEyMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6711230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense","html_url":"https://github.com/vesense","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-21T02:33:40Z","updated_at":"2015-07-21T02:33:40Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@HeartSaVioR

For e.g. if the rotation happens after we record the offset for txnid in index file but before any data is written we can lose track of the data file.</p>\n\n<p>A few options are :-</p>\n\n<p>1. Support only size based rotation policy to keep it simple.<br/>\n2. Automatically turn off exactly once in HdfsState (with warnings in logs) if TimedRotation policy is chosen.<br/>\n3. Add another implementation of HdfsState where exactly-once semantics is supported and can only take sized based rotation policy.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612560563/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612580230","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4785#issuecomment-2612580230","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4785","id":2612580230,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI1ODAyMzA=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-21T06:44:51Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T13:51:53Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=githubbot\">githubbot</a>:</i>\n<p>Github user caofangkun commented on a diff in the pull request:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/640#discussion_r35073778\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/640#discussion_r35073778</a></p>\n\n<p>    &#8212; Diff: storm-core/src/clj/backtype/storm/scheduler/DefaultScheduler.clj &#8212;<br/>\n    @@ -18,7 +18,7 @@<br/>\n       (:require <span class=\"error\">&#91;backtype.storm.scheduler.EvenScheduler :as EvenScheduler&#93;</span>)<br/>\n       (:import [backtype.storm.scheduler IScheduler Topologies<br/>\n Cluster TopologyDetails WorkerSlot SchedulerAssignment</p>\n<ul class=\"alternate\" type=\"square\">\n\t<li>EvenScheduler ExecutorDetails])<br/>\n    +    EvenScheduler])\n\t<ul class=\"alternate\" type=\"square\">\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<ul class=\"alternate\" type=\"square\">\n\t\t\t<li>End diff &#8211;</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>    @chuanlei <br/>\n    Yes, It's unnecessary.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612580230/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
