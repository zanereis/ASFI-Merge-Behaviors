The structure and implementation has been refactored. Could you spend some time in reviewing it again?\r\n\r\nBesides the graph runtime factory, there are 2 changes needs to be noticed.\r\n\r\n1. In `src/runtime/module.cc`, change the `query_import` logic to allow we could look up function beyond 2 levels. (for example, we could have `x` module -> `y` module -> `cpu` host side -> `gpu` side. This is been exposed in multi models graph runtime factory packaging)\r\n\r\n2. In `graph runtime factory`, we need `tvm::Map` to store params and return to python side. However, inside its implementation, it has one `static constexpr array`. Its definition in the `tvm/node/container.cc` (not compiled into `libtvmruntime.so`). This will have problem (`undefined reference`) inside `libtvmruntime.so` if we use `tvm::Map`.

I looked more into your error and it looks like I overlooked testing bundle_dynamic most recently. that is fixable, however...\r\n\r\nI did some more investigation and there are a couple of problems:\r\n1. I believe the performance regression is related to switching to `c` compiler, based on some profiling.\r\n2. with the CRT changes proposed in this PR, we can't use `--system-lib` because the global CRT memory manager needs to be initialized before functions can be registered, and the current `--system-lib` approach registers functions in static initialization. especially for targeting embedded bare-metal systems, I think it would be wise to allow a way to do arbitrary initialization before requiring use of TVM components.\r\n3. I tried using just plain `llvm` to avoid/prove the performance regression; however, there isn't a way to create a statically-linked non-system-lib right now (i.e. see [codegen init here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/blob/master/src/target/llvm/llvm_module.cc#L209)). i'd like to fix this, but I don't want to make this PR any larger than it is right now.\r\n4. finally, all of this is conspiring to make the `bundle_deploy` make situation more complex. bundle_deploy produces 3 targets: C main statically-linked against CRT runtime, c++ main() dynamically loading pure-c CRT, and c++ main dynamically loading c++ Runtime. the last one requires --system-lib, while the other two can't have it. so we'll need to produce a model/test_model that targets the c++ runtime to keep the last target alive.\r\n\r\nin a future PR, I plan to add an additional flag to the target string --runtime=<crt|c++>. this flag would allow us to produce a statically-linked llvm module compatible with the C runtime. would it be okay to do the following til then:\r\n1. use `c` module for all CRT bundle_deploy targets\r\n2. build 2 copies of test_model and model: one for CRT and one for c++ runtime\r\n3. for now, CRT targets will need to take a performance regression until we can re-enable the llvm module approach according to my plan above.\r\n\r\nmaybe @tqchen has more thoughts here?\r\n\r\nalso, it would be helpful if we could add this app to the CI somehow. any thoughts on that?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/656878983/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/656923788","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/5921#issuecomment-656923788","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5921","id":656923788,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1NjkyMzc4OA==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-10T22:35:31Z","updated_at":"2020-07-10T22:35:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I think it is fine to just build for crt and not targeting c++ for now, as long as it works.

We will send an RFC to discuss this.\r\n- Move `src/auto_schedule/utils.h::ThreadPool` to `src/support/parallle_for.h` (create a new file)\r\n- Consolidate the usage of `python/tvm/auto_schedule/utils.py::get_const_int`, `python/tvm/auto_schedule/utils.py::get_const_tuple` in the whole TVM code base.\r\n- Improve the hash of `LoopState` and `TransformStep`. Try to implement it with `SHashReduce`, `SEqualReduce`\r\n- Improve the record serialization format. Do not use only a hash key as the workload key. Try to use a relay subgraph as the hash key.\r\n\r\n@jroesch @jwfromm @yangjunpro @MarisaKirisame @junrushao1994 @FrozenGene  Please take another look and approve.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/657068540/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/657107026","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/5235#issuecomment-657107026","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5235","id":657107026,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1NzEwNzAyNg==","user":{"login":"hzfan","id":18756967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NzU2OTY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18756967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan","html_url":"https://github.com/hzfan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-11T18:21:53Z","updated_at":"2020-07-11T18:21:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"CI's green. @tqchen @kazum","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/657107026/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/657168012","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6039#issuecomment-657168012","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6039","id":657168012,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1NzE2ODAxMg==","user":{"login":"anijain2305","id":13822661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODIyNjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13822661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305","html_url":"https://github.com/anijain2305","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-12T03:11:33Z","updated_at":"2020-07-12T03:11:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@icemelon9 @eric-haibin-lin @shoubhik \r\n\r\nPlease review","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/657168012/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/657198319","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/5921#issuecomment-657198319","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5921","id":657198319,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1NzE5ODMxOQ==","user":{"login":"liangfu","id":857821,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1NzgyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/857821?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu","html_url":"https://github.com/liangfu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-12T09:41:48Z","updated_at":"2020-07-12T09:41:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks @areusch for contributing, and thanks @tqchen and @weberlo for reviewing.

Does not have to change now, but let us change the use of ThreadPool to parallel_for abstraction.\r\n\r\nDoes that means to just modify ThreadPool to ParallelFor now?

In my opinion the written English parts i.e comments, explanations, etc could still use some improvement with both content and grammar and I would propose in general that we do some at least 1 or 2 rounds of full documentation polish (comments, examples, tests, tutorials, etc) before we officially release a feature (in this case when all of Ansor is landed in master). We tried to do this with Relay but I think we should continue to strive to do a better job with new features like this.\r\n\r\nThanks! That would be of great help since I'm not a native speaker.
