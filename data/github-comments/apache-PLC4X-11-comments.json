It looks like the Activate Session Request from PLC4X to the OPCUA server gets sent out 10 seconds after receiving the previous response from the OPCUA server.\r\n\r\nLooking at the code to see what could delay it within the Activate Session Request  logic, there is a few calls to look up the hostname.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/plc4x/assets/15604556/df107e4a-0994-4192-b8ad-a0a2e79c5bdb)\r\n\r\nAs the request does eventually get sent out, I suspect that one of these calls is taking too long too complete. Can you please try adding the OPCUA server hostname in the Hosts file on the client.\r\n\r\nSomething similar to this.\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/47031687/getcanonicalhostname-is-very-slow\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/1632938963/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/1633109549","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/plc4x/issues/1027#issuecomment-1633109549","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/1027","id":1633109549,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBtifa85hV0Yt","user":{"login":"chrisdutz","id":651105,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MTEwNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/651105?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdutz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-12T19:43:03Z","updated_at":"2023-07-12T19:43:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"That sort of sounds like a timeout ... right?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/1633109549/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/1633608588","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/plc4x/issues/1027#issuecomment-1633608588","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/1027","id":1633608588,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBtifa85hXuOM","user":{"login":"hutcheb","id":15604556,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjA0NTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15604556?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hutcheb","html_url":"https://github.com/hutcheb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hutcheb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hutcheb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hutcheb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hutcheb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hutcheb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hutcheb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hutcheb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hutcheb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hutcheb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-13T06:09:24Z","updated_at":"2023-07-13T06:09:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yeah, that's what I'm suspecting.

This is the case that breaks the cache in my case, as that connection is no longer usable. I think a timeout in the leased connection should propagate into the real connection. Making the real connection invalid. Else the client has no way of removing the real connection from the connection cache.\r\nThis one is the second test.\r\n\r\nI see 2 solutions. Either propagate the timeout or allow the client to manually invalidate a connection from the cache","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/1653113922/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/1653116776","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/plc4x/issues/900#issuecomment-1653116776","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/900","id":1653116776,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBtifa85iiI9o","user":{"login":"chrisdutz","id":651105,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MTEwNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/651105?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdutz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-27T08:13:03Z","updated_at":"2023-07-27T08:13:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Well I did locally change the LeasedConnection to simply react on Exception instead of PlcRuntimeException ... this should now catch timeout errors too ... but I'm looking, if we shouldn't be catcing the timeouts and converting them to Plc-exceptions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/1653116776/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/1653121824","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/plc4x/issues/900#issuecomment-1653121824","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/900","id":1653121824,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBtifa85iiKMg","user":{"login":"chrisdutz","id":651105,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MTEwNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/651105?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdutz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-27T08:16:21Z","updated_at":"2023-07-27T08:16:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Think I found it ... so the NettyHashTimerTimeoutManager.java in line 54 creates a Timeout exception ... this is not a PlcException or PlcRuntimeException, so it falls outside all catch blocks ...
