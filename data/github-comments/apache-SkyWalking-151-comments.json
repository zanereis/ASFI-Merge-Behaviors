However it is human being's mistake that table config is missing, rather than program which just needs to look at the configuraion whether it is correct or not. Even we missed some sharding table rule, SS can share one DB's stress as well. Imagining, if there is no sharding rule, all the tables will be put into one DB.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand,  indeed configuration of `user_*` can reduce the likelihood of mistakes and SS should shadow more configuration detail and simply user's work and understanding.\r\nCurrently, i am sorry that SS can not do that well, but what you worried also gave me some new ideas to make it better.  Thanks very much.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/590027379/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/590037930","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/4399#issuecomment-590037930","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/4399","id":590037930,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5MDAzNzkzMA==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-23T08:06:37Z","updated_at":"2020-02-23T08:06:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@JaredTan95 The Nginx LUA first version has been finished.

Most cases i got are to shard tables like t_order and t_order_item, at this moment wildcard is not needed.\r\n\r\nI am not following, why setting `t_order*` for both `t_order` and `t_order_item` is not reasonable?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/590192000/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/590192873","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/4399#issuecomment-590192873","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/4399","id":590192873,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5MDE5Mjg3Mw==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-24T07:15:51Z","updated_at":"2020-02-24T07:22:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"About tests\r\n1.
