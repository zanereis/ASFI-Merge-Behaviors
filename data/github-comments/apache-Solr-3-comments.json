thoughts while playing around:\r\n\r\n- [x] I would like to be able to populate the example document with a document that exists. Maybe a button in the query results.\r\n- [x] docValues should be enabled by default when creating a fieldType/field\r\n- [x] Do we recommend the use of `useDocValuesAsStored` instead of `stored`?\r\n- [x] When you analyze the fields it sometimes brings up a question about language and some options.

My conclusion was that for back compat reasons the docValues would need to match stored fields behaviour -- _I will add a commit with proposed changes shortly_ -- and that what looks like a \"string\" value in the implementation is for \"boolean\" values only really i.e. F/0 and T/1 and when number values are required a number field type would/should be used instead.\r\n\r\n_And advance apologies, the commit has multiple things in one commit though I've tried to at least describe in the commit message details what is in it.

@cpoerschke! :)\r\n> My conclusion was that for back compat reasons the docValues would need to match stored fields behaviour -- _I will add a commit with proposed changes shortly_ -- and that what looks like a \"string\" value in the implementation is for \"boolean\" values only really i.e. F/0 and T/1 and when number values are required a number field type would/should be used instead.\r\n\r\nI just had the time to look through your changes.\r\nAlthough I liked the possibility to also handle numbers that are present in a string field, I agree that one should use a numeric field for that. One shouldn't expect the code to handle such cases.\r\nI think your changes made the functionalities that are supported much cleaner.

I addressed most of your concerns but there's some nuance around a few of your requests:\r\n\r\n>  I would like to be able to populate the example document with a document that exists. Maybe a button in the query results.\r\n\r\nI haven't implemented this yet. The query results only include sample documents already, so maybe you want to revise the sample documents in the paste text area? I think that's a valid thing to do and will think about this some more. My only concern would be adding another option that may complicate the experience. Can you elaborate on the user experience you want here?\r\n\r\n> Do we recommend the use of useDocValuesAsStored instead of stored?\r\n\r\nI'm not sure about whether that is a recommendation? Seems reasonable to me that if you're already using DocValues, then `useDocValuesAsStored` seems more efficient from a storage perspective (if you store and use doc values, then seems like you're doing double storage), but maybe there is some performance hit for doing this? I can certainly turn that off if we don't like defaulting to stored=false and useDocValuesAsStored=true.\r\n\r\n> When you analyze the fields it sometimes brings up a question about language and some options. Not clear that this is talking about the entire schema. Would be better to highlight the configName in the menu.\r\n\r\nThere are some gremlins in that jstree we're using where the selected node doesn't always show as selected in the tree. I've tried to improve this with my latest commit and seems to be rendering correctly. When the root node is selected, you see the panel with languages and options. Those apply to the entire schema. I added the schema name to that panel to help make this clear.\r\n\r\n> In the future it would be nice to have information on each of the options. Not sure what the best way to go about this is though.\r\n\r\nI think some of the options are pretty confusing and need supporting documentation, so have deferred to the ref guide via the help icon links vs. adding more docs directly in the Schema Designer UI.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/848845362/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/848853798","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/42#issuecomment-848853798","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/42","id":848853798,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0ODg1Mzc5OA==","user":{"login":"thelabdude","id":417074,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzA3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/417074?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thelabdude","html_url":"https://github.com/thelabdude","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thelabdude/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thelabdude/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thelabdude/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thelabdude/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thelabdude/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thelabdude/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thelabdude/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thelabdude/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thelabdude/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-26T15:12:08Z","updated_at":"2021-05-26T15:12:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @epugh ... my latest commit should address most of your concerns ...\r\n\r\n> when \"Analyzing your sample data, schema will load momentarily\" text comes up, could we swap the gear for a moving animated gear icon?\r\n\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n> download products a file called \"download\", not a \"download.zip\", or even better... \"techproducts_configset.zip\"\r\n\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n> Is the config a config? Or a ConfigSet????\r\n\r\nWhere in the UI are you seeing mention of config? I've tried to refer to `Configset` but that's not really a term new users would really understand anyway, so I've taken some liberties on just focusing on `schema` in most places.\r\n\r\n> I wish the folder icon when clicked on would open it. Versus the small > arrow. This I find annoying in the SolrCloud ZK tree as well, though there you might argue you want to look at metadata.. I wish there it did both showing metadata and opened, and on schema designer it opened!\r\n\r\nDouble-click works, but I couldn't figure out how to get it to open on single-click. May not be supported by the underlying `jstree` UI component we're using.\r\n\r\n> I wonder if you could get more screen space by having any kind of paning close/open options?\r\n\r\nWe could probably allow closing the Sample documents area once the data is loaded, to give more room for the Schema Editor (middle section). There's also some wasted space on the right for Text Analysis if you're not looking at text fields. I'm curious what the minimum resolution / screen size we should design this for though? Having a view of your sample docs, schema, text analysis, and query tester form / results all in once place is crucial to the design.\r\n\r\n> in the facet listing, when you shift click you get all between the first and the second click, versus shift click letting you pick them individually, which I think is what you wanted!\r\n\r\nOk, I removed the tip about using shift as I'm not sure how it works on Windows. On Mac, it's cmd + click to select non-adjacent items. I guess we can just assume people will figure it out on their OS.\r\n\r\n> are there any features that you expose that NO ONE should ever use and could be removed???\r\n\r\nNot sure? You tell me ;-) Solr schema design is a complicated process and I've designed a solution to help with that, but the fact remains it's still pretty complicated but at least we can give users quick feedback and let them iterate in a safe manner.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/848853798/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/848873024","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/42#issuecomment-848873024","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/42","id":848873024,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0ODg3MzAyNA==","user":{"login":"HoustonPutman","id":3376422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzY0MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3376422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman","html_url":"https://github.com/HoustonPutman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-26T15:34:28Z","updated_at":"2021-05-26T15:34:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> > I would like to be able to populate the example document with a document that exists.

The last thing to be done here I think is splitting up the API commands into separate classes as per @dsmiley's feedback.\r\n\r\nOn that note - there's a bug that complicates doing this right now.  Each API class is registered individually by \"ApiBag\", which stores an Api object per HTTP method, per path.  When all commands for a given method and path are in the same class - this works well.  When commands for that method and path are split across different classes though - the registration for each one overrides the registrations before it.\r\n\r\nI've highlighted the line where this happens [here](https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/81/files#diff-20733c59d42a1a1a2b4164485888dc067db372fa2c7fdffb30d48c04ae2bed74R168), and suggested a few workarounds.

The range of values for the two metrics are quite different. CPU usage is limited to 0 to 1.0. Load average is unbounded, and useful limits are much greater than 1.0, typically set at the number of CPUs in the system. On a 32-way system, a good limit would be around 32.\n\nAlso, load average is not a CPU metric. It is a “system load” metric.

If starting with a clean slate, perhaps the \"correct\" behavior should be as you've outlined -- but then I would think you'd want the same strict \"non-splitting\" behavior for integer fields. My gut reaction is that this is a very unusual use case (configuring a StrField or integer field as `qf`). In fact, a strong argument in principal for \"strict\" non-splitting behavior would be to effectively discourage this kind of configuration in the first place!\r\n\r\nUltimately though I think I'm converging on agreement with https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/129/files#r638071458 ... tbh I'm having a hard time imagining a use case where the configuration in question (or its current behavior) would be desirable; but assuming there may be such use cases already in place, this change could surely disrupt them.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the fact that keyword-tokenized text fields currently work \"correctly\" (as defined above) could be employed to address this issue going forward for certain use-cases, rather than changing existing behavior? Keyword-tokenized text would also seem more appropriate to the `edismax` use-case, by providing analysis for text _normalization_ (the lack of which strikes me as the most unusual aspect of configuring StrField `qf`). \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/853380214/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/853410595","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/96#issuecomment-853410595","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/96","id":853410595,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg1MzQxMDU5NQ==","user":{"login":"wrunderwood","id":10732577,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzMyNTc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10732577?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrunderwood","html_url":"https://github.com/wrunderwood","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrunderwood/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrunderwood/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrunderwood/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrunderwood/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrunderwood/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrunderwood/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrunderwood/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrunderwood/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrunderwood/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-02T21:57:52Z","updated_at":"2023-08-30T12:15:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Anyone running this on a multi-CPU machine should disable it immediately.\n\nThe documentation says it will reject traffic when total CPU usage reaches a limit, but it will really reject traffic when a single CPU reaches that limit or when one process is blocked on IO.
