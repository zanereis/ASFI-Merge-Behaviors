@zenozeng Thanks for this patch, this is very useful to us.\r\n\r\nWe are facing [FLINK-13645](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-13645) again after Flink-1.16 upgrade. It is working fine on Flink-1.15. Looks [FLINK-15635](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-15635) is causing the regression.\r\nDo you know how to fix this issue.

I was doing a little reading about shading and came across the following comment.  Therefore the shading prefix change.\r\n\r\n> Please avoid shading a package into a subpackage of its own like com.fake to com.fake.shaded. You could potentially be getting some kind of recursive problem and depending on the algorithm used for replacing package and path names you could be lucky and it works or not. In your case it works for binaries because Maven Shade uses an ASM utility class for relocating binaries, which seems to do a good job.\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MSHADE-252?focusedCommentId=17314377&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-17314377","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/1373780697/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/1373918746","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/4545#issuecomment-1373918746","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/4545","id":1373918746,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAfU5DM5R5FYa","user":{"login":"Reamer","id":454320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NDMyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/454320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer","html_url":"https://github.com/Reamer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-06T17:23:41Z","updated_at":"2023-01-06T17:23:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Next error\r\n```\r\nError:  Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-shade-plugin:3.2.2:shade (default) on project zeppelin-jupyter-interpreter-shaded: Error creating shaded jar: duplicate entry: META-INF/services/org.apache.zeppelin.jupyter.io.grpc.NameResolverProvider -> [Help 1]\r\nError:  \r\nError:  To see the full stack trace of the errors, re-run Maven with the -e switch.\r\nError:  Re-run Maven using the -X switch to enable full debug logging.\r\nError:  \r\nError:  For more information about the errors and possible solutions, please read the following articles:\r\nError:  [Help 1] http://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MAVEN/MojoExecutionException\r\nError:  \r\nError:  After correcting the problems, you can resume the build with the command\r\nError:    mvn <args> -rf :zeppelin-jupyter-interpreter-shaded\r\nError: Process completed with exit code 1.\r\n```\r\n\r\nLooks like the following issue [MSHADE-425](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MSHADE-425)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/1373918746/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/1374326089","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/4541#issuecomment-1374326089","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/4541","id":1374326089,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAfU5DM5R6o1J","user":{"login":"jongyoul","id":3612566,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTI1NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3612566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul","html_url":"https://github.com/jongyoul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-07T01:09:03Z","updated_at":"2023-01-07T01:09:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thank you for the description.
