I suggest going back through commits and figuring out which commit did the formatting, and then revert the formatting without breaking the changes that you wanted to do. There probably is a smarter way, but I am unaware of such.\r\n\r\nThe legacy had mainly been formatted in three commits. I reversed the hunks of these commits that were not related to our fft implementation. Since I had to do this for each file individually I added a \"reverse formatting\" commit for each file. Unfortunately two tests are failing now (see [**.functions.federated.monitoring.**,**.functions.federated.multitenant.**](https://github.com/apache/systemds/actions/runs/7837353259/job/21398216259?pr=1983#logs)\r\n[**.component.c**.**](https://github.com/apache/systemds/actions/runs/7837353259/job/21398211615?pr=1983#logs)). \r\nI think that these tests have nothing to with our code though, as the FFT and IFFT functions still function as expected.

i like the change. seems like you found a few bugs in the process.\r\n\r\nCan we add a few more tests, where \r\n\r\n1. a multi return layer goes into a multi return layer, \r\n2. a TestLayerImp goes to Multi to multi \r\n\r\nand a few more variations.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso can we verify that the layers get updated correctly on the backwards pass.\r\n\r\nOnce these are added I would consider the PR finished and ready for merging.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/2178243738/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/2180171463","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/2014#issuecomment-2180171463","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/2014","id":2180171463,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArxUbc6B8sbH","user":{"login":"Baunsgaard","id":9947148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5NDcxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9947148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard","html_url":"https://github.com/Baunsgaard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-20T08:58:05Z","updated_at":"2024-06-20T08:58:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closing
