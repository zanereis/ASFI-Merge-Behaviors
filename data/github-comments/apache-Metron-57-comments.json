The difference was dramatic. \r\n\r\n- The Unified topology _performed roughly 3.4 times faster than Split-Join._\r\n\r\nBoth topologies in this side-by-side test included the same fixes, including the Guava cache problem fixed in #947. The tests included two enrichments:\r\n* GeoIP enrichment; `geo := GEO_GET(ip_dst_addr)`\r\n* Compute-only Stellar enrichment; `local := IN_SUBNET(ip_dst_addr, '192.168.0.0/24')`\r\n\r\nThe number one driver of performance is the cache hit rate, which is heavily dependent on what your data looks-like.  With these enrichments, that's driven by how varied the `ip_dst_addr` is in the data.  \r\n\r\nI tested both of these topologies with different sets of data intended to either increase or decrease that cache hit rate.  The differences between the two topologies were fairly consistent across the different data sets. \r\n\r\nWhen running these topologies, reasonably well-tuned, on the same data, I was able to consistently maintain 70,000 events per second with the Split/Join topology.  In the same environment, I was able to maintain 312,000 events per second using the Unified topology.  \r\n\r\nThe raw throughput numbers are relative and depend on how much hardware you are willing to throw at the problem.  I was running on 3 nodes dedicated to running the Enrichment topology only.  But with the same data, on the same hardware, the difference was 3.4 times.  That's big.\r\n\r\nPushing as much as you can into a single executor and avoiding network hops is definitely the way to go here.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/370576471/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/370579077","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/940#issuecomment-370579077","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/940","id":370579077,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MDU3OTA3Nw==","user":{"login":"ben-manes","id":378614,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3ODYxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/378614?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-manes","html_url":"https://github.com/ben-manes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-manes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-manes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-manes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-manes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-manes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-manes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-manes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-manes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-manes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-05T21:50:08Z","updated_at":"2018-03-05T21:52:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Do you know what the hit rates were, for the same data set, between Guava and Caffeine?

Guava uses a `ConcurrentLinkedQueue` and an `AtomicInteger` to record its size, per segment. When a read occurs, it records that in the queue and then drains it under the segment's lock (via tryLock) to replay the events. This is similar to Caffeine, which uses optimized structures instead. I intended the CLQ & counter as baseline scaffolding for replacement, as it is an obvious bottleneck, but I could never get it replaced despite advocating for it. The penalty of draining the buffers is amortized, but unfortunately this buffer isn't capped.\r\n\r\nSince there would be a higher hit rate with a larger cache, the reads would be recorded more often. Perhaps contention there and the penalty of draining the queue is more observable than a cache miss. That's still surprising since a cache miss is usually more expensive I/O. Is the loader doing expensive work in your case?\r\n\r\nCaffeine gets around this problem by using more optimal buffers and being lossy (on reads only) if it can't keep up. By default it delegates the amortized maintenance work to a ForkJoinPool to avoid user-facing latencies, since you'll want those variances to be tight. Much of that can be back ported onto Guava for a nice boost.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/370592908/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/370596643","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/940#issuecomment-370596643","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/940","id":370596643,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MDU5NjY0Mw==","user":{"login":"cestella","id":540359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/540359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella","html_url":"https://github.com/cestella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-05T22:52:21Z","updated_at":"2018-03-05T23:01:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"In this case, the loader isn't doing anything terribly expensive, though it may in a real scenario (incur a hbase get or some more expensive computation).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/370596643/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/370599483","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/940#issuecomment-370599483","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/940","id":370599483,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MDU5OTQ4Mw==","user":{"login":"ben-manes","id":378614,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3ODYxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/378614?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-manes","html_url":"https://github.com/ben-manes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-manes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-manes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-manes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-manes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-manes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-manes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-manes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-manes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-manes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-05T23:03:42Z","updated_at":"2018-03-05T23:03:42Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Interesting.

I am assuming the semantics of this would be a \"max of maxes\".  So if I have a list of stats objects, I compare the max of each one.  Whichever max is the greatest, that stats object gets returned.  The MIN function would just be a \"min of mins\".\r\n\r\nDoes that match your use case?  Is this the right approach?\r\n\r\nGiven those semantics, I think the 'Comparable' approach could work, but with a twist.  You can't just make the Stats objects Comparable.  Because how do you compare them?  By the average, median, min or max?  There is not one way to do it that is broadly applicable.\r\n\r\nThe means of comparison for the MAX function should use the max of a stats object.  \r\nThe means of comparison for the MIN function should use the min of the stats object. \r\n\r\nOne way to implement this is to create a class that wraps a Stats object and implements the Comparable interface.  In the case of MAX, the wrapper will compare using the max of the underlying stats object.  In the case of MIN function, the wrapper will compare using the min of the underlying stats object.   With the appropriate wrapper, the current logic would work with a list of mixed types.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/370841349/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/370846110","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/948#issuecomment-370846110","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/948","id":370846110,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MDg0NjExMA==","user":{"login":"JonZeolla","id":1385510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODU1MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1385510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla","html_url":"https://github.com/JonZeolla","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-06T16:44:38Z","updated_at":"2018-03-06T16:44:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I

We use that in metron-config and metron-alerts.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/371235191/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/371271692","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/949#issuecomment-371271692","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/949","id":371271692,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MTI3MTY5Mg==","user":{"login":"merrimanr","id":311928,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTkyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/311928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr","html_url":"https://github.com/merrimanr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-07T20:21:15Z","updated_at":"2018-03-07T20:21:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"There are also shuffle groupings in the enrichment and profiler topologies.
