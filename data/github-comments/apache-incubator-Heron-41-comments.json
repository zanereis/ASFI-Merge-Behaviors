It seems like a summary table view actually. We could envision a detailed table view that shows the instances on each container. One suggestion would be to add line breaks to the table shown at container boundaries. We'd need to add a container id and instance id column and remove parallelism in that context.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/268034420/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/268039302","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1619#issuecomment-268039302","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1619","id":268039302,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2ODAzOTMwMg==","user":{"login":"objmagic","id":3656079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NTYwNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3656079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic","html_url":"https://github.com/objmagic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-19T18:26:11Z","updated_at":"2016-12-19T18:29:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@billonahill that's a good idea.

The custom packing impl was not using `PackingPlanBuilder`.\r\n- The scheduler should still assert that none of the containers received in the `PackingPlan` are empty, since users can implement their own packing plans that could be invalid.
