By default COW table should not have any async table service enabled, while MOR table have async compaction enabled.  So the auto config adjustment for metadata table is different for different types of tables.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1069762836/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1069776883","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/4286#issuecomment-1069776883","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/4286","id":1069776883,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM4_w3_z","user":{"login":"hudi-bot","id":79415918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDE1OTE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79415918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/hudi-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-17T00:33:19Z","updated_at":"2022-03-17T00:33:19Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\nMeta data\n{\n  \"version\" : 1,\n  \"metaDataEntries\" : [ {\n    \"hash\" : \"4a459976c56d12c1beb46284862113b866bba284\",\n    \"status\" : \"DELETED\",\n    \"url\" : \"https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=4202\",\n    \"triggerID\" : \"4a459976c56d12c1beb46284862113b866bba284\",\n    \"triggerType\" : \"PUSH\"\n  }, {\n    \"hash\" : \"4e607fb282b9098d297c56a8fa1f367dd8294201\",\n    \"status\" : \"DELETED\",\n    \"url\" : \"https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=4243\",\n    \"triggerID\" : \"4e607fb282b9098d297c56a8fa1f367dd8294201\",\n    \"triggerType\" : \"PUSH\"\n  }, {\n    \"hash\" : \"dbe231115001abd287e8d948d51011b708c02f7c\",\n    \"status\" : \"DELETED\",\n    \"url\" : \"https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=6984\",\n    \"triggerID\" : \"dbe231115001abd287e8d948d51011b708c02f7c\",\n    \"triggerType\" : \"PUSH\"\n  }, {\n    \"hash\" : \"c2738a5a1cd6f5ea8cffa966d7dc332f2d211f29\",\n    \"status\" : \"FAILURE\",\n    \"url\" : \"https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=7008\",\n    \"triggerID\" : \"c2738a5a1cd6f5ea8cffa966d7dc332f2d211f29\",\n    \"triggerType\" : \"PUSH\"\n  } ]\n}-->\n## CI report:\n\n* c2738a5a1cd6f5ea8cffa966d7dc332f2d211f29 Azure: [FAILURE](https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=7008) \n\n<details>\n<summary>Bot commands</summary>\n  @hudi-bot supports the following commands:\n\n - `@hudi-bot run azure` re-run the last Azure build\n</details>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1069776883/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1069788126","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/5047#issuecomment-1069788126","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/5047","id":1069788126,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM4_w6ve","user":{"login":"tjtoll","id":56052873,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MDUyODcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56052873?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjtoll","html_url":"https://github.com/tjtoll","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjtoll/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjtoll/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjtoll/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjtoll/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjtoll/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjtoll/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjtoll/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjtoll/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjtoll/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-17T00:50:58Z","updated_at":"2022-03-17T02:04:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I am experiencing the same exact problem - also with AWS Glue.

We first create `ListingBasedRollbackRequest` (there's not a lot of value in this abstraction since it is very shallow in itself, only contains `type` of the rollback and `partitionPath` which is obviously not enough to do the rollback)\r\n2. Then we actually create `HoodieRollbackRequest` based on the former ones\r\n\r\nInstead, we should combine these 2 steps into 1 very we directly generate `HoodieRollbackRequest` (similar to what MarkerBasedRollbackStrategy is doing). Flow would look like following in that case:\r\n1. If instant is completed — we rely on `CommitMetadata` to produce HoodieRollbackInstant\r\n2. If instant is incomplete — we actually list the files and do the instant based filtering\r\n\r\ncc @nsivabalan @xushiyan

Bloom filters will be effective only if your record keys have some timestamp characteristics and so we can trim few file groups with just min and max values of record keys stored in them.\r\n> \r\n> So, I would recommend you to try out \"SIMPLE\" index instead. for random or large updates, this might work out better. Do give [this](https://hudi.apache.org/blog/2020/11/11/hudi-indexing-mechanisms/) blog a read to understand index types in hudi. Also, you can check out the configs for simple index [here](https://hudi.apache.org/docs/next/configurations#hoodiesimpleindexparallelism).\r\n\r\nIs it only the record key having the timestamp characteristics? Or it is the partitioning as well? For example, if I have a random record key but my partitions are by date is BLOOM still beneficial? \r\n\r\nAlso, on tables that I do have an incrementing record key, why doesn't Hudi sort those before writing them? The files it writes have huge/overlapping ranges of record
