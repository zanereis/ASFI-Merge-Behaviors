We've also been able to create our own extensions for chart types that are not offered out of the box (Like Packed Bubbles ) using D3's pack algorithm. ECharts offers all a ton of options out of the box to configure our charts and the necessary hooks to extend it when necessary with things like `echarts.registerLayout`. We are appreciative of all the work you've put in to make it the best charting library for big data 👍
