Still seeing the issue. My steps are below.

Now I want to continue to iterate on it and add new features and charts without disrupting the prod version people can see, until all testing and QA is done. \r\n\r\nAnd there are two types of changes I can see being made. One is if you add a new chart, or feature to the dashboard, and make no changes to the datasource. The second is if you need to update the data source, like add new columns, switch from a personal schema table to a prod table etc.\r\n\r\nI think the above flow Hugh described would work for the first use case, but not the second. Currently when you copy the dashboard it uses the same data source in the charts in both the original and the copied version. So any changes you make to the data source with affect both dashboards. It would be great when you copy the dashboard to be able to easily switch out the data source for all charts in the copied version so you can make changes. And then once happy with the changes be able to push that to the prod version of the dashboard.
