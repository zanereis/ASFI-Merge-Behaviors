Similar to [1].\n- B: Use [1], but replace the overflow situations with a Top and a Bottom that absorb/saturate things correspondingly. Similar concepts here [2].\n- C: Use [3], (or reimplement parts of it), which just carrys out an overflowing operation in the lifted BigInt counterpart.\n\nI think Approach A is bad as when dealing with big data we'd almost certainly run into overflowing in the future & we don't want an exception to stop the whole pipeline. Approach B is reasonable in that whenever we see a Top/Bottom, we could just disable/special-case the cost estimation. Approach C looks okay too but may be too heavy.\n\nLet me know what do you guys think should go into this PR.\n\n[1]
