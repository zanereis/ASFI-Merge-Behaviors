I've figured it out. This has been plaguing me for days.\r\n\r\nI followed the stack trace to the following line:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/blob/2f08377f5c56f96389fb3a8e51844844537e118b/bookkeeper-server/src/main/java/org/apache/bookkeeper/net/BookieSocketAddress.java#L68\r\n\r\nIn short, EVERY address added via the ```pulsar-admin bookies set-bookie-rack``` command MUST be in the format of ```<FQDN>:<port>```. If it's not in the correct format (if there's no ```:``` found), it'll throw an ```UnknownHostException```. This should probably be documented much better, but I'm glad to at least get the fix on record.\r\n\r\n```java.lang.RuntimeException: java.net.UnknownHostException: koto-bk-aen-0``` is not very descriptive.\r\n\r\nE.g. (the proper format):\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"default\" : {\r\n    \"koto-bk-aen-0:3181\" : {\r\n      \"rack\" : \"/aen\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"koto-bk-aen-1:3181\" : {\r\n      \"rack\" : \"/aen\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks to @mkozioro for helping. If I wasn't told this was working with someone else's configuration, I never would have followed the stack trace.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nI'll leave it up to the maintainers of the project on whether or not they want to update the documentation with this information... If not, this issue can be closed
