Previous PR solves OpenCV + TVM slow performance and AutoTVM Python CPU affinity problem. However, previous PR has two problem:\r\n> \r\n>     * doesn't solve ARM  BIG.LITTLE heterogeneous multicores.\r\n>       For example, we have 2xA72 + 4xA53, previous pr will add all cpu to CPU SET even we call `config_thread_pool` to restrict TVM runs on 4 little cores. So, TVM_MASTER_THREAD could run A72 big core. This is not we want.\r\n>       Solution: we should restrict master in the little cpus or big cpus according to users's setting.\r\n\r\nThis approach needs to be added as comments in the code explaining how this is expected to work. Further I suspect it is TVM_BIND_MASTER_THREAD that you refer to above ?  What is the role of the TVM master thread ? Is it another thread that does compute or is it a \"controlling\" thread ? \r\n\r\n> \r\n>     * Not all Linux variant OS has `pthread_atfork`. For example, Alibaba's AliOS doesn't have this api.\r\n\r\npthread_atfork IIRC originally comes from the posix group from Issue 5 as documented [here](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/pthread_atfork.html). Checking the other libcs suggest that all other mainstream Linux runtimes like glibc, musl and bionic support this and thus are we working around a limitation of AliOS here ?\r\n\r\n\r\n>       Solution: unified android and linux's way. We will call `SetFullCpuAffinity` if we don't have `TVM_BIND_MASTER_THREAD`.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> @tqchen @yidawang @vinx13 @ajtulloch Could you help to review it?

Further I suspect it is TVM_BIND_MASTER_THREAD that you refer to above ? What is the role of the TVM master thread ? Is it another thread that does compute or is it a \"controlling\" thread ?\r\n\r\nTVM_BIND_MASTER_THREAD is related with `exclude_worker0` , the default value of `exclude_worker0` is false. https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/blob/master/include/tvm/runtime/threading_backend.h#L50. As the comment said, if it is false, we will make main thread compute worker0 and worker0 will not be launched in a new thread. Normally main thread doesn't have much to do. If TVM_BIND_MASTER_THREAD env var is set, we will bind the main thread be cpu core of `sorted_order_[0]` or `sorted_order_[-1]` (if we are in the little mode)\r\n\r\nSo previous solution is to let us not bind the master thread to be one specific core so that our master thread could run any cores. But previous solution omit one situation that ARM CPU has BIG.LITTLE, we can not add all cpus to CPU SET. It will result in main thread could run big core (even users specify tvm run little cores). Also could run little cores (even users specify tvm run big cores).\r\n\r\nThis PR solves this by restrict tvm master thread's cpu set. That is to say: if we are in the little mode, we should restrict master thread run only little cores. if we are in the big mode, we should restrict master thread run only big cores. Note: This could work well on x86 cpu too. Because x86 cpu doesn't have BIG.Little. our code implementation will use big_count_ to calculate the cpu cores by default. So master thread could run any cores.\r\n\r\nI will add comment to explain a bit in code.\r\n\r\n> pthread_atfork IIRC originally comes from the posix group from Issue 5 as documented here. Checking the other libcs suggest that all other mainstream Linux runtimes like glibc, musl and bionic support this and thus are we working around a limitation of AliOS here ?\r\n\r\nAliOS like some versions of Android, doesn't provide pthread_atfork. However, the key to solve this problem is doesn't restrict master thread bind to one specific core. So PR's solution could work fine on Linux / Android too. pthread_atfork is not a key or must.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/576208993/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/576223418","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4566#issuecomment-576223418","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4566","id":576223418,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NjIyMzQxOA==","user":{"login":"kice","id":3945950,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDU5NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3945950?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kice","html_url":"https://github.com/kice","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kice/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kice/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kice/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kice/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kice/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kice/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kice/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kice/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kice/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-20T11:03:39Z","updated_at":"2020-01-20T11:03:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yes it does, but this pr forgot to decode the byte to string.

For operators whose api and implementation would not be expected to change (pooling, elemwise op etc) it makes sense to have them in cpp only (and that is what we have currently). I also liked the recent effort which brought most of the relay build pipeline to cpp. A few days ago I sent a [PR](https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/pull/4751) which exposed some relay cpp functionality to python. Now that things are in cpp, this \"exposing\" can be done for any language (at least in principle).\r\n\r\nC++ on topi is a different story :) I believe the cpp only solution is simply not realistic because of \"human problem\". We always say cpp is something \"to strive for\" or \"to port over in the future\", but it's never been a hard requirement. Also it is not clear what makes API \"stable enough\" to deserve a cpp impl. As soon as people find a reason not to do cpp, the cpp impl never happens. Most people who add features to topi just want to get their immediate jobs done, so \"implement it in cpp\" is usually not high on their list.\r\n\r\nThis ambiguity has created situations that our cpp resize op is in. In addition to the \"outdated cpp\" problem, there are many topi operators that only exist in python, including \r\n* all sparse ops\r\n* most of the vision specific ops (rcnn, ssd, deformable conv) except for the reorg op (for yolo)\r\n* int8 and other lower bit ops\r\n* framework specific ops (depth to space, fifo buffer etc)\r\n\r\nand I'm sure there are others.\r\n\r\nIn summary,\r\n* I agree that the cpp only solution is desirable and something we should strive for, but in practice not realistic\r\n* Already too many inconsistencies on python vs cpp in topi. Most likely porting effort would not happen.  \r\n* The python only solution is the only viable option and basically it is already our status quo. We can keep the existing cpp impls that are useful, but we should make our python impl as the official one. This is also in line with the recent \"Unified IR\" initiative by @tqchen which, if I remember correctly, brings TVM to be more \"Python first\".\r\n\r\nI usually don't have a strong opinion on things, but I believe this topi python vs cpp duplication and inconsistency situation is the most ugly corner in our code base and so wanted to say something about it.
