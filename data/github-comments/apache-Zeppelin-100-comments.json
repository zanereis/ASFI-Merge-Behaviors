Thank you for contributing this. \nI have several questions. \n1. I think it needs `-it` option for running docker.\n   so The command to run zeppelin docker should be \n   `docker run --rm -it -p 8080:8080 -p 8081:8081 mahmoudelgamal/zeppelin-release:0.5.0 bash`\n2. What do you think of adding documents for this like [this](http://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.7.0-SNAPSHOT/install/spark_cluster_mode.html#spark-standalone-mode) ?\n3. I got an following error when I run the `Zeppelin Tutorial`, Could you take care a look this?\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3348133/19624728/1278843a-993f-11e6-935f-99b46f83c069.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/255574528/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/255574699","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1554#issuecomment-255574699","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1554","id":255574699,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NTU3NDY5OQ==","user":{"login":"prabhjyotsingh","id":674497,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NDQ5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/674497?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh","html_url":"https://github.com/prabhjyotsingh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-23T07:54:57Z","updated_at":"2016-10-23T07:55:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"know
