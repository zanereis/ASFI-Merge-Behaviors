there is one remaining problem in the stress test and that is caused by the fact that the test DurableClientSimpleDUnitTest.testReadyForEventsNotCalledImplicitlyForRegisterInterestWithCacheXML uses a server with a defined port number of 10188. So when the test starts up it references an cache.xml that has the port defined in it. This means that the test cannot be run in parallel with itself as is done through the stress test and be ok. Depending on timing it will have resource contention. This has been in there for quite some time and is not really a problem except in stress test.

like the idea of fixing this command for partition regions. The problem does exist that for partition region, the index creation is distributed to all the other servers, so subsequent `CreateIndexFunction` might get name conflict error. We can solve this by either of the two ways:\r\n1) In the `CreateIndexCommand`, if user is creating the index on a partition region, only send the function to one member, not all members. Use `GfshCommand.findAnyMembersForRegion` method to get just one member to execute the function.\r\n2) In the `CreateIndexFunction`,  when we get a `NameConflictException` or `IndexExistsException`, make the `CliFunctionResult` with a `StatusState.IGNORABLE`, this will make the command not consider this as a failure.\r\n\r\nEither of these two approaches should work.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/1116907135/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/1116994913","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/7629#issuecomment-1116994913","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/7629","id":1116994913,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAhObV85Ck_1h","user":{"login":"lgtm-com[bot]","id":43144390,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDMxNDQzOTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/17324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/lgtm-com","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-04T07:11:46Z","updated_at":"2022-05-04T07:11:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This pull request **fixes 1 alert** when merging a06a4e3c34c1800315a56da661e13fb32154d448 into 6f57745ce65583d49459d5cb120985d3b72e26af -

At the highest level it's not clear why (before this PR) it is necessary for an `InternalLocator` to add itself to the effective set of locators. The product has dynamic discovery features for locators across WAN, and I believe within the cluster too (TBD on that second point).\r\n> \r\n> If we decide it's really necessary to add the current locator to that set, the next question is: why are we doing it by modifying the `DistributionConfig.locators` and Java system property `gemfire.locators`. Those should be _immutable_. If we need to have a set of all known locators, it seems they should be managed in collection separate from the immutable configuration settings.\r\n> \r\n> If we assume that we do need to add the current locator to the set of known locators (as is done in this PR) there are some low-level coding considerations:\r\n> \r\n> 1. The PR uses string comparison to match locators. Rather than comparing strings, I believe we need to be comparing the entries in terms of their semantic components (host/address and port). We have numerous parsers for this locators format and I believe some allow whitespace around e.g. `[` and `]`. A naïve string comparison will be inaccurate. It appears that you started to do things this way (based on your refactoring of the parser in `GMSUtil` and then abandoned that change. I think that refactoring is valuable since it lets you avoid some unneeded functionality in `GMSUtil`.\r\n> 2. If we need side-effects, e.g. modifying the `DistributionConfig` and setting a Java system property, rather than burying it in a call chain: `getLocatorString` -> `configurePeerLocators` -> `setLocatorProperties`, it would be more understandable, and more testable to split the job into methods that compute new values without any side-effects, and methods that have side-effects. The latter should be named so it is clear that they have side-effects. Maybe we could have something like: `String addLocatorIfMissing(final String locators, final HostAndPort theLocator)` (a side-effect-free method) and the caller could compare the result to current value and if it differs it could call `void setLocatorProperties(String locatorsConfigValue)` (clearly a method with side-effects).\r\n\r\nI abandoned using the `GMSUtils` because it's an internal api in Membership. If I use that in the core module, it will break the api check. Do you want me to make GMSUtils to be public?\r\n\r\nRegarding the scope of the PR, I want to keep it to a minimal at this stage. We need to fix a specific problem introduced by 1.12 (the duplicate entry in the locators list).

After 1.15.0 is released, we can put the complete solution back in","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/1150466453/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/1151458738","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/7721#issuecomment-1151458738","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/7721","id":1151458738,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAhObV85Eod2y","user":{"login":"jake-at-work","id":6800791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MDA3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6800791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work","html_url":"https://github.com/jake-at-work","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-09T18:25:18Z","updated_at":"2022-06-09T18:25:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@DonalEvans what if we refactored a little to a method that takes function to execute and optionally ignores this specific exception, then we could at least deterministically test that part of the behavior and change in this PR. 🤷 \r\n```java\r\nprivate void doAndIgnoreRejectedExecutionExceptionIfStopping(final SomeFunctionalnterface someFunctionalThing) {\r\n  try {\r\n    someFunctionalThing.doIt();\r\n  } catch (RejectedExecutionException e) {\r\n    if (!isStopping) {\r\n      throw e;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n...\r\n      doAndIgnoreRejectedExecutionExceptionIfStopping(() ->\r\n        checkExecutor.execute(() -> {\r\n           try {\r\n             inlineCheckIfAvailable(initiator, cv, true, mbr, reason);\r\n           } catch (MembershipClosedException e) {\r\n             // shutting down\r\n           } catch (Exception e) {\r\n             logger.info(\"Unexpected exception while verifying member\", e);\r\n           }\r\n         }));\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Test\r\nvoid doAndIgnoreRejectedExecutionExceptionIfStoppingThrowsWhenNotStopping() {\r\n  gmsHealthMonitor.isStopping = true;\r\n  assertThatThrowBy(() -> gmsHealthMonitor.doAndIgnoreRejectedExecutionExceptionIfStopping(() -> {throw new RejectedExecutionException();})).isInstanceOf(RejectedExecutionException.class);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/1151458738/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/1151676410","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/7721#issuecomment-1151676410","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/7721","id":1151676410,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAhObV85EpS_6","user":{"login":"DonalEvans","id":17314657,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzE0NjU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17314657?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans","html_url":"https://github.com/DonalEvans","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-09T22:20:26Z","updated_at":"2022-06-09T22:20:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@pivotal-jbarrett Thanks for the advice!
