Here's how I'd recommend approaching it:\r\n\r\n* create a new interface solely for the purpose of only abstracting RegionCoprocessorEnvironment access called RegionContext. The interface would have at least two methods: getRegion and getConfiguration. We might need more if other methods are called in RegionCoprocessorEnvironment.\r\n* have two implementations of this interface: RegionCoprocessorContext and RegionShapshotContext. The constructor of RegionCoprocessorContext would take a RegionCoprocessorEnvironment as an argument, while the RegionShapshotContext would take a Region and Configuration.\r\n* do an across the board replace of RegionCoprocessorEnvironment with RegionContext. You can likely not do this for secondary index related code (org.apache.phoenix.hbase.index.Indexer and PhoenixTransactionalIndexer). You'll find out here if other methods are called from RegionCoprocessorEnvironment or ObserverContext (which can be dealt with in a variety of ways, for example by throwing an UnsupportedOperationException if need be in the snapshot implementation).\r\n* in the top level coprocessor methods that pass in RegionCoprocessorEnvironment (mostly abstract BaseScannerRegionObserver class), instantiate a RegionCoprocessorContext by passing in the RegionCoprocessorEnvironment. From this point onward, all access will go through the RegionContext interface.\r\n\r\nYou could do this refactoring completely separate from the PHOENIX-3744 so that you don't mix the two. Then PHOENIX-3744 would have something like a RegionScannerFactory (your RegionObserverUtil) that gives you back a RegionScanner given a RegionContext and you'd create a RegionShapshotContext as the backing implementation in your snapshot reading code.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/299992360/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/300022788","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/phoenix/pull/245#issuecomment-300022788","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/245","id":300022788,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMDAyMjc4OA==","user":{"login":"JamesRTaylor","id":6176299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxNzYyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6176299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesRTaylor","html_url":"https://github.com/JamesRTaylor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesRTaylor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesRTaylor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesRTaylor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesRTaylor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesRTaylor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesRTaylor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesRTaylor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesRTaylor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesRTaylor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-08T23:54:55Z","updated_at":"2017-05-08T23:54:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"FYI, @apurtell and you may want to collaborate.

The explaining string for the table part is essentially finished by these two classes, one following another. Now, the information of tablesampling is stored in `QueryPlan.Statement.fromtable` object, it resides in `BaseResultIterators`. Its parent, the abstract class `ExplainTable` will not have this info (unless we want to modify `PTable` interface and get it from `tableref`).  \r\n\r\nIn addition, table sampling main logic resides in `BaseResultIterators` when it does `getParallelScans()`. Now we are just making it to also explain the plan when it overrides `explain()`. All thing considered I think `BaseResultIterators` should be the best place to put it.
