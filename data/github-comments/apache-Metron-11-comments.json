Here is the thing that I found,  I know there is a pull about fixing IS_EMPTY from throwing exceptions - and I had to take that same return 0 approach instead of throwing.  IS_EMPTY did NOT have a test in StellarTests, so it was never being tested through the stellar variable resolver, validation, parser etc.  If it had had a test there ( using the run() as implemented in the test ) it never would have been committed, because it NEVER works, no matter what you pass it as originally implemented with the IllegalStateExceptions.  This is because the validate calls down to the apply with a specifically null argument which triggers the exception.\nSo, a couple of things:\n- every stellar function needs to be tested through the whole stellar framework and not just on top of StellarFunction.apply()\n- why would apply be called for validation?  Is that the way it is at runtime?  Does apply always get called twice?

My experience and intuition tells me that running the 'execute' and using an exception or error case as validation is not very efficient at runtime, if in fact this is what happens at runtime as well.  Better to have real metadata on the function and just validating the metadata and they syntax of the query I would think.   _A logical/runtime error does not mean an invalid expression_.  This method is in effect equating them which I think is incorrect ( unless I am mistaking the intent of validate()).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/252060401/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/252061011","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/293#issuecomment-252061011","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/293","id":252061011,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MjA2MTAxMQ==","user":{"login":"ottobackwards","id":1111551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTE1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards","html_url":"https://github.com/ottobackwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-06T19:15:12Z","updated_at":"2016-10-06T19:31:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mmiklavc I had seen that.

Thanks for the feedback. :)\n- I found a potential situation with the CSVParser wrt timestamps that would prevent users from retaining the timestamps passed in.  If you pass in a timestamp and do NOT configure the CSVParser to parse the timestamp (via the `timestampFormat` config option), then it'll overwrite your timestamp field with null, which would mean you have no ability to parse the timestamp in stellar downstream. \n\nConsider the following config:\n\n```\n {\n      \"parserClassName\" : \"org.apache.metron.parsers.csv.CSVParser\"\n     ,\"parserConfig\": {\n         \"columns\" : {\n                \"data\" : 0\n               ,\"timestamp\" : 1\n                 }\n     }\n      ,\"fieldTransformations\" : [\n          {\n           \"transformation\" : \"STELLAR\"\n          ,\"output\" : \"timestamp\"\n          ,\"config\" : {\n            \"timestamp\" : \"TO_EPOCH_TIMESTAMP(timestamp, 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss', 'UTC')\"\n                      }\n          }\n                               ]\n   }\n```\n\nwith the following data, `foo,2016-01-05 17:02:30`\nAs it stands, the CSVParser would return:\n\n```\n{\n  \"original_string\" : \"foo,2016-01-05 17:02:30\"\n  ,\"data\" : \"foo\"\n  ,\"timestamp\" : null\n```\n\nthereby dropping the timestamp field instead of passing it through if you choose to NOT have the parser manage the timestamps.\n- The benefit is that you have the choice now to do it in Stellar, but I would prefer to stay backwards compatible.  Since the CSVParser supported timestamp parsing before this PR, I left it in (and fixed a bug that would have made it impossible to pass timestamps through).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/253008646/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/253017278","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/304#issuecomment-253017278","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/304","id":253017278,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MzAxNzI3OA==","user":{"login":"ottobackwards","id":1111551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTE1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards","html_url":"https://github.com/ottobackwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-11T19:20:00Z","updated_at":"2016-10-11T19:20:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"So, for the JSONMapParser - we could remove it though?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/253017278/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/253018477","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/304#issuecomment-253018477","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/304","id":253018477,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MzAxODQ3Nw==","user":{"login":"cestella","id":540359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/540359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella","html_url":"https://github.com/cestella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-11T19:24:29Z","updated_at":"2016-10-11T19:24:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I'd prefer to keep the functionality for the CSVParser the way it is in this JIRA.

Upon closer review, I find that there is no timer thread or similar mechanism implemented in this patch.  Thus, the patch only works if there is a steady trickle of new tuples to trigger the time comparison.  But if a burst of tuples are enqueued, and then no more tuples happen for a long time, the queue will languish without flushing until another tuple triggers the time comparison, potentially much later than the desired timeout.\n@mmiklavc 's suggestion to use Tick Tuples instead is precisely the correct answer, as it avoids the considerable complexity of implementing a (robust) timer thread.\nSince this PR has been dormant since July, and the contributor has not responded to queries on the Jira, I will take over the ticket, unless a more senior member of the community wishes to do so.\nI recommend that this PR be closed without committing, and I will do the related work in the context of METRON-322, which I am also assigning to.

Unfortunately, it became apparent when it consistently failed on this PR in both travis and locally that something was happening.\n\nIt turns out the problem is [here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-metron/blob/master/metron-platform/metron-integration-test/src/main/config/zookeeper/global.json#L14).  The keen observer will notice in the global config we are ensuring that the `src_ip_addr` and `dst_ip_addr` are valid IP addresses for the integration tests.  This, of course, is a typo (that I made :P ).  The correct field names are `ip_src_addr` and `ip_dst_addr`.  \nNow, you may ask:\n- How has this ever worked?\n- Given that it did work before, why is it broken now?\n\nWell, for the first question, it was never correct in the integration tests, but since we did not exercise the situation where we send in invalid IP addresses it was not apparent.

Some of the other parsers do not create an `ip_src_addr` and `ip_dst_addr` field in their test data (e.g. `JSONMapParser`).  In those cases, the `global.json` used fails every message as invalid because the default behavior changed for the IP validation code.\n\nAs I see it, we have 2 choices:\n1. Make the behavior of the IP validator return valid if the field doesn't exist.\n2. Remove the IP validation check from the integration test global config\n3. Force the various parsers to provide those fields.\n\nI suggest 1 upon further consideration.  Global validation across ALL parsers is going to have to be tolerant of missing values as not all parsers are going to provide every fields.  I think it should be interpreted, \"Are these fields globally valid if they exist?\" rather than \"are these fields globally valid?\"\n\nThat being said, I think that the accommodation for this should exist in the FieldValidation function, not in the individual validator functions.
