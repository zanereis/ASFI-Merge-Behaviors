By looking into the current PR I think we can split it into two logical parts.\r\n\r\nThe current workflow of debugger works by running debug-runtime collect all the data we need, and then invoke a visualizer to step through the collected result.\r\n\r\nSo logically, we can draw a picture like\r\n\r\n```tvm.contrib.debugger.DebugGraphRuntime -> tvm.contrib.debugger.DebugResult(currently GraphModuleDebugDumpDatum) -> UX```\r\n\r\nLet us change this PR to only contain ```tvm.contrib.debugger.DebugGraphRuntime -> tvm.contrib.debugger.DebugResult(currently GraphModuleDebugDumpDatum) ``` and document the debug result exchange format clearly.\r\n\r\nWe can bring this in first. Once this PR get merged. The users can readily try out the debugger feature if we wrap the curse visualizer as a separate python package that you maintain. I would recommend we collect feedbacks from users and improves the curses UX, before we stablize and merge it back to master.\r\n\r\nThe tensorboard support can also be done in concurrent PRs. I recommend this path because this will force us think carefully about this separation of UX and data logging, and also ensures the high quality components, as @yzhliu and I can review the data logging components but less familar with the UX part\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/403305616/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/403305637","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/1378#issuecomment-403305637","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1378","id":403305637,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMzMwNTYzNw==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-08T18:14:40Z","updated_at":"2018-07-08T18:14:40Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@srkreddy1238 @PariksheetPinjari909 can you also please help review?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/403305637/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/403306370","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/1345#issuecomment-403306370","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1345","id":403306370,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMzMwNjM3MA==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-08T18:25:43Z","updated_at":"2018-07-08T18:25:43Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@kazum I have made some followup comments.

This can likely be resolved by adding a virtual function(GetGlobalWorkspace) and do subclassing\r\n\r\nThe second comment is that we want to optionally build sdaccel as a module, without build both when opencl is enabled.

But, here, I'm talking about filter transform for **'Wingrad'** convolution, which is totally different (it is not just reordering layout). \r\n\r\nI think kernel prepack is mainly for cpu backend. As long as you target x86, you can use 'llvm' target for precompute, and 'llvm -mcpu=skylake-avx512' for actual convolution. But Winograd filter transform is relevant for both cpu and gpu. I cannot use gpu specific winograd filter transform with 'llvm' target.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/404664656/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/404665348","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/1194#issuecomment-404665348","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1194","id":404665348,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNDY2NTM0OA==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-12T22:04:25Z","updated_at":"2018-07-12T22:04:25Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@nhynes can you act on this issue?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/404665348/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/404665550","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/1170#issuecomment-404665550","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1170","id":404665550,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNDY2NTU1MA==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-12T22:05:22Z","updated_at":"2018-07-12T22:05:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"https://tvm.ai/2018/07/12/vta-release-announcement.html #1423 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/404665550/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
