Some loose thoughts:\n- We all want to see some progress with Lucene.Net port and going to port icu4j feels like a roadblock to that initiate. I better use icu4net and make headway with the Lucene port than go onto another project port at this stage. Perhaps live with icu4net for as long as we can but keep on thinking what it will be replaced with down the road?\n- Just from taking a very raw look at the icu4j and BreakIterator for instance, it does not feel like it is a straightforward port. I could be wrong though. Also not sure if we can do that from the licensing perspective, all of their classes have comment with IBM copyright. Have no clue about those type of things (see example here: http://source.icu-project.org/repos/icu/icu4j/trunk/main/classes/core/src/com/ibm/icu/text/BreakIterator.java)\n- icu4net is not active, true, but it is just a wrapper around a very active ICU4C library. I was able to take ICU4NET, compile it, etc. So we could fork that project and create our own nuget packages and wrapper classes if we wanted to. Also that includes building 64 bit version of ICU4NET by packaging 64 bit version ICU4C libs. None of this I have experience with, so it is a bit of unknown.\n- The best part of ICU4C is that the classes it exposes, so far at least, have been a perfect match for Analysis at the API level. Porting CharArrayIterator was straightforward. I started porting SegmentingTokenizerBase in Utils just to see if I run into any issues, and again from the API perspective did not run into anything, it was straightforward to get to the point where it compiles (tests are failing, will figure out why :) ).\n\nIt just feels like for the sake of making progress ICU4NET is the way to go. It allows us to port Lucene code and then we can yank ICU4NET out once we feel like we have a good alternative for it.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nWhile you consider I am continuing to figure out what to do with ICU4NET on CI machine. It depends on init.ps1 script to be run but nuget restore has a bug where it does not do that (http://jeffhandley.com/archive/2013/12/09/nuget-package-restore-misconceptions.aspx, search for \"init.ps1\" paragraph)\n\nAnd @jpsullivan thanks for your input, appreciated. We don't have a lot of people around this so it is good to hear the opinion of others and have someone review the code, etc.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/165783222/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/165785182","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/157#issuecomment-165785182","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/157","id":165785182,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NTc4NTE4Mg==","user":{"login":"eladmarg","id":3823205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjMyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3823205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladmarg","html_url":"https://github.com/eladmarg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladmarg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladmarg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladmarg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladmarg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladmarg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladmarg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladmarg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladmarg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladmarg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-18T14:05:16Z","updated_at":"2015-12-18T14:05:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@laimis -
