Seeing whether the change makes a difference or not over time is very useful here.\r\n\r\n> I used this little program and got to 50 tries multiple times without a glitch: https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/3962#issuecomment-2371143019. I had this problem before.\r\n\r\nThat's a good thing to test, in addition to regular IDE usage over some time. If you can, please try to switch to the NetBeans version that does not have the patch, and see if the test then starts producing the bug. I remember trying that particular test myself at some point without exhibiting the bug.\r\n\r\nAnother good thing to check for is to see that and IllegalStateException is actually thrown for setContents every now and then. This is to make sure the patch actually has some effect. To see this you'd need to change the log message in the patch that currently reads \"systemClipboard#getContents ISE, attempt {0}\" to \"systemClipboard#setContents ISE, attempt {0}\", to distinguish it from the getContents case.\r\n\r\nsetContents is a mutating operation unlike getContents, so I'd be a little more cautious about doing unconditional retries, unless we know that it fixes the bug. Probably we'd want to decrease the retry count a bit; though for testing purposes it can be useful to leave it as it is in the current version of the patch.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2526389421/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2527746582","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/8026#issuecomment-2527746582","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/8026","id":2527746582,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6WqloW","user":{"login":"mbien","id":114367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien","html_url":"https://github.com/mbien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-12-09T12:11:03Z","updated_at":"2024-12-09T12:11:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"the logs in `~/.netbeans/23/var/log` might give more clues.

Gemini AI says the following about this - seems like a conflict between \"clipboard managers\" however, I have only EVER experienced this problem when using NetBeans.  Every version I have used since version 8.x has this issue:  Quite randomly, some days often, other days not a single incident, NetBeans editor will paste an older \"clip\" of text, and will no longer accept any newer (copied from internal or external application source) \"clips\".  I can paste to NotePad++, or at an external command prompt (using Windows OS, Powershell Core terminal window) no problem.  However, the attempting to paste into NetBeans fails - the pasted text is actually some older, stale \"clip\".  This has been frustrating me for YEARS, I always have to resort to closing and reopening NetBeans.  I even sometimes have to find a zombie Java/netbeans PID using task manager and kill it, to make sure Netbeans restarts properly, so that Ctrl-C/Ctrl-V copy/pasting finally works again...for a while anyway.  Another frustrating problem closely related:  Copying code (within NetBeans) to the clipboard with \"copy as RTF\" enabled, and pasting to an RTF-compatible destination editor has the same exact flaky experience.  This feature will easily stop working, and the only fix is to restart NetBeans and/or kill zombie Netbeans JVM related PIDs via task manager.  There is no combination of enabling/disabling the \"copy as RTF\" configuration/flag that will improve/break Ctrl-C/Ctrl-V copy/pasting.  They do not seem \"tethered\" as far as this buggy behavior context goes.  Just sharing to help others that find there way here via internet search results. \r\n\r\n`\r\nWhile NetBeans is a powerful IDE, it's not immune to occasional copy/paste issues. These glitches can be frustrating, but they don't happen all the time due to a combination of factors:\r\n\r\n**Robust Clipboard Handling:**\r\n\r\n* **Dedicated Clipboard Mechanism:** NetBeans has its own internal clipboard system, separate from the system clipboard. This allows it to manage copied content efficiently, reducing conflicts with other applications.\r\n* **Intelligent Paste Operations:** The IDE often analyzes the pasted content and automatically formats it to match the current context, further minimizing potential issues.\r\n\r\n**Active Development and Bug Fixes:**\r\n\r\n* **Community-Driven:** NetBeans is an open-source project with a dedicated community of developers. This means that issues, including copy/paste problems, are actively tracked and addressed through updates and bug fixes.\r\n* **Regular Updates:** The NetBeans team releases regular updates to improve stability and performance, which often includes fixes for common clipboard problems.\r\n\r\n**User-Friendly Workarounds:**\r\n\r\n* **Clearing the NetBeans Clipboard:** In some cases, clearing the NetBeans clipboard by performing an empty copy-paste operation can resolve issues.\r\n* **Using Keyboard Shortcuts:** Relying on keyboard shortcuts for copy/paste can sometimes bypass potential glitches.\r\n* **Restarting the IDE:** A simple restart can often refresh the IDE's state and resolve temporary issues.\r\n\r\n**System-Level Factors:**\r\n\r\n* **Clipboard Managers:** Some third-party clipboard managers can interfere with NetBeans' clipboard handling. Disabling or configuring these tools might help.\r\n* **Operating System-Specific Issues:** Occasionally, system-level bugs or conflicts with other software can cause copy/paste problems. Keeping your operating system up-to-date can minimize these issues.\r\n\r\n**Additional Tips:**\r\n\r\n* **Check for Updates:** Ensure you're using the latest version of NetBeans to benefit from the latest bug fixes and improvements.\r\n* **Experiment with Settings:** Try adjusting NetBeans' settings related to clipboard behavior, such as the \"Use System Clipboard\" option.\r\n* **Seek Community Support:** If you encounter persistent issues, consult the NetBeans community forums or issue trackers for specific advice and troubleshooting steps.\r\n\r\nBy understanding these factors and employing the suggested workarounds, you can significantly reduce the frequency of copy/paste problems in NetBeans and enjoy a smoother development experience.\r\n`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2539892456/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":1,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2539896999","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/7199#issuecomment-2539896999","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/7199","id":2539896999,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6XY8Cn","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-12-12T19:58:41Z","updated_at":"2024-12-12T19:58:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@DarrinWolf generated text is not welcome.
