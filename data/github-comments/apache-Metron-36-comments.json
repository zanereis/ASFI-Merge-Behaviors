To that end, I'm in general in favor of a decodable row key. I think that the question really isn't a ToC *or* a decodable rowkey.  I think, rather, we will want both.  The two will follow different access patterns.  A decodable rowkey sans ToC will be suitable only for full table scan-style access.  A ToC would enable to slice or dice by profile/entity/etc.  \r\n\r\nThat being said, a ToC without a decodable rowkey is substantially less nice.  Without being able to decode the rowkey, we will not be able to regenerate the ToC to provide alternative indexing.  I see this as a first step to enable a broader discussion on just what kind of access semantics beyond Get/Put we want to place on the profiles.\r\n\r\nAll that to say, I'm in favor of the effort.  I worry at the impact going forward to existing profiles, though.  From the point where we do this, we will create a fork whereby new profiles and old profiles diverge.  I think we need to discuss the migration story more explicitly and see if it is plausible to create a migration tool that is fuzzy (i.e. will look at the existing profiles and try to pick them apart).\r\n\r\nI'd be ok for that work to be a follow-on, but I would want the plan to be very explicit and planned out before I'd be +1 on this PR.

brought up the issue of wildcard queries on our rowkeys.  It has always bothered me that we can't do wildcard queries on groups.  If you have, for example, a single groupBy based on day of week, that's just 7 possible values, and if you want them all you could just do 7 queries and combine them.  But if you have three groupBy's, and they have 7, 31, and 256 possible values, then to simulate a wildcard query you would have to do over 55,000 individual queries!  Of course you would just do an hbase scan, but it would require a full table scan to select the time range desired.\r\n\r\nI propose that we re-order the rowkey elements to support prefix queries on Profile and time range, with wildcarding for primarily groups, and secondarily entities, ie:\r\n\\<salt\\>\\<magic\\>\\<profileHash\\>\\<period\\>\\<entity\\>\\<groups\\>\r\n\r\nSo if I want the results for all rows in a time range regarding entity \"192.168.222.123\" regardless of group, I can query it, and if I want all rows in a time range regardless of entity value or group, I can query that too, as efficiently as an ordinary time range query.

Since they are clones of external functionality, they should be kept as independent of the rest of Metron as possible, so as to ease future updates to track advances in the NiFi implementation.\r\n\r\nI recommend that you pick a _release version_ of NiFi NAR to clone.  This will (a) help give known quality, as releases are usually subjected to more testing than individual commits; (b) ease tracking bugs and patches, since formal releases are usually better documented as to what is and isn't in them, and (c) allow comparison by tag instead of commit number.\r\n* The latest released version of nifi-maven is `rel/nifi-nar-maven-plugin-1.2.0` tag, at SHA1= d0c9d46 from 14 Mar 2017.  This is the same as current master, except for a version change in preparation for the next development cycle.  So I suggest you undo (reverse-apply) patch fc124e5, to revert the version designation to the released version.  If that's still meaningful in your modified version, where I hope you've kept a record of where it came from.\r\n* The latest released version of nifi, and hence of the path nifi/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-framework-bundle/nifi-framework/nifi-nar-utils/ , is `rel/nifi-1.3.0` tag at SHA1=ddb7361 from 5 Jun 2017.  That's both the overall NiFi SHA1 commit, and the latest change on nifi-nar-utils subdirectory.  This is somewhat newer than your current reference SHA1 of d90cf84 on 24 Mar 2017.  There is a substantive change on 6 Apr, \"NIFI-3520 Refactory instance class loading\" which includes sub-task \"Refactoring nifi-nar-utils so that ExtensionManager only lives in nifi-framework\".
