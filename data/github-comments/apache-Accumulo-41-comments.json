Tablet appears to be a 'hot' lock.  I am actually looking at that class but it's a bit of a beast.  Anyway we can remove these external `Tablet` locks will make it easier later.\r\n\r\nThis class is a good candidate to improve:\r\n\r\n1. I believe the lock on `Tablet` is superfluous\r\n2. Update to use Java Concurrency classes (as an example for the rest of the code base)\r\n3. I do not trust this code because `commitsInProgress` is accessed by different threads but is not `volatile`.  In particular, it may be the case that `waitForCommitsToFinish` loops forever because the thread has cached the value of `commitsInProgress`\r\n4. `decrementCommitsInProgress` and `incrementCommitsInProgress` are not synchronized so incrementing and decrementing `commitsInProgress` seems suspect\r\n\r\nI say that the lock on `Tablet` is superfluous here because the `Tablet` is being `notifyAll()` when `commitsInProgress` is zero.  The thing is that the only code that cares about this `notifyAll()` is in `waitForCommitsToFinish`.  The `commitsInProgress` value is private to this class and only accessed in the local method `waitForCommitsToFinish`.  So, all the threads locking on `Tablet` will be awoken here, but none of them have any way to respond to this event, except for `waitForCommitsToFinish`, so why bother waking up every thread?  Just wake up the threads waiting on `commitsInProgress` to be zero.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/530824196/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/530859174","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/1358#issuecomment-530859174","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1358","id":530859174,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMDg1OTE3NA==","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-12T14:44:00Z","updated_at":"2019-09-12T14:44:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The code is very complicated for Tablet, but the conceptual model is very simple.  There is a single lock that protects most (there are some exceptions) of a tablets critical in memory data.  A single lock is very easy to reason about.  Multiple locks are hard to reason about. Adding multiple locks piecemeal w/o looking at the bigger picture is not a good idea IMO, I think a complete redesign for Tablet concurrency would be needed.\r\n\r\nThis code currently expects the Tablet lock to be held when the method is called.  Currently commit sessions are rotated on minor compaction.  The single tablet lock makes this pointer manipulation and access to an individual commit session consistent.  Without the single lock one would need to carefully ensure this consistency is maintained.  If that consistency is not maintained it would lead to many bad things.\r\n\r\nLooking into this a bit I think a nice solution for the current code would be to add the following to methods that expect the Tablet lock to be held.

Just getting the last stats could simple because those could be stored in an AtomicReference whenever they are swapped. \r\n\r\nThe current stats are trickier because another thread is changing them.  Your locking approach will make sure the current stats are visible to another thread.  I was going to propose a way to simplify the locking code using lambdas, but then I realized this was java 1.7.\r\n\r\nAnother possible approach other than the locking is to not use the thrift objects inside the GC code.  Create our own simple objects with volatile counters.  Whenever the thrift object is requested, could materialize it from the internal status object.  Not proposing to do this, its just something I thought of while thinking through the solutions space.\r\n\r\nAnother option is to do nothing.  It seems like the monitor has been reading this information without any volatile or sync.  I suppose the monitor has probably reported stale information in some circumstances.  I have seen multithreaded code that did not use volatile for a boolean read stale information for tens of minutes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/531365357/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/531372663","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1225#issuecomment-531372663","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1225","id":531372663,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMTM3MjY2Mw==","user":{"login":"milleruntime","id":11872539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODcyNTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11872539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime","html_url":"https://github.com/milleruntime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-13T20:02:35Z","updated_at":"2019-09-13T20:02:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jzgithub1

For this Accumulo needs to be better at re-building a ZK session.  Currently Accumulo will retry an invalid ZK session, instead it should try to rebuild the invalid session.

And while back-porting could be done, it is safer for the users if it is in the baseline so that they can count on it being in future releases.\r\n\r\nI understand the concern about merging this forward, but that's \"my problem\" and I'll need to work though changes that are necessary to provide the same functionality across all supported versions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/535692730/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/535772453","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/1376#issuecomment-535772453","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1376","id":535772453,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNTc3MjQ1Mw==","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-27T03:34:17Z","updated_at":"2019-09-27T03:34:17Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Until the 1.9.x branch is declared EOL\r\n\r\nBy definition (semver), 1.9 already *is* effectively EOL, with respect to new features (at least, those in the public API). While technically your changes don't affect the public API, and are therefore not violations of the semver rules we've agreed to, they do violate the *spirit* of it by introducing behavioral changes that aren't forwards-compatible and by changing user-facing elements, such as the configuration for things other than to fix a bug. In my personal opinion, maintenance releases should be minimal changes that provide for increasingly stable and less buggy versions of a previous \".0\" release that are as fully forwards-compatible and have as few user-facing changes as possible. We haven't always been good about this; we should strive to be better.\r\n\r\n> Because of the jump between 1.9.x and 2.x that is required by users, there are going to be people using the 1.9.x line for a while.\r\n\r\nThat's precisely why we should focus on increasingly stable maintenance releases, and not potentially create new problems for 1.9 users. Semver means: upgrade to major/minor for new features, upgrade to maintenance release for increasingly stable with the existing feature set. That's the trade-off. It's intentional. The more we blur those lines, the worse it is for users, trying to reason about risk and reward for upgrading to a particular version.\r\n\r\n> Maybe a solution is these types of changes go into a 1.10 release?\r\n\r\nThat is the right way to do new features in the world of semver. However, I'm not sure how I feel about supporting an additional release line right now. And I have no idea what that might mean for the LTS idea that was raised, or for our ability to continue to support those on 1.9 with maintenance releases, or work on 2.x. That should be discussed on the mailing list.\r\n\r\n****\r\n\r\nI do get that you're trying to target your contributions in a way that will see the light of day faster, and that you're putting in the work to support the older version, but I think there's very good reason to add them to the next development version, rather than try to put them in maintenance releases. Putting them in the next development version, rather than a maintenance branch, gives new features more time to be exercised, inspected, tested, checked for alignment with current development direction, and reviewed for correctness, prior to release. It keeps the next version moving forward, and helps releases get out the door faster than they would if we are constantly dealing with merge conflicts, and code reviews across many branches. And, it helps ensure that users can predict the level of risk associated with upgrading to a maintenance release, by providing increasingly stable maintenance releases without the complications or behavior changes associated with new features, and it ensures greater forwards-compatibility. I just don't see the urgency of forcing new features into older branches, rather than targeting them for the next stable version under development. I think it creates more work and has too many downsides.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/535772453/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/536039331","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1375#issuecomment-536039331","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1375","id":536039331,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNjAzOTMzMQ==","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-27T17:58:22Z","updated_at":"2019-09-27T17:58:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Its a hack and I am not sure if it would work.

This puts more responsibility on users, but is easier for us to maintain while satisfying user expectations (because expectations are explicit in each scan, from a table config which may not be consistent across a cluster and could be in flux). Certainly, at this point, I'd prefer people use scan-time iterators rather than table-configured iterators, and I think I feel the same way for other configs, such as execution hints. That said, I think it might make sense to have something like `table.scan.defaults.execution-hints`, and other `table.scan.defaults.*` properties for scans which don't set these options explicitly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/544613433/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/545123753","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1388#issuecomment-545123753","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1388","id":545123753,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NTEyMzc1Mw==","user":{"login":"milleruntime","id":11872539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODcyNTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11872539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime","html_url":"https://github.com/milleruntime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-22T19:48:02Z","updated_at":"2019-10-22T19:48:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This is related and could assist in #1390 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/545123753/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/545667031","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/1391#issuecomment-545667031","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1391","id":545667031,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NTY2NzAzMQ==","user":{"login":"EdColeman","id":7047700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDc3MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7047700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman","html_url":"https://github.com/EdColeman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-23T22:44:29Z","updated_at":"2019-10-23T22:44:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Intend to work on testing -
