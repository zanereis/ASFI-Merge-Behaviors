I found an easy workaround for lack of ARG support in 'COPY --from'. This way we have now 3 images less and 3 dockerfiles less. It started to look manageable and reasonable.\r\n\r\n* We have now those images (per python version):\r\n   * Basic Airflow apt dependencies: [**_airflow/latest-2.7-deps-v2.0.0.dev0_**]\r\n   * Airflow image = Basic Airflow apt dependencies + PIP packages installed + airflow installed [**_airflow/latest-2.7_**, **_airflow/latest-2.7-v2.0.0.dev0_**] - this is what we currently build \r\n\r\n   * CI apt dependencies = Basic Airflow apt dependencies + those needed for CI [**_latest-3.7-ci-deps-v2.0.0.dev0_**]\r\n   * CI PIPCACHE image = CI apt Dependencies + compiled wheels for all packages [**_latest-2.7-pipcache-v2.0.0.dev0_**]\r\n   * CI image = CI apt dependencies + /cache from PIPCACHE + PIP packages installed from the cached  wheels + airflow installed [**_latest-2.7-ci_**, **_latest-2.7-ci-v2.0.0.dev0_**] \r\n\r\nThis starts looking much easier to explain ( I will draw some DAG with dependencies when it comes to documentation). So this might be the final setup.  \r\n\r\n* I added back NPM - it is now using 'apt ci' instead of 'apt install' (it uses package-lock.json instead of updating it). It is also added now with incremental layering architecture - it will only be run when any of the www sources change rather than any other sources.

Since I do not understand why this is the case, I decided that setting the malformed schema option was safer in that the name of the option implies that schema checking is being turned off. \r\n\r\nRegardless, the result of both end up being the same, so I would have been ok with either.

And i did the \"refactor\" phase already. I managed to work out a way of putting all the Docker code into single Dockerfile. It's now quite big file but it's nicely, logically separated and uses multi-staging of Dockerfiles a lot! \r\n\r\nI finally learned how to use multi-staging properly :D - something that I wanted to do for a long time. \r\n\r\nThis is really nice I think and looks pretty manageable long term. This is what we will have now:\r\n\r\n* Anyone can get airflow image by just running `docker build .`. No magic scripts involved :). It will build airflow image - equivalent to what we had before (and of similar size) but multi-layered. It will not be as cache-efficient as other methods (it will only use local cache from your previous local builds). You can use it to build airflow from the scratch without depending on our airflow/* images from DockerHub.\r\n\r\n* You can run ./local_docker_build.sh. This will make proper \"cached\" build - it will automatically pull images from DockerHub so that you do not have wait for all the dependencies to be installed and it will use those as cache as much as possible (i.e. if setup.py did not change, it will only add sources etc.). One nice thing with this local_docker_build.sh is that it will use wheel cache (similarly as CI image) so even if dependencies change, they will be reinstalled very quickly when you build it.\r\n\r\n* On CI (Travis) also runs the ./local_docker_build.sh to prepare image for testing. By default it will skip building main airflow image and wheel cache. It will only build CI image (which contains more dependencies and uses wheel cache to perform fast rebuilds). This way we save time on Travis to prepare image for tests. Also (for now) I configured the build to not reinstall PIP dependencies when setup.py does not change for CI builds. This way we can get what I was talking about for a long time - stable set of pip-installed dependencies on Travis (it will be refreshed automatically every time setup.py changes). This means that the dreadful transient dependency changes will only become a problem when someone changes setup.py.\r\n\r\n* the smaller (no wheel cache) main Airflow image (Also CI + wheels + dependencies) will be rebuild on DockerHub from master after merge and pushed there. It will be also efficiently using caced images from previous DockerHub build (following the multi-layer architecture). This way DockerHub builds will eventually catch-up with latest master-commits and what you will get in DockerHub will be eventually freshest version (this way we can also check if latest set of dependencies can be installed). This way we can immediately detect if there are some transient dependency problems and fix it, but at the same time it will not impact CI builds using latest cached image.\r\n\r\n* We can also setup a separate build which uses NO DOCKER CACHE whatsoever (by simply setting variable AIRFLOW_CONTAINER_USE_DOCKER_CACHE to false). It will then build everything from the scratch. This could be our safety-net to catch any case where any of the transient dependencies causes a problem which is hidden by caching.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/471200981/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/471202908","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4885#issuecomment-471202908","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4885","id":471202908,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MTIwMjkwOA==","user":{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-09T17:23:31Z","updated_at":"2019-03-09T17:23:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks

I was also thinking about it. \r\n\r\nThere are two possible aproaches I thought about:\r\n\r\n1) Keep what I proposed - right now the requirements will be \"frozen\" implicitly for CI builds. We can  have a separate \"clean\" build where everything will install from scratch. We have now full support for it and we could setup a separate Travis build just doing it (not running tests, just running build afresh from a master branch notifying everyone. That would be like a global (\"the requirements we have now in master are unstable and we need to fix them really soon\" warning). I like this idea as it would not impact the people who just commit few line fixes but then maintainers could have enough lead time to fix it. Hovever it is not in line with the \"explicit is better than implicit\" Zen of python.\r\n\r\n2) Another option is something akin to NPM .lock file. We could run something like `pip freeze > ci-requirements.txt` and save it in the repo (equivalent to npm's .lock file). This could be run  \r\nat every 'pip install -e .' (custom install class in setup.py) - but then we would have to freeze those requirements with \"ci_devel\" extras. \r\n\r\nI think this kind of worklfow as described in 2) was one of the main motivations of why in NPM they changed 'npm install' behaviour (and somehow explains why 'npm ci' is hard to discover/not obvious). With 'npm install' anyone running it will now get the \".lock\" file updated and will be encouraged to commit it together with package.json change. If we write custom setup.py Install method, that could actually work the same way - ci-requirements.txt will get updated and we can use those requirements rather than setup.py to install requirements for CI builds (with pip install -r). With the multi-layered Dockerfile I have now it should be quite easy to do this conditionally only for CI builds .\r\n\r\nI start to like the 2)nd approach more and more as I think about it :). It's explicit and might actually work. \r\n\r\nWhat do you think @ashb ?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/471218351/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/471220632","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4886#issuecomment-471220632","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4886","id":471220632,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MTIyMDYzMg==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-09T20:48:49Z","updated_at":"2019-03-09T22:32:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/4886?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#4886](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/4886?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/commit/49ade3834a46d9a12c0339a017d1807bf021c5e3?src=pr&el=desc) will **not change** coverage.\n> The diff coverage is `100%`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/4886/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&token=WdLKlKHOAU&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/4886?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@           Coverage Diff           @@\n##           master    #4886   +/-   ##\n=======================================\n  Coverage   75.28%   75.28%           \n=======================================\n  Files         450      450           \n  Lines       29021    29021           \n=======================================\n  Hits        21849    21849           \n  Misses       7172     7172\n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/4886?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [airflow/utils/tests.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/4886/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy91dGlscy90ZXN0cy5weQ==) | `53.84% <100%> (ø)` | :arrow_up: |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/4886?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/4886?src=pr&el=footer).

First, further changes may occur, because we're working on the documentation structure all the time (ex. https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4894). They only expand the scope of documentation. If the current documentation is sufficient, future versions also. Secondly, this change can not be accepted, because commiter is on vacation. There is only one person who can accept these changes. If he comes back from holidays, we will pass him other changes that were made first.\r\n\r\nI hope to understand and accept our way of working.
