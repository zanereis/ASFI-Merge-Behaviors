personal worst-case is developing for liferay-portal. It uses a custom patched gradle version and requires JDK 8 to build. This seems to improve the situation a lot! This is not yet a comprehensive test, but this is what I did:\r\n\r\nI build NetBeans from this branch. Additionally I had to adjust the gradle deamon settings like this (`~/.gradle/gradle.properties`):\r\n\r\n```properties\r\norg.gradle.jvmargs=-Xms512m -Xmx4g\r\nliferay.home=/home/matthias/src/liferay-portal/bundles/\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first option give the gradle daemon enough space to handle the projects and the second is needed as the liferay build system sets this property from the ant invocation that starts the build. I have to restructure the build minimally, so that the grade wrapper is found. I build liferay once using `ant all`, then I copy the `gradle` directory from the main directory to `modules`. In the ` modules/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`  I change the `distributionUrl` to `distributionUrl=../../../tools/gradle-6.9.2-LIFERAY-PATCHED1-bin.zip`. Finally the patched gradle needs to be renamed to fit the gradle versioning scheme from ` gradle-6.9.2.LIFERAY-PATCHED-1-bin.zip` to `gradle-6.9.2-LIFERAY-PATCHED1-bin.zip` .\r\n\r\nProject loading takes time, but it feels nice to be able to open the projects in a sane manner.

Code has to be readable without them. Wanting to see the type of a `var` indicates that this probably should not be a `var` - swapping `var` with the type can sometimes even be more compact than letting the IDE draw the type next to `var`. Enabling those kind of hints by default is risky since it could influence how new devs write new code and lead to more var-overuse - if you see the type anyway, why not use `var` literally everywhere. The parameter hints have a similar issue (but this has smaller impact IMO) since they could influence formatting.\r\n\r\nSo how should an IDE make (somewhat) badly written code more readable without influencing how new code is written? I am not sure.\r\n\r\n(one thought: if you really want to see the type of a `var` to understand the code better, why not draw the type _instead_ of `var` with some kind of toggle button. This would be a pure readability aid and would not make sense to have always on while you write code. There is also the `ctrl+p `option to render param types on methods - what if this would appear by default if the cursor is over the method name (same could be done for var)? Maybe the answer to all this is to have some buttons in the editor toolbar to quickly toggle the setting on or off on demand instead of global options you set once?)\r\n\r\n\r\nBut more options is a good start +1 from me - good job Matthias. I wouldn't say no to having them on by default - I just would prefer not to due to the reasons given.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1328321040/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1328924731","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/4314#issuecomment-1328924731","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4314","id":1328924731,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5PNcg7","user":{"login":"tbw777","id":15821889,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODIxODg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15821889?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbw777","html_url":"https://github.com/tbw777","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbw777/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbw777/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbw777/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbw777/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbw777/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbw777/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbw777/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbw777/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbw777/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-28T11:30:19Z","updated_at":"2022-11-28T11:33:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":">

It's not that easy. From my experience, my guess would be that you WILL NOT be able to reproduce it regardless. Why? Because I was not able to reproduce it when I removed files, made the project smaller and so on. I have a lot of experience with making test cases. I will give you the POM so you can inspect it. But I would appreciate if you could look at the stack trace to see what that compiler is complaining about. Perhaps you can give me a logging configuration so you can drill deeper. We need to assume that my environment is the one that we need to use to pinpoint the problem. Whatever it takes. I will also attach a log file from a fresh IDE 16 install.
