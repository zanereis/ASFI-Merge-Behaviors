Workers have the number of execution slots you define and when they receive a message to run a task instance they proceed to do so.\n\nIf you add new workers, they start listening to the queue and will take on processing task instances as well. At Airbnb we currently have 6 workers with 128 slots on each, meaning we can process up to 768 task instances in parallel. If you have deployment automation like we do, you can kick off more workers and get more slots by clicking a few buttons.\n\nSince most of these tasks are just sensors of Hive jobs, the workers don't do much work, that's why we're able to provision 128 slots on machine that have 8 vCPUs without worrying about saturating those machines. Each worker could probably have twice as much slots and we'd be fine. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/113359864/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/113438105","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/46#issuecomment-113438105","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/46","id":113438105,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExMzQzODEwNQ==","user":{"login":"martingrayson","id":870417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MDQxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/870417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martingrayson","html_url":"https://github.com/martingrayson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martingrayson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martingrayson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martingrayson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martingrayson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martingrayson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martingrayson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martingrayson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martingrayson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martingrayson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-19T08:58:32Z","updated_at":"2015-06-19T08:58:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I've also noticed this - it doesn't feel right keep shutting the webserver down and starting it during development.

You can refresh individual dag by clicking the refresh icon on the DAGs page. So in a production setup new dags do get discovered properly and it works with as many servers as you have running (each one of our workers runs the web server as well).\n\nWe used to have an endpoint that would tell the web server to refresh its DagBag, and do it in the scope of a web request but moved away from that as we started running muli-threaded / multiple web servers as hitting the endpoint would only refresh one thread randomly. It's a much more complicated problem when you have lots of DagBags to keep in sync. A temporary solution is to expire the DagBag and force it to refresh periodically on the web server. I could also add a hidden endpoint that you'd hit when developing to refresh the DagBag without restarting the web server.\n\nThe longer term solution is to have 100% stateless web servers that load DAGs from the pickles (serialized DAGs) from the database. The reason why this is not 100% working at this time is that jinja templates aren't serializable and I haven't found a hack to serialize them

The Celery **broker** (most likely RabbitMQ or Redis) is a piece of infrastructure that is required and someone needs to keep up and running. Redis is fairly common nowaways and a breeze to setup, at Airbnb we already had both systems running in production and in-house knowledge about them.\n\nBut note that Celery supports using a database (through SqlAlchemy) as a broker, which you already should have setup. So using your same SqlAlchemy connection as a broker seems pretty reasonable to me, even though it is \"experimental\" as far as Celery support. \n\nThe thing is Celery is an async framework that can operate at web scale (a common use case is to process thumbnails for uploaded images outside the scope of a web request), and is setup to handle dozens, if not thousands of messages per **second**. A database might have some troubles with that many messages, plus the workers constantly poking at it. But with Airflow, the number of messages you'd send is probably in the few hundreds, or thousands a **day**, so using Celery as a broker might be very reasonable, especially in a pre-production-type setup.\n\nAs far as getting a proper Celery setup going, people should refer to the Celery docs. I just added a reference in the docs here:\nhttps://github.com/airbnb/airflow/commit/65c5f0ae29770ced643b11b85243b27fbeca90e5\n\nBoth hey, it'd be nice the best of both worlds in terms of \"get going quickly\" and \"scale to infinity\", but the later one has to require some infrastructure.\n\nFor the record, when RabbitMQ was having some problems (unrelated to Airflow), I setup a survival Redis box and migrated in about 20 minutes. Of course productionizing Redis, setting up a slave and monitoring it is more workload, but you can do all of this once Airflow becomes an important part of your ecosystem. This should be somewhat trivial for ops folks or data-infra people: that should be part of their job description to provide the services you need to do your work. I respect trying to keep the ecosystem simple though!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/113785686/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/113786884","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/52#issuecomment-113786884","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/52","id":113786884,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExMzc4Njg4NA==","user":{"login":"r39132","id":581734,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MTczNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/581734?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132","html_url":"https://github.com/r39132","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-20T16:09:29Z","updated_at":"2015-06-21T01:01:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It does make sense for use with Celery, but that is a different use-case than what I have in mind.\n\nOur data pipeline uses SQS : [Agari's Data Pipeline](http://agari.com/blog/leveraging-aws-build-scalable-data-pipeline) \n\nWe use SNS+SQS actually - we publish S3 object-created notifications over SNS+SQS. SNS has push-based topics with 0 day message retention and SQS has pull-based queues with max 14 day message retention. When we publish to SNS, SNS pushes to multiple SQS queues. We have several data importers that load this data into different DBs. \n\nSo, as  part of my data pipeline, I would like to detect that a queue receives a message (it signals that it is receiving data).

In addition to supporting the broker infrastructure for celery, I also need to run a separate \"airflow worker\" and make sure it is fault-tolerant (e.g. monit, etc...). It would have been nice if a worker started in the main \"airflow webserver\", but I don't see any queue consumers running when I run \"airflow webserver\".\n\nFinally, I'm not clear why running the LocalExecutor (if I don't have more than 3 flows running) is a bad idea. But, I would like to have the UI features work and I would like to have the dags imported into the DB, not just showing up on the UI. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/114300918/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/114301066","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/65#issuecomment-114301066","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/65","id":114301066,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNDMwMTA2Ng==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-22T23:24:19Z","updated_at":"2015-06-22T23:24:19Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"![img](http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/bpg.gif)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/114301066/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/114301325","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/62#issuecomment-114301325","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/62","id":114301325,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNDMwMTMyNQ==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-22T23:25:56Z","updated_at":"2015-06-22T23:25:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Awesome!
