you for taking a look @exceptionfactory. I know this is a large change in terms of lines changes, so I really appreciate that.\r\n\r\nWhile going through the interface declaration, I noticed that those functions are just a shorthand overload of their respective functions with more parameters.\r\n\r\nThe behaviour of calling `commitAsync()` is defined equal to calling `commitAsync(Runnable onSuccess, Consumer<Throwable> onFailure)` with both parameters set to `null`, as both parameters are optional. In fact, the same applies to the \"sibling\" method `commitAsync(Runnable onSuccess)`  which has an existing default implementation of `commitAsync(onSuccess, null);`. I figured adding a default for `commitAsync()` would further align both function overloads.\r\n\r\nA similar reasoning can be applied to `merge(Collection<FlowFile> sources, FlowFile destination)` who's behavior is defined akin to that of `merge(Collection<FlowFile> sources, FlowFile destination, byte[] header, byte[] footer, byte[] demarcator)` when passing `null` for all of `header`, `footer`, and `demarcator`. However, this time there is no other sibling overload with a default.\r\n\r\nAs adding a default implementation is not a breaking change nor alters the behavior for any existing implementation I figured that's a sensible addition. However, you're right that it's out of scope of the original issue description.\r\nWith this background, what are your thoughts on this? Should I revert the addition of those default implementations or do you follow the reasoning above?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2048209586/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2050053994","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/8620#issuecomment-2050053994","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/8620","id":2050053994,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM56MVdq","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-11T16:16:10Z","updated_at":"2024-04-11T16:16:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the helpful reply @EndzeitBegins.\r\n\r\nI evaluated the current method implementations that align with the proposed default implementations, and it seems like introducing the new default implementation methods could be helpful.

Problem is that we've seen users using PutIceberg without any kind of Merge operation before (imagine ConsumeKafka (not record based) to PutIceberg) creating thousands of small (hundreds of bytes) files and associated snapshots. This has basically killed the performances and made the query engine on top of the Iceberg tables pretty much unusable. While I do agree that the approach with a specific property sets a precedent that is not great, I don't really see another good approach to make sure the flow designer is aware of this as soon as the designer tries to run the processor to make some tests. I definitely don't think we should go in the direction of adding the Merge capabilities into the processor itself (that is going to be a mess and extremely complicated). The rules engine would be great but you can't be sure that the rule would be set and enforced by users before someone starts designing a flow where Iceberg is a destination. The reason for this change in this case is really because creating so many snapshot files has basically killed the downstream system.\r\n\r\nAnother approach that I can think of: if the processor is processing a flow file that is below the agreed size, then we would yield the processor, and the default yield duration would be set to something like 1 minute.

The usual convention is to have multiple instances of the processor for each top-level resource (i.e. database connection).\r\n\r\nHaving said that, if we want to leverage ControllerServiceLookups to allow a single instance to perform more diverse \"work\", we may want to look at another set of processors that better support swapping out controller services based on attribute values.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2070055327/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2070333872","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/8677#issuecomment-2070333872","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/8677","id":2070333872,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM57Zsmw","user":{"login":"joewitt","id":3057465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTc0NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3057465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt","html_url":"https://github.com/joewitt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-22T17:26:26Z","updated_at":"2024-04-22T17:26:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Squashed

In light mode the bulletin icon for the canvas and for processors (and most likely other components) looks good. They use the `warn-color-darker` background with a white color for the icon. However, in dark mode it seems this is not respected and `red` is used as the background and the icon color is white for the canvas but black for the processor. <img alt=\"Screenshot 2024-04-23 at 8 24 05 AM\" width=\"1151\" src=\"https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/713866/324832248-e07d9da9-8a73-4cbe-ac46-2b668a72e6eb.png?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJnaXRodWIuY29tIiwiYXVkIjoicmF3LmdpdGh1YnVzZXJjb250ZW50LmNvbSIsImtleSI6ImtleTUiLCJleHAiOjE3MTM4ODA3ODMsIm5iZiI6MTcxMzg4MDQ4MywicGF0aCI6Ii83MTM4NjYvMzI0ODMyMjQ4LWUwN2Q5ZGE5LThhNzMtNGNiZS1hYzQ2LTJiNjY4YTcyZTZlYi5wbmc_WC1BbXotQWxnb3JpdGhtPUFXUzQtSE1BQy1TSEEyNTYmWC1BbXotQ3JlZGVudGlhbD1BS0lBVkNPRFlMU0E1M1BRSzRaQSUyRjIwMjQwNDIzJTJGdXMtZWFzdC0xJTJGczMlMkZhd3M0X3JlcXVlc3QmWC1BbXotRGF0ZT0yMDI0MDQyM1QxMzU0NDNaJlgtQW16LUV4cGlyZXM9MzAwJlgtQW16LVNpZ25hdHVyZT04NTVkYmIzNjc3ZDFjODc0ZDM4YjMyZGM1NWVjMmZkNTQzMWU3MzMzYzZhZWQxZWFhMTE1ZTc5MjVjZDU1ZjhmJlgtQW16LVNpZ25lZEhlYWRlcnM9aG9zdCZhY3Rvcl9pZD0wJmtleV9pZD0wJnJlcG9faWQ9MCJ9.zmjgnsRKg0HF2Pv29dp70i9RTJ5PDuMu_MQ-FGSKNz4\"> <img alt=\"Screenshot 2024-04-23 at 8 23 52 AM\" width=\"1157\" src=\"https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/713866/324832281-ebc42446-cc7f-46d8-96c1-caaf53722a9d.png?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJnaXRodWIuY29tIiwiYXVkIjoicmF3LmdpdGh1YnVzZXJjb250ZW50LmNvbSIsImtleSI6ImtleTUiLCJleHAiOjE3MTM4ODA3ODMsIm5iZiI6MTcxMzg4MDQ4MywicGF0aCI6Ii83MTM4NjYvMzI0ODMyMjgxLWViYzQyNDQ2LWNjN2YtNDZkOC05NmMxLWNhYWY1MzcyMmE5ZC5wbmc_WC1BbXotQWxnb3JpdGhtPUFXUzQtSE1BQy1TSEEyNTYmWC1BbXotQ3JlZGVudGlhbD1BS0lBVkNPRFlMU0E1M1BRSzRaQSUyRjIwMjQwNDIzJTJGdXMtZWFzdC0xJTJGczMlMkZhd3M0X3JlcXVlc3QmWC1BbXotRGF0ZT0yMDI0MDQyM1QxMzU0NDNaJlgtQW16LUV4cGlyZXM9MzAwJlgtQW16LVNpZ25hdHVyZT03Mjc5YzUwODFmNTg4NzA1OGE5NDMyNDQ5Yjk3Nzk1ZGM0MWRlZjBhMmRlNTVhNmY3MmFlYzQzYTFhYmRmYzk1JlgtQW16LVNpZ25lZEhlYWRlcnM9aG9zdCZhY3Rvcl9pZD0wJmtleV9pZD0wJnJlcG9faWQ9MCJ9.K86DCONJq_KrIj-eWosVGbRuvHVFkEC4Yai_bqVowvw\">\r\n> \r\n\r\nGood catch!
