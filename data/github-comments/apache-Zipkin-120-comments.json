So that way my PR for OTLP ingress can be dropped unless we want it to be there for Zipkin 2.\r\n\r\nI think since we will not want to switch too quickly from marking v2 deprecated and v3 stable, it still makes sense to add this PR to v2.

Internals will be quite new but user facing API's will remain the same.\r\n\r\nThe key thing to understand is that when upgrading from v2 to v3 you will not be able to automatically migrate your tracing data as the storage data schemas are not the same. Unless someone volunteers we have no plans to do schema migrations for any of the storage modules. Since Zipkin data typically has a short retention span we expect site owners to keep the old Zipkin deployment active until all data is purged in case they must keep the data during the retention period.

Because, the TTL of spans is short, such as days. In some cases, the data would lost the value before the immigration is done.\r\n\r\nThe reason for different schema designs in SkyWalking, is from what we learned from large-scale deployment. As SkyWalking agent + OAP usually work for 100% sampling. We created more concepts to help query(including SkyWalking UI and Lens UI) to have better responses.\r\nAs JC said, this is not unchangeable. We haven't began to gather feedback as currently, we are only working on this branch rather than main branch, and finish the first preview version, which makes everything work.\r\n\r\n> If not, I still wonder, what will Zipkin v3 offer over switching to Skywalker for Zipkin users? I think it could be helpful to have a bullet list for that.\r\n\r\nThis PR is the value. SkyWalking as an APM is impossible to work with Cassandra successfully, but Zipkin server can.\r\nAnother thing like GraalVM support. SkyWalking OAP would have a long way(one year, even longer) to support GraalVM. But here as Zipkin v3, this should be able to support soon. OAP has many analysis relative things, which is hard to immigrate to run on GraalVM.\r\n\r\nOne of the key point is Zipkin VS SkyWalking OAP is that, OAP is too complex for Zipkin users. It support all cases for an observability team, but Zipkin v3 could be much lighter, more stable and focus on tracing relative things. Meanwhile, we could share the experiences on both sides.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/1751638959/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/1751655188","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/3570#issuecomment-1751655188","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/3570","id":1751655188,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAEXUMc5oaCMU","user":{"login":"anuraaga","id":198344,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5ODM0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/198344?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga","html_url":"https://github.com/anuraaga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-07T08:51:57Z","updated_at":"2023-10-07T08:51:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> write to the two servers and progressively start moving to use new server.\n\nYeah I assume that new server for new data, old server for old until deletion will be the practical approach vs trying any migration scripts.\n\nSo I'm still wondering why is this Zipkin?

We have a lack of maintenance issue that's likely not made easier with alpine. We also have a lack of transparency on CVE prioritization ( no trivy), and maybe need better guidance on alternatives (roll your own image which you control CVEs on) and how to get help (look at the normal docker-alpine image). If no one has focus for these tasks, they become sporadic and CVE issues are only one type of problem inherent in that situation. Whether we keep or drop alpine, most problems are the same, iotw. We need to open an issue to get stakeful maintainers and routine releases again.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIn this issue description, I used the word conjecture when discussing two problem areas. Both points I conjected as a root cause of maintenance issues.. I didn't know that to be the case. I'm beginning to believe lack of maintenance is a vicious cycle, as people can easily become unfamiliar with the parts. If releases were routine and always updated to latest everything.. and change merged quickly as it once was, things wouldn't be pressing as they are now. Basically, it goes right back to site-owner involvement or routine dedicated curation, even if only once a month. Blaming things on alpine distracts from this real root issue.\r\n\r\nI'll discuss the alpine topic to illustrate this. Right now, this image is not re-cut when alpine versions are. Instead, it is done sporadically, mostly thanks to duty of @llinder. If we used a different image and didn't update frequently, we would also have CVEs bubble up, CVE isn't about alpine, though there's certainly a case about lack of familiarity both with the image and also with how to know if a workaround is in progress.\r\n\r\nCase in point https://github.com/openzipkin/docker-alpine/pull/34 about CVE-2023-2975. This was not transparently detected, rather by a trivy setup internal to my company. That's problem one: we should be transparent about things like this, and the whole thing is even more important as my company isn't monitoring zipkin anymore! So, there really should be trivy setup and if not, it doesn't matter what base layer you use, there's a chance of CVE going unnoticed.\r\n\r\nNow, onto the specific CVE, which I can tell was quite annoying. I'll assume we had to fix it, but in truth that's questionable to do out of band, as we intentionally keep our java executable straightforward due to prior work with Tyro bank. A lot of places flat out will not depend on a image outside their control for reasons exactly like this.. anyway back to the point. In this case the issue was trying to fix something *between alpine versions*, which is why it was annoying. Whoever felt this was urgent would be amiss without the following info.. alpine has a docker-alpine image. So, they tracked the [same issue](https://github.com/alpinelinux/docker-alpine/issues/333) and resolved it in a formal alpine release 5 days after we made a workaround! I didn't look, but it is likely our zipkin image wasn't redone until roughly then anyway. In other words, I think with better docs on the base layer about where to look for CVE help (upstream) and setting up trivy (to know what problems are) things would be better. However, this only matters if someone routinely turns cranks and can work with sites to prioritize CVEs. A prioritization could have eliminated some urgency and annoyance, iotw. This sort of devops leadership is a job that needs to be filled, and if it results in routine releases, CVEs will be back to non-issues as they once were, as every time we did a release, and it was frequent, all deps of all kinds are updated or documented why not.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/1837006358/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/1837054940","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/3607#issuecomment-1837054940","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/3607","id":1837054940,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAEXUMc5tfzvc","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-02T06:05:33Z","updated_at":"2023-12-02T06:05:33Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"draft

If we did, it would need to be proven out as a third party add on, and this project healthy, way before we do. At this point, none are true. No offense, but this needs to be moved to a separate repo, at least to begin with. The skywalking approach could also be moved to a separate repo. In any case, this won't land here in the near future.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHi, marcin. long time no see. A long time ago, we spent a lot of effort to modularize non-core functionality, due to maintenance burden and deps. We evaluated a lot of options and went with spring for modularity and used that in a few areas, like [zipkin-gcp](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-gcp). I think with the current state of maintenance, adding something with a lot of dependencies and an externally defined data format isn't a good idea now, even more so than before. We need to get more site-owners involved, and we have been neglecting their PRs, even to fix ES or armeria. We have to fix things like this before adding features.\r\n\r\nHere is the rationale about modules, which was made after evaluating a lot of things several years ago\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/blob/f75bf0fdad10db2616b10e237c9fbe827bf408a0/zipkin-server/RATIONALE.md?plain=1#L7\r\n\r\nHere are several optional modules, which also can be added to the default server without causing maintenance here.
