The DataStream API JavaDocs mention that one can aggregate on expressions including Java Bean-like getters which is not true regardless of this change. [1]\n2. I think this is due to the confusion between the `KeySelectors` produced by the `Keys.ExpressionKeys` and the String expressions that we can pass to an aggregation operator. E.g. one of the distinctions between the two options are that the former can return a `CompositeType`, while we forbid that to happen in the case of the latter as that could cause the aggregation itself to fail.\n3. The batch API aggregations do not have the overloaded version where you could pass a field accessor string. Of course this is just a convenience method anyway, which is easily implemented on the user side, e.g. as it is done in the `WordCountPojo` example. [2]\n\nAs for this pull request I suggest to update the false Javadoc from the streaming API and document in the concepts that the aggregation field accessors and the keyselectors are slightly different due to there semantics.\n\nOther than this observation I like the changes and would like to have them in by the end of next week.\n\n[1] https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/b8299bf92d8e3dbe140dd89602699394019b783d/flink-streaming-java/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/streaming/api/datastream/KeyedStream.java#L295-L310\n[2] https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/b8299bf92d8e3dbe140dd89602699394019b783d/flink-examples/flink-examples-batch/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/examples/java/wordcount/WordCountPojo.java#L106-L111\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/246979912/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/247235705","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2275#issuecomment-247235705","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2275","id":247235705,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NzIzNTcwNQ==","user":{"login":"vijikarthi","id":5560671,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NjA2NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5560671?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijikarthi","html_url":"https://github.com/vijikarthi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijikarthi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijikarthi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijikarthi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijikarthi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijikarthi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijikarthi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijikarthi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijikarthi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijikarthi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-15T05:04:26Z","updated_at":"2016-09-15T05:04:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@nielsbasjes Thanks for the link.

I have fixed the issue by adding a dummy configuration file that will be used only to set the system property when SASL authentication is enabled (Apparently both Kafka and ZK rely on the configuration property and I believe they are moving away from using these variables, but for now we need the hack for secure deployment).

Now the aggregations should accept any field expression that selects a single field and would be a valid key selector, and some more (selecting array elements).\n\nAs for documenting that the aggregations don't work on a field that is still some composite type, I'm not sure if this is necessary, since this should be pretty obvious to the user.\n\n> The batch API aggregations do not have the overloaded version where you could pass a field accessor string.\n\nHere is the Jira for this: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-4575\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/247348881/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/247365019","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2485#issuecomment-247365019","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2485","id":247365019,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NzM2NTAxOQ==","user":{"login":"twalthr","id":5746567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDY1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5746567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr","html_url":"https://github.com/twalthr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-15T15:39:47Z","updated_at":"2016-09-15T15:39:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @chobeat.

Just a few words to @nielsbasjes who reported the issue. I've tested the fix using the test instructions you provided. Even before this fix, I could get rid of the temp files by forcing a manual garbage collection on the JVM, using `jcmd <pid> GC.run`. However, that only worked once the job meta data had been removed from the archive, i.e. it doesn't show up in the web interface anymore. With this fix, the class loader is cleared upon job completion and the files are immediately removed. `lsof | fgrep blob_` didn't show any of these files anymore.\n\nNote, that we don't perform any cleanup on the TaskManager side. There we also wind up with some left over files but they don't seem to pile up. It must be that the garbage collector can figure out when to clean much earlier. Plus, we don't keep a reference to old Task instances like we do for the web interface on the JobManager side.\n\n@StephanEwen I'm thinking about adding a similar fix for the TaskManager side.
