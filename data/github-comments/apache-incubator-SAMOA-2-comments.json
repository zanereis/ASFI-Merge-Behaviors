way.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-samoa/issues/comments/117605186/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-samoa/issues/comments/118828588","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-samoa/pull/31#issuecomment-118828588","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-samoa/issues/31","id":118828588,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExODgyODU4OA==","user":{"login":"abifet","id":4201874,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMDE4NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4201874?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abifet","html_url":"https://github.com/abifet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abifet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abifet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abifet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abifet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abifet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abifet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abifet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abifet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abifet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-06T11:41:24Z","updated_at":"2015-07-06T11:41:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-samoa/issues/comments/118828588/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-samoa/issues/comments/123266284","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-samoa/pull/32#issuecomment-123266284","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-samoa/issues/32","id":123266284,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyMzI2NjI4NA==","user":{"login":"gdfm","id":703859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMzg1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/703859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gdfm","html_url":"https://github.com/gdfm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gdfm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gdfm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gdfm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gdfm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gdfm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gdfm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gdfm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gdfm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gdfm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-21T11:15:54Z","updated_at":"2015-07-21T11:15:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@karande

A new AvroFileStream as a subclass of existing FileStream that will take in the encoding format (json/binary) from command-line. It will use InputStream  instead of current io Reader to handle Binary Streams.\n2. A common Loader interface to make the parsing of streams generic rather than only ARFF\n3. A new AvroLoader abstract class in samoa-instances that will handle the parsing of the Avro Generic Records from InputStream into SAMOA instances. If even one attribute in the Avro schema has a null union (nullable attribute) then it will be converted into  a SAMOA Sparse Instance else DenseInstance\n4. Two sub-classes of AvroLoader for Binary & JSON parsing i.e. AvroJsonLoader & AvroBinaryLoader . Both will set the meta-data & Avro schema on initialization. They will use separate decoders to read from the stream\n5. Appropriate changes in poms , Instances.java & ARFFLoader to use the new Loader interface \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-samoa/issues/comments/154003164/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-samoa/issues/comments/154997618","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-samoa/pull/40#issuecomment-154997618","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-samoa/issues/40","id":154997618,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NDk5NzYxOA==","user":{"login":"gdfm","id":703859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMzg1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/703859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gdfm","html_url":"https://github.com/gdfm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gdfm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gdfm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gdfm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gdfm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gdfm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gdfm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gdfm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gdfm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gdfm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-09T08:40:50Z","updated_at":"2015-11-09T08:40:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Overall looks pretty good!\nTested on Local and Storm 0.9.6.\nIf you can address a couple of minor comments, I am +1.\n@abifet @nicolas-kourtellis could you have a look at it as well, we need another +1.\nI'd also like to include the format docs somewhere.

bhupeshchawda,\n\nI was checking the adapter on apex. Great work and lots of it. Thanks for your effort.\n\nI tested it using the apex local mode and I had some initial comments on the performance primarily and one on the additions in samoa-api:\n\n1) The execution of the classification on both a fixed arff file (covTypeNorm) and the random tree generator are much slower (even 5-10 times slower) in comparison to the samoa-local (the basic local mode of Samoa for testing purposes). Can you check if this is a matter of the necessary overhead for the distributed execution or something else is causing the delay? I tested with various numbers for parallelism hint, but the observation holds.\n\n2) The results on covtypenorm should have been deterministic. That is, given that the file is the same used in repetitive runs, the results should be identical across runs (for sure given that parallelism is 1). However, when I run the VHT repetitively on the same arff file, the results are not the same across runs. Is there any fundamental reason why this would be happening? (Again, you can check for this using the local mode for testing).\n\n3) The results with the random tree generator show a good accuracy and similar to the one received with basic local mode of Samoa for testing. But the results on the arff file degrade in performance, lower than the basic local mode of Samoa. Any reason why this is happening? Maybe it has to do with the problem in comment 2?\n\n4) I noticed there are some changes in your PR regarding the samoa-api in about 10 files. These changes seem to be mostly related to Kryo serialization. Can you explain why you needed these done now? Also, do they affect the execution with the other adaptors and DSPEs? Also, maybe it would have made sense to push them in a different PR? Or do they need to be there for Apex to play along in the first place?\n\nThanks!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-samoa/issues/comments/226953697/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-samoa/issues/comments/227112051","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-samoa/pull/55#issuecomment-227112051","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-samoa/issues/55","id":227112051,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNzExMjA1MQ==","user":{"login":"bhupeshchawda","id":8895284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4OTUyODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8895284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhupeshchawda","html_url":"https://github.com/bhupeshchawda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhupeshchawda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhupeshchawda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhupeshchawda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhupeshchawda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhupeshchawda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhupeshchawda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhupeshchawda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhupeshchawda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhupeshchawda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-20T10:59:18Z","updated_at":"2016-06-20T10:59:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@nicolas-kourtellis Thanks a lot for your review.

This has to do with the way iteration works in Apex, which is tightly coupled to windowing. In case we don't limit the number of tuples, the tuples in a particular window keep on increasing due to the additional tuples that are fed on the iteration loop back stream. If the number of iterations is large enough, the amount of time taken to process a window of data increases beyond normal behaviour and the operator is killed by the Apex app master. I am working on identifying some workaround either to eliminate this limit, or to optimally set this limit. \n\n2) The execution in local mode of Apex is highly asynchronous with all operators in the topology running in different threads. The local mode of Samoa, on the other hand seems to be synchronous; i.e. the next tuple is processed only when the first one has been processed completely by all operators. I also tried to check executing the local mode of Storm, which also produces different results every time it is run for the same input file. \n\n3) I think this is due to the same reason in (2)\n\n4) Yes, these changes are necessary for Apex to function correctly. Apex relies on Kryo serialization (without any fall back on Java serialization) and hence is necessary for classes to have a default constructor. I think it will be better to have them as part of this PR. May be I can split them into a different commit if that helps?\n\nThanks!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-samoa/issues/comments/227381285/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-samoa/issues/comments/227584167","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-samoa/pull/55#issuecomment-227584167","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-samoa/issues/55","id":227584167,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNzU4NDE2Nw==","user":{"login":"davidyan74","id":4419148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTkxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4419148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidyan74","html_url":"https://github.com/davidyan74","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidyan74/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidyan74/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidyan74/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidyan74/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidyan74/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidyan74/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidyan74/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidyan74/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidyan74/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-21T21:53:56Z","updated_at":"2016-06-21T21:53:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@bhupeshchawda For the slow execution, we can do some tuning on the timeout window count, the window width and the number of tuples being generated for each window.

I am assuming that since the other DSPEs didn't need these objects to be serializable / serialized, the change shouldn't matter, but I wanted your opinion as well.\n\n2) Do you need to do similar changes to other parts of the samoa-api for the objects to be serialized? i.e., in other classifiers and clusterers in learning?\n\nThanks!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-samoa/issues/comments/237174032/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-samoa/issues/comments/237207057","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-samoa/pull/55#issuecomment-237207057","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-samoa/issues/55","id":237207057,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNzIwNzA1Nw==","user":{"login":"bhupeshchawda","id":8895284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4OTUyODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8895284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhupeshchawda","html_url":"https://github.com/bhupeshchawda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhupeshchawda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhupeshchawda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhupeshchawda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhupeshchawda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhupeshchawda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhupeshchawda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhupeshchawda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhupeshchawda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhupeshchawda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-03T11:00:37Z","updated_at":"2016-08-03T11:00:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi Nicolas,\nPlease find my responses below:\n1. I think these changes should not affect other DSPEs as these fields must have been either serializable or transient. I verified that these objects are created before being used.

I have a fix in the code to handle all other cases. These specific cases were not handled because these serializable classes have non-serializable elements in them which actually should have been transient.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-samoa/issues/comments/237207057/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-samoa/issues/comments/237483721","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-samoa/pull/55#issuecomment-237483721","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-samoa/issues/55","id":237483721,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNzQ4MzcyMQ==","user":{"login":"nicolas-kourtellis","id":6838775,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4Mzg3NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6838775?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolas-kourtellis","html_url":"https://github.com/nicolas-kourtellis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolas-kourtellis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolas-kourtellis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolas-kourtellis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolas-kourtellis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolas-kourtellis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolas-kourtellis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolas-kourtellis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolas-kourtellis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolas-kourtellis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-04T08:11:51Z","updated_at":"2016-08-04T08:11:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi Bhupesh,\n\nThanks for your responses. It makes sense indeed.\n\nOne more point regarding execution speed:\n- Even though things are faster now after the changes, I wonder if they can be even faster, (always depending on the data).\n- Do you think it makes sense to expose any of the windowing parameters needed in Apex on the higher layer (e.g., to be set by the user at command line)? In other words, do you think the optimization for the window length, number of tuples, etc., can be exposed to the user level and tested? Also, any guide on the values you picked?\n- I am asking this because I think depending on the type of data inputted, the optimization point maybe different and it would be good to be able to find it at least experimentally.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-samoa/issues/comments/237483721/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-samoa/issues/comments/242062386","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-samoa/pull/55#issuecomment-242062386","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-samoa/issues/55","id":242062386,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MjA2MjM4Ng==","user":{"login":"bhupeshchawda","id":8895284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4OTUyODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8895284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhupeshchawda","html_url":"https://github.com/bhupeshchawda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhupeshchawda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhupeshchawda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhupeshchawda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhupeshchawda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhupeshchawda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhupeshchawda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhupeshchawda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhupeshchawda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhupeshchawda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-24T13:25:54Z","updated_at":"2016-08-24T13:25:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi Nicolas,\nI completely agree with your point that the optimization point can change depending on the data and topology.

\nVerifying an Apex installation reduces to verifying the Hadoop installation. You can check if the YARN daemons (resource manager, node manager) and HDFS daemons (name node, data node and secondary name node) are running successfully, then Apex should work fine.\nCan you try installing https://www.datatorrent.com/downloads/3.5.0/datatorrent-rts-community-3.5.0.bin. This is the community edition of Datatorrent RTS and will give you access to the visualization as well as help you verify the installation.\n\nAlso, what is the exact command you are trying to run? Can you use the dump option (-d file) in the SAMOA args? You can then monitor this file to check if the output is generated successfully.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-samoa/issues/comments/250457221/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-samoa/issues/comments/253122600","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-samoa/pull/55#issuecomment-253122600","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-samoa/issues/55","id":253122600,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MzEyMjYwMA==","user":{"login":"bhupeshchawda","id":8895284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4OTUyODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8895284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhupeshchawda","html_url":"https://github.com/bhupeshchawda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhupeshchawda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhupeshchawda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhupeshchawda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhupeshchawda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhupeshchawda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhupeshchawda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhupeshchawda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhupeshchawda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhupeshchawda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-12T05:27:27Z","updated_at":"2016-10-12T05:27:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Added a section in `samoa-apex/README.md` on using Apex cli to view details on running applications.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-samoa/issues/comments/253122600/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
