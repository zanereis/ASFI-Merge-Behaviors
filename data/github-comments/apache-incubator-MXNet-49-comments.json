think I found a solution, just make the executor a local variable in a function. When the function returns, it gets released. Here I want to know more about the difference between bind and simple_bind. Since simple_bind only needs the shape of input, so unlike bind, which requires grad_arrays, does simple_bind need more time to allocate memory for grad_arrays? Is this just trivial time, or I have to consider? so if I simple_bind and create an executor for each batch. Do I have to worry about this time consumption?
