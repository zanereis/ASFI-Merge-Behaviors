Perhaps it warrants it's own JIRA for discussion/exploration.  </p>\n\n<p>Having multiple APIs is a pain from both a maintenance standpoint and from a user standpoint in deciding what to do.  You mean I have to rewrite things if I don't need exactly once any more and I want better performance? It would be nice to be able to support exactly once processing in a unified API with at least once and at most once.  Preferably something that is backwards compatible with the existing storm core API.  But I really haven't spent much time thinking through how that API would work/look.  For the most part I would expect it could look like the check-pointing code we have now, but some de-duping happening in there as well.  Either way I think this needs to be on a separate JIRA so we can discuss a long term plan for storm.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612904116/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612904123","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/5592#issuecomment-2612904123","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/5592","id":2612904123,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI5MDQxMjM=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-16T17:30:18Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T16:16:56Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=revans2\">revans2</a>:</i>\n<p><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=arunmahadevan\" class=\"user-hover\" rel=\"arunmahadevan\">Arun Mahadevan</a>,</p>\n\n<p>Great to hear that at least some of it can be reused.

class=\"user-hover\" rel=\"revans2\">Robert Joseph Evans</a> Currently, windowing support exists for processing time/event time with watermarks with a single trigger/eviction policy other than count based policies.</p>\n\n<p>I think we can enhance core windowing for supporting multiple active windows/panes with multiple triggers/custom eviction policies as mentioned in earlier <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-1757?focusedCommentId=15282971&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-15282971\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\">comment</a>. This should include checkpointing the panes. I plan to work next few days on this and add initial thoughts in <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-1763\" title=\"Add multiple trigger and eviction policy support for core windowing.\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"STORM-1763\"><del>STORM-1763</del></a>.</p>\n\n<p>Windowing can take the applied functions like reducer/aggregator etc and make appropriate optimizations in maintaining the pane state. Panes with accumulating eviction policies can have optimizations for reducer/aggregator without the need to store all the tuples in the pane state but by storing only the result value with required context. For ex, Avg function needs to store only the avg value and no of elements, these are sufficient in computing the accumulated value for the next pane. We can explore ways to optimize wherever it is possible.</p>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612904127/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/219719857","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1426#issuecomment-219719857","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1426","id":219719857,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxOTcxOTg1Nw==","user":{"login":"Darkless012","id":1187034,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODcwMzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1187034?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkless012","html_url":"https://github.com/Darkless012","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkless012/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkless012/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkless012/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkless012/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkless012/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkless012/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkless012/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkless012/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkless012/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-17T13:38:21Z","updated_at":"2016-05-17T13:38:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Or should this pull request be to branch 1.0.x ?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/219719857/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612904133","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/5592#issuecomment-2612904133","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/5592","id":2612904133,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI5MDQxMzM=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-17T14:01:47Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T16:16:57Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=satish.duggana\">satish.duggana</a>:</i>\n<p><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=arunmahadevan\" class=\"user-hover\" rel=\"arunmahadevan\">Arun Mahadevan</a> These features are done in core to have parity with Beam windowing features.

Currently, Maven 2.0 only supports using the \"nearest definition\" which means that it will use the version of the closest dependency to your project in the tree of dependencies. You can always guarantee a version by declaring it explicitly in your project's POM. Note that if two dependency versions are at the same depth in the dependency tree, until Maven 2.0.8 it was not defined which one would win, but since Maven 2.0.9 it's the order in the declaration that counts: the first declaration wins.\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>\"nearest definition\" means that the version used will be the closest one to your project in the tree of dependencies, eg. if dependencies for A, B, and C are defined as A -> B -> C -> D 2.0 and A -> E -> D 1.0, then D 1.0 will be used when building A because the path from A to D through E is shorter.
