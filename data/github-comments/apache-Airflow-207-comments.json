Therefore I ported a lot of  good ideas from the [\"Airflow Breeze\" environment](https://github.com/PolideaInternal/airflow-breeze/blob/master/README.md).  We used it for last half-year and I took the best and most relevant parts of it and added a very friendly \"./run_it_environment.sh\" script that manages locally the enviroment parallel to what we have in Travis CI:\r\n\r\n* It spins off the same environment as we have in Travis but it runs locally and is development/local test friendly (for example it maps local sources directly to the `airflow-testing` docker container).\r\n* It also manages the whole lifecycle of the docker images - it will pull/rebuild the image as needed (but it also allows to enter the environment super-fast (under 2 seconds) with -i flag once you have the docker images built). \r\n* It is rather user-friendly: `./run_it_environment.sh --python 3.6 --backend mysql --env docker` will do exactly what you expect it to do. It will drop you in the shell, with docker-compose environment and you can simply do `./run_tests.sh ....` to run the tests (including all integration tests requiring hadoop/mysql/postgres whatever).\r\n* You can also use `./run_it_environment.sh` to run tests automatically instead of entering interactive bash (you can to specify `--test-target` in the command line).\r\n* You will be able (that's not ported yet :)) to forward local ports on your host to webserver/postgres/mysql databases run in your environment - you will be able to connect to theme with your local Browser/database management/browsing tools.\r\n* You can see all the current command line switches here: https://github.com/PolideaInternal/airflow/blob/multi-layered-dockerfile/CONTRIBUTING.md#run-it-environment-flags\r\n* I have not looked yet at kubernetes tests - but it might be easier to fix them by adding another docker-compose image rather than using the current minikube approach (as suggested by AIP-7) - I might actually be able to get some community support for that maybe (see below)\r\n\r\nThis `./run_it_environment.sh` seems to address as well most of the AIP-7 (\"Simplified development workflow\") - so we can kill two birds with the same stone. I went ahead and updated the [CONTRIBUTING doc](https://github.com/PolideaInternal/airflow/blob/multi-layered-dockerfile/CONTRIBUTING.md#setting-up-a-development-environment) in my branch - I made a clean distinction between the three environments we have (Virtualenv, Docker container, Docker Compose base integration test environment). I also explained advantages/disadvantages of each environment - I think it is not clear especially for first time contributors which environment they should use in which case.\r\n\r\n## Involving community\r\n\r\nI think it's about the highest time to involve community more and get a bit more feedback (especially in relation to AIP-7) even before I fix all the tests. I did some restructuring of CI scripts to make them more obvious/consistent, and I would like to keep it running as a PR with Travis tests for some time (continuously rebasing it) and seeing if the build times/test results are as I expect it to be. I can continue doing that using my private DockerHub/Travis CI and share the results with the community.\r\n\r\nWhat I want to do as well - before I involve the community - I want to update AIP-10 (\"Multi-layered docker file\") with a bit more explanation (and actual design :) ) of how the current Multi-staging Dockerfile is constructed, what images will be in the DockerHub registry, and how it will work for different cases including caching/wheel behaviour (it works slightly differently for DockerHub build, Travis Build, and local build in `./run_it_environment.sh`. There are different optimisations implemented for those different cases to minimise build times. \r\n\r\nOnce I involve community, maybe I will be able to get some help especially in making the kubernetes tests work properly - it was suggested in AIP-7 that we should do it with moving minikube to be separate docker-compose image and I think it should be fairly easy.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your comments :) What do you think?

Since I do not know the time when the file will be available or it's complete path I am driving the DAG with an SQS event.  The sensor retrieves the message containing file path etc, and passes it to the next processor to consume the file.  This allows me to use airflow sensors nice features like timeout, manage task dependencies, etc.  It can also be used for any other type of sqs message.  The sensor is similar to [pub sub sensor](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/airflow/contrib/sensors/pubsub_sensor.py).\r\n  \r\nPlease let me know if there is a better way to implementing this workflow.

I do not understand why it did not pop up.\r\n\r\nI have some questions about it:\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n> There might be fields I don't want rendered (maybe I use Jinja templating internally)\r\n\r\nThis is a good point. In such a case, shouldn't Airflow templating process be preferred?\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n> Due to the dynamic nature of Python, I might want to render fields that can't be found via introspection\r\n\r\nI'm pretty new with python, how this could happen? Isn't introspection meant to provide all existing attributes, methods, and so on, on an object? Do you have any example or reading about it?\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n> I think a viable alternative would be to use the same approach as for operators - declare which fields need templating using a template_fields class variable.\r\n\r\nIt is a good alternative to avoid the first point: just choose the fields we want to be templated.\r\nBut then, we need to manipulate a class (add a class attribute) to make sure its fields will be rendered. \r\n\r\nOne thing I really appreciate with approach # 3 is that is works without any change on classes. just setting a templated value on any attribute from any class (in an operator template_field), and this value will be rendered during DAG execution.\r\n\r\nIf we have to customize a class so that its inner fields are templated, would you rather add a `template_field` class attribute, or define a `render_template` custom method (approach # 2)?\r\n\r\nI hope I'm clear enough...
