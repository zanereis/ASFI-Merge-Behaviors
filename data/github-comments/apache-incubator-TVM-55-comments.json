There have been several discussions in the community around related questions \r\n- https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/how-to-handle-partial-tile/408/2\r\n- https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/loop-partitioning-and-tensorization-work-on-different-ir-levels/876\r\n\r\nI am editing this issue to an RFC so folks can do more discussions in here. So far, we didn't directly tackle the problem, mainly because in the case of common deep learning workloads, most of the things are quite regular. However, this is an important thing that should be tackled.\r\n\r\nThere are a few solutions like you mentioned, which falls into three categories\r\n\r\n- 1) Loop partition into a stable loop and a tail: TVM already has the pass, although it may not well optimized.\r\n- 2) Predicated load: This usually need special hardware support\r\n- 3) Automate padding: pad the input or output to a regular size before continue.\r\n\r\nThe main drawback of loop partition and predication is that they need special hardware support. Loop partition requires the processor to have both scalar and vector unit, while predication needs hw to support predication.  So far I personally like the automatic padding solution the best, as it can happen at a high level and still works for accelerator case.\r\n\r\nLet us keep this issue open for discussions around these directions, and hopefully, we can have a few solutions to try out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/432891372/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/432893465","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/1980#issuecomment-432893465","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1980","id":432893465,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMjg5MzQ2NQ==","user":{"login":"wweic","id":594848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NDg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/594848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic","html_url":"https://github.com/wweic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-25T02:37:02Z","updated_at":"2018-10-25T02:37:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hey, it would be great if you can add a [unit test](https://docs.tvm.ai/contribute/pull_request.html)(either in python or c++).

agree that without first two working (efficiently) in tvm, padding seems the only way. \r\nThat's my current workaround for this issue. \r\nI only call it a workaround instead of a solution.

be highly associated with split/tile sizes, \r\nwhich are parameters of low-level transformation. \r\nThat seems slightly contradicting the design of decoupling high-level/low-level IR.\r\n\r\n-L","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/432899545/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/432901785","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/1972#issuecomment-432901785","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1972","id":432901785,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMjkwMTc4NQ==","user":{"login":"srkreddy1238","id":14215163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjE1MTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14215163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238","html_url":"https://github.com/srkreddy1238","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-25T03:27:18Z","updated_at":"2018-10-25T03:27:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@wincle

If something is in flux and not yet critical to the developments, we will keep it in the language bindings(e.g. python), let it plays out and wait until it stablizes.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly there are tradeoffs, having everything in c++ makes the API available to all languages, but it is also not necessarily flexible. For example, in the case of monitoring, printing things out to a log may not be as flexible as defining a customized callback and let the user do what they want to do. \r\n\r\nHaving some of the things in python(for example, most of our test cases are) gives some speed up to the development process and allows us to write more test cases easily.\r\n\r\nIn both cases, we should document it clearly, so it would be really nice to have a tutorial to teach users on all the possible ways to do

I think it makes sense to modularize the code whenever possible. There are several differences between the onnx and caffe2 frontends:\r\n1. How the opset is loaded. As @zhreshold noted, caffe2 loads the model by parsing caffe2.proto and onnx loads the model by parsing onnx.proto.\r\n2. For the operators that are similar or even identical, mostly elementwise and math ops, the OpConverter can definitely be shared\r\n3. The nn ops are where they differ the most, because:\r\n- Caffe2 supports both NCHW and NHWC layouts. The float32 backend mostly uses NCHW, but the int8 backend is NHWC only. ONNX supports only NCHW.\r\n- Caffe2 uses a larger set of arguments/attributes. For example, there are three ways to represent kernel shape: 'kernel', 'kernels', or 'kernel_h' and 'kernel_w', similarly for padding, strides, and dilations. \r\n- In some ops, caffe2 handles tensor flattening implicitly. For example. in the FC(dense) op, the input can be a 4D or 2D tensor, which is flattened into a 2D tensor inside the op.\r\n\r\n  Given these differences, I find it hard to differentiate the caffe2/onnx converters with modular settings.

me try this. :)\r\nIt is all about semantics of split, particularly for tail condition.\r\n\r\nThe current semantics of split is to split iteration space inner and outer by a factor k. (a) When there is a tail condition, put if guard in every outer and inner.\r\n\r\nThe proposed one is (b) When there is a tail condition, put if guard in the tail.\r\n\r\nThe potential low-level tvm's padding is (c) When there is a tail condition, tvm implicitly extend the original space, (and then crop it?).\r\n\r\nAnother one good like shifting, (d) When there is a tail condition, tvm shift the last iteration inside.\r\n\r\nThe high-level padding is (e) this situation wouldn't happen, since we handle properly in high-level.\r\n(Joking)\r\n\r\nTo me, (a) seems a little bit dumb.\r\n(b), (c), (d) is reasonable.\r\nHow to achieve them depends on the codegen.\r\ntvm can always generate proper instruction, like predicated or scalarization. \r\n\r\nThe semantics of vectorize is \"a suggestion to vectorize a iteration axis\".\r\nIt could be relaxed. In the case of current tvm, (a), it gets relaxed by if condition.\r\nIn (b), it is only relaxed in the tail.\r\n(c) and (d), not relaxed.\r\nIt is hard to judge which one is faster without context.\r\ntvm can introduce all tail condition as a part of split schedule.\r\n\r\nFor ASIC having no scalar unit, I think that is totally different thing.\r\nIf a user could always write a vectorization unfriendly schedule or code and ask to generate code to that ASIC, it could fail that ASIC too.\r\ntvm still need a proper schedule for an ASIC.\r\nMaking your semantics to overfit an ASIC seems weird to me. \r\nIf tvm takes tail condition as a part of split schedule, for ASIC, we can just use proper tail condition.\r\nAlso, using high-level padding does not contract with the refinement of split's semantics.\r\nBut binding tvm with a high-level ir and then implicitly forcing people to it by leaving a inefficient code in tvm seems also weird to me.\r\nIt should be a user's choice to use a high-level ir or not.\r\n\r\n-L\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/433274215/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/433289292","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/1864#issuecomment-433289292","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1864","id":433289292,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMzI4OTI5Mg==","user":{"login":"wweic","id":594848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NDg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/594848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic","html_url":"https://github.com/wweic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-26T05:17:36Z","updated_at":"2018-10-26T05:17:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"`test_forward_reduce` and `test_forward_reduce` are failed because `TOPI_REDUCE_ATLEAST1D` is 0:\r\nhttps://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/44df04a1ef1d0f6dd36b0863695e5ea021d9d759/topi/include/topi/reduction.h#L27-L29\r\n\r\nso that `MakeReduceTargetShape` deduced empty shape for reduction op that reduces on all axes:\r\nhttps://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/44df04a1ef1d0f6dd36b0863695e5ea021d9d759/topi/include/topi/reduction.h#L107-L109\r\n\r\nI think we should always set `TOPI_REDUCE_ATLEAST1D` to 1? @tqchen ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/433289292/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/433291385","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/1999#issuecomment-433291385","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1999","id":433291385,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMzI5MTM4NQ==","user":{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-26T05:32:15Z","updated_at":"2018-10-26T05:32:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for contribution.
