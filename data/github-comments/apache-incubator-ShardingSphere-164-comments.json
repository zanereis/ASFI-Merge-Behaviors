Instance methods are more friendly to extend, such as hierarchy override.\r\n1. From my personal preference, the static method doesn't bring a better user experience in this case.\r\n\r\nBut, at the same time, I want to point out, \r\n1. There is a duplicated `dbType` parameter for the `visitor`, no matter either way. As the parsing result, you definitely have known the type, this second `dbType` could be skipped and auto-injection through the ASTTree.\r\n1. `useCache` seems like a configuration?
