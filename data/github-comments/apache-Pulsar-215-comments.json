Step back - what is the real concern preventing you adding a flag?\r\n\r\nGiving the false impression that data is retained, when in fact is not. \r\n\r\nHoping that a reconnection doesn't happen is not a guarantee.\r\n\r\nAs I already said, the Reader concept was designed in this way. If we want to change or augment the semantics and the guarantees, a flag per-se doesn't accomplish anything.\r\n\r\n> In order to make Pulsar as real stream storage, we need to take serious consideration on the reader's behavior.\r\n\r\nAgain, as I said, there are different ways to guarantee the data retention. Time based is one, a subscription is another. What your describing is essentially a reader that behaves like a subscription..
