In a short version, the way *StatefulSets* work make possible for spark to resolve livy's pod ip by hostname and talk to it directly, bypassing the *Service*.\r\n\r\nOur experience with livy on kubernetes has trully exceded our expectations. I've used livy with hadoop cluster on k8s for more than a year and was not a pleasant experience. It worked fine for my case as we had few small jobs running, but could not handle more jobs easely. Our demand grew and the current setup is on EKS, running cluster-autoscaller and almost all of your proposed stack (livy, spark-history-server, jupyterhub, monitoring). It fits nicely with our workflow and now our test environment is much more reliable and cheap than our production.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/comments/523426742/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/comments/523456656","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-livy/pull/200#issuecomment-523456656","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/200","id":523456656,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMzQ1NjY1Ng==","user":{"login":"tisonkun","id":18818196,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4ODE4MTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18818196?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun","html_url":"https://github.com/tisonkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-21T13:28:17Z","updated_at":"2019-08-21T13:28:17Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I think another solution should be use an auto-retest trigger instead of close-reopen which would pollute notification quite a lot...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/comments/523456656/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/comments/523716161","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-livy/pull/200#issuecomment-523716161","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/200","id":523716161,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMzcxNjE2MQ==","user":{"login":"captainzmc","id":13825159,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODI1MTU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13825159?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/captainzmc","html_url":"https://github.com/captainzmc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/captainzmc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/captainzmc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/captainzmc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/captainzmc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/captainzmc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/captainzmc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/captainzmc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/captainzmc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/captainzmc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-22T02:03:58Z","updated_at":"2019-08-22T02:03:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"That sounds great，Thanks tison.
