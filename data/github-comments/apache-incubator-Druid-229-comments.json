This was sort of ugly because SequenceMetadata was calling methods on it's parent SeekableStreamIndexTaskRunner, so those methods now take a runner as an argument.\r\n\r\nI haven't read the patch yet (will soon), but, I don't necessarily think that this kind of change is ugly! The new structure might even be better.

And it contains overshadowed segments and their `is_published` column is set to `true`, which may not be the correct behavior because those overshadowed segments are going to be marked `used=0` once compaction finishes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/472630687/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/472647453","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/7217#issuecomment-472647453","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7217","id":472647453,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MjY0NzQ1Mw==","user":{"login":"justinborromeo","id":9417701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0MTc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9417701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinborromeo","html_url":"https://github.com/justinborromeo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinborromeo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinborromeo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinborromeo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinborromeo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinborromeo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinborromeo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinborromeo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinborromeo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinborromeo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-13T23:36:10Z","updated_at":"2019-03-13T23:36:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I was thinking of adding the exception and state data to the /v1/supervisor/{id}/status endpoint instead of creating a new endpoint.

The bottom of that list could have some items of equal weight that could represent noise in the sense that they may not have a weight that is greater than the weight of all remaining items not on the list.  Nonetheless, this would be considered the \"exact\" solution. \r\n\r\nHowever, in the attempts to speed up the horribly slow brute-force SQL query above, and based on what was described above in this thread, the Druid \"TopN\" algorithm was created to do this (I think this is right):\r\n\r\nM Historical Nodes:\r\n1. \"First Truncation\": All intra-segment resultsets (which are exact) are sorted (using a priority queue) and truncated to max(k, 1000). Call that _K_.\r\n2. \"Pre-Aggregation\": Then the historical node merges all those per-segment resultsets pairwise by first combining the 2K elements based on the aggregation key, then sorting those 2K elements (again, using a priority queue) into a new priority queue of size _K_.\r\n3. Each H-Node passes a sorted resultset of size max(k, 1000) to the broker.\r\n\r\nBroker Node:\r\n\r\n4. 2nd Truncation and \"Post-Aggregation\": The data from all M H-Nodes is gathered, and sorted and truncated again using a Priority Queue with a size max(k, 1000).\r\n5. K items are reported as the result.\r\n\r\n**These truncations and aggregations change everything!**\r\n\r\nThe **first belief** that:\r\n> The current topN algorithm **can be used for any query** shaped like SELECT x, AGG(y) FROM table ORDER BY AGG(y) DESC LIMIT N when useApproximateTopN is enabled.\r\n\r\nThis belief is a total fiction and this claim will fail miserably. \r\n\r\nThe **second belief**:\r\n> Going back to your song example, could FIS support getting the top song titles by number of unique listeners over the past week? **The current topN can do that using HLL sketches as metric** (weight). That's one example of the usefulness of accepting any Druid aggregation or post-aggregation as a metric.\r\n\r\nThis claim of the ability to plug-in HLL sketches as the aggregator will also fail miserably.  \r\n\r\nThe **third** belief:\r\n> It sounds like FIS is **limited** in a couple ways that prevents it from being used for all queries of that form: (because)\r\n> **\"AGG\" must be \"SUM\" and y must all be positive**. (topN will accept any aggregation function and any y)\r\n\r\nThe view here is that somehow FIS is \"limited\", and is a \"subset case\" because it can only `sum` positive values is seriously misguided.  \r\n\r\nIn fact the **only** \"aggregation\" operation that can possibly produce any meaningful results with the Druid TopN algorithm is a sum of positive weights. And this  case that kinda-sorta works is when the data in the H-nodes is pre-aggregated (only sum of positive weights allowed) prior to the 1st truncation (Priority Queue). Then the PQs are merged, summed and PQed again, before passing to the Broker.  The process in the Broker would be similar.  But this still could have significant errors.\r\n\r\nThe **forth** belief:\r\n> \"LIMIT\" (using FIS) will not necessarily be adhered to. (topN will always return LIMIT results, or the number of distinct values of x, whichever is lower).  \r\n\r\nThis is also misguided.  For a set of items where all have the same weight, there is no TopN!  Any random selection of N values from the set could be a \"valid\" result, which makes the name \"TopN\" meaningless.  In order for a set of values to have a \"Top\", there must be some skew in their weights.\r\n\r\nSuppose the set has 1000 items with weight 1, and 2 items of weight 10.  The top-100 will have the two heavy items, the other 98 could be randomly chosen from the remainder of the original set .  Those 98 add no insight as they are essentially noise.  So to require that there be N items returned from a TopN query is severely misguided.  The Druid TopN also doesn't tell you which one of the small end of the TopN are noise, making it even less useful.  The better term to use is either \"Frequent Items\" or \"Heavy Hitters\", both of which are used in the scientific literature.\r\n\r\n----\r\nIn conclusion:\r\n\r\n1. The belief that a query of the shape `SELECT x, AGG(y) FROM table ORDER BY AGG(y) DESC LIMIT N` can actually produce meaningful results using the Druid TopN algorithm is misguided.  It is especially misguided if the item weights are negative  or those aggregations are non-linear functions such as an HLL sketch.  \r\n\r\n2. The only query that might kinda-sorta-sometimes produce meaningful results is when the weights are positive and the aggregations are `sum`.  But if this is the case, why not use the FIS, which operates with positive weights and the \"aggregation\" is a `sum`.   And it will produce far superior results.\r\n\r\nIn other words the FIS is not a subset of what can be usefully queried, it is the ONLY query set that can produce meaningful results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/473491408/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/473508823","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/7187#issuecomment-473508823","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7187","id":473508823,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MzUwODgyMw==","user":{"login":"peferron","id":7009852,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMDk4NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7009852?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peferron","html_url":"https://github.com/peferron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peferron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peferron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peferron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peferron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peferron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peferron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peferron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peferron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peferron/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-16T07:39:35Z","updated_at":"2019-03-16T07:41:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@leerho \r\n\r\n> The **first belief** that:\r\n> \r\n> > The current topN algorithm **can be used for any query** shaped like SELECT x, AGG(y) FROM table ORDER BY AGG(y) DESC LIMIT N when useApproximateTopN is enabled.\r\n> \r\n> This belief is a total fiction and this claim will fail miserably.\r\n\r\nYou can use `topN` with any aggregation and get back results. This is a fact, not a belief. The misguided belief would be that these results are always meaningful, but I don't recall anybody here saying that; it has been repeated again and again that `topN` is data-sensitive.\r\n\r\n> The **second belief**:\r\n> \r\n> This claim of the ability to plug-in HLL sketches as the aggregator will also fail miserably.\r\n\r\nSame answer as above.

That happens to be my case, so I just ran queries against about a billion rows of real-world data. The queries are `SELECT x, COUNT(DISTINCT y) GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 2 DESC LIMIT 5`.\r\n\r\nIn the first test, `x` is a dimension with a cardinality of 30k, and `y` is another dimension with high cardinality. `topN` returns the same results as `groupBy` (which is the exact counterpart of `topN`), but 30% faster.\r\n\r\nIn the second test, `x` is a dimension with a cardinality of 2M. `groupBy` cannot return results because it exceeds resource limits. After reducing the query interval enough to bring the cardinality of `x` down to levels that `groupBy` can handle, `topN` again returns the same results as `groupBy`, but 75% faster.\r\n\r\nSo, here we are—meaningful results produced using `topN` with HLL, and with significant performance gains.\r\n\r\nThese are the first queries I tried, but I'm sure I could find some where `topN` fails miserably. That's not the point, though—the point is that `topN` works well in some cases, as demonstrated. You seem to think that Druid users, including participants in this discussion, are incapable of identifying these cases, and are using `topN` only because they don't understand how badly it can fail. That's certainly your prerogative, and you may be right for the possibly large number of Druid users who don't dig into how the system works or read the documentation. As a somewhat power user though, I'm happy to have a tool like `topN` at my disposal, even if it's up to me to use it responsibly.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I certainly hope that Druid goes towards a direction where error bounds are systematically provided, as discussed in #7160.
