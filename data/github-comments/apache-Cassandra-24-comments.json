old-CRC is initiating then the new-CRC has to validate against the old-CRC, so it must have the old-CRC code and be ready to used it.\r\nif the new CRC is initiating then it must use the old CRC to communicate with the old-CRC.\r\n\r\nSo the old-CRC code still has to exist in the codebase and it has to be used for session initiation. \r\n\r\nIs there something in the new code that guarantees that the initiation sequencde uses the old-CRC?\r\n\r\nMy thought is that we could use another flag in the init header the on initiation being set means (I accept new-CRC) and the a new-CRC supporting client could respond with a message that also has the bit set and uses the new-CRC, so that we can jump into the new protocol

Other than that, just as it was already mentioned, we need a test for the `DirectIOSegment` - it could be a unit test with mocking most of the stuff.

I suggest implement it using quick theories so that we catch the edge cases.\r\n> \r\n> Additionally, it would be great to have some test which can verify different configuration paths.\r\n> \r\n> We are open to help you with testing and other stuff, feel free to ask.\r\n> \r\n> I'm going to modify the default configuration to use the direct IO for commit log and run the tests then so that we can be sure that new functionality is in use.\r\n\r\nI didn't realize and it may take more time to do all these changes.
