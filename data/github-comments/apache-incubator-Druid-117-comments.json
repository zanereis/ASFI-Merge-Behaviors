Negative effects vary from inconsistent CPUTime/Query time measurement (including/not \"closing time\" of the wrapped sequence) to memory leaks and who knows what effects, because some \"sub-resources\" are closed after \"super-resources\", i. e. the resources the former are \"derived\" from. Taking `accumulate()` or `Yielder` path is hardly trackable and undetermined in some sense, because applying e. g. `Sequences.limit()` on upper level turns `accumulate()` into `Yielder` iteration underneath (because it's a `YieldingSequenceBase`)\r\n\r\n2. It's just breaks general Yielder implementation contract, when \"the same thing\" should be done in `toYielder()` and `next()`. It's hard to say if it is a bug or not right now, (if `MissingSegmentsException` is always thrown in `toYielder()`, it is not), but it could become a bug at any point in future.\r\n\r\n3. At the moment it removes some repetitive code. I originally did this because I added more to those code as part of my project of increasing amount and precision of query metrics. And repeating 30 lines of code in three places felt much more dangerous and boilerplate than repeating 10 lines. (This change is not yet in the PR itself, because it's blocked by this PR).\r\n\r\n4. This addresses #3563. Attempt to match try-with-resources safety in Sequences. Try-with-resources always catch Throwables and use `addSuppressed()` when needed. Current code catches either `Exception` or `RuntimeException` and logs exceptions which should better be suppressed. Suppression allows to see more actual exceptions in query response, for example. Generally it guarantees that two exceptions (\"main\" and suppressed) are logged at the same place, wherever it is done. Logging one exception and propagating the another may \"unlink\" those two in the unified log.\r\n\r\n5. Just remove unused code (merging java-util, extendedset, bytebuffer-collections, etc. opens a lot of such opportunities)\r\n\r\n6. Eases Sequences refactoring in future, and generally static factory methods are considered better than constructors, but really a minor thing (and it's only a couple of lines in this PR)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/263769806/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/263856029","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/3720#issuecomment-263856029","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3720","id":263856029,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2Mzg1NjAyOQ==","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-30T11:55:19Z","updated_at":"2016-11-30T11:55:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi

The only questions I have left are:\r\n\r\n- Can you move MapVirtualColumn to a contrib extension? It seems kind of specialty and not a good fit for core.\r\n- The `.` dot notation for embedding extra details in the column doesn't seem necessary to me; could it be replaced by adding that to the constructor of the virtual column?\r\n\r\nIn that case, VirtualColumn would become:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n/**\r\n * Virtual columns are \"views\" created over a ColumnSelectorFactory. They can potentially draw from multiple\r\n * underlying columns, although they always present themselves as if they were a single column.\r\n */\r\npublic interface VirtualColumn\r\n{\r\n  /**\r\n   * Output name of this column.\r\n   *\r\n   * @return name\r\n   */\r\n  String getOutputName();\r\n\r\n  /**\r\n   * Build a selector corresponding to this virtual column.\r\n   *\r\n   * @param factory column selector factory\r\n   * @return the selector\r\n   */\r\n  ObjectColumnSelector init(ColumnSelectorFactory factory);\r\n\r\n  byte[] getCacheKey();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd MapVirtualColumn's constructor would become:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  @JsonCreator\r\n  public MapVirtualColumn(\r\n      @JsonProperty(\"keyDimension\") String keyDimension,\r\n      @JsonProperty(\"valueDimension\") String valueDimension,\r\n      @JsonProperty(\"outputName\") String outputName,\r\n      @JsonProperty(\"targetKeyValue\") String targetKeyValue\r\n  )\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd \"targetKeyValue\" would be used instead of the part after the dot in the column name. So if a user wants to get \"map.k1\" and \"map.k2\" as VCs, they would define two VCs, one for each.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/264060377/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/264063643","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/2511#issuecomment-264063643","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2511","id":264063643,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NDA2MzY0Mw==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-01T02:44:57Z","updated_at":"2016-12-01T02:48:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Or, another option: retain the behavior in the current diff, but make it optional, so VCs that don't want to have the dot notation stuff apply to them don't have to have it.

things that HavingSpecs don't currently support such as regex, \"in\", javascript, use of extractionFns, etc.\r\n- simplifies the SQL layer in #3682 since it can generate DimFilters for both WHERE and
