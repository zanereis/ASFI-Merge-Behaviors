The precision relies on MAL, has nothing related to float or long.\r\n\r\nIf the precision is completely controlled by MAL/OAL, then it is more appropriate to display the integer milliseconds of the latency (response time) on the UI, because the unit of latency itself is milliseconds and `readMetricsValue` returns a Long type value, so the decimal place has no value when displaying in milliseconds.\r\nOr latency increases the multiple when aggregated like sla and apdex to ensure the accuracy of average calculation, and finally divides by the multiple when visualizing.\r\n\r\nsla and apdex is multiplied by 10000 when aggregated\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/skywalking/blob/d6fa688ff8022c766cfaf3681c3b5f9113fc877f/oap-server/server-core/src/main/java/org/apache/skywalking/oap/server/core/analysis/metrics/PercentMetrics.java#L64-L66\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/skywalking/blob/d6fa688ff8022c766cfaf3681c3b5f9113fc877f/oap-server/server-core/src/main/java/org/apache/skywalking/oap/server/core/analysis/metrics/ApdexMetrics.java#L92-L94\r\n\r\nAnd then divided by 100 and 10000 when [visualizing](https://github.com/apache/skywalking-booster-ui/blob/1f98619a5b4ddbac4ac990dc5465b9b59bfa3349/src/hooks/useMetricsProcessor.ts#L473-L487)\r\n```ts\r\ncase Calculations.PercentageAvg:\r\n  data = (val / 100).toFixed(2);\r\n  break;\r\ncase Calculations.Apdex:\r\n  data = (val / 10000).toFixed(2);\r\n  break;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe latency is collected and calculated in milliseconds of Long type, and displayed in milliseconds with two decimal places.
