I think we will have to do vote for an official release.  Otherwise you will have to build from source and create your own distribution.  We are in progress of updating the docs now.  There is an open PR for the website that has about half of the work done with a checklist of things to do for updating our docs.  Feel free to check it out.

Is there a way in the heron helm chart to change the storage class for the journal-disk and ledger-disk volumeClaimTemplates from default using the values.yaml? I also am on a \"bare-metal\" install, so im not sure I get the option to use the volumeClaimTemplates at all\r\n\r\nThanks again","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/500986657/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/500999295","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/3219#issuecomment-500999295","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/3219","id":500999295,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMDk5OTI5NQ==","user":{"login":"nwangtw","id":6353055,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNTMwNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6353055?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwangtw","html_url":"https://github.com/nwangtw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwangtw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwangtw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwangtw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwangtw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwangtw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwangtw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwangtw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwangtw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwangtw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-11T19:57:16Z","updated_at":"2019-06-11T19:57:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I am wondering who is the owner of that file and if there is a log of changes in that file?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/500999295/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/501003361","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/3219#issuecomment-501003361","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/3219","id":501003361,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMTAwMzM2MQ==","user":{"login":"simingweng","id":4026795,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjY3OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4026795?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/simingweng","html_url":"https://github.com/simingweng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simingweng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simingweng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simingweng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simingweng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simingweng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simingweng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simingweng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simingweng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simingweng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-11T20:09:15Z","updated_at":"2019-06-11T20:11:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I did adapt the relevant Helm templates in this PR. So, theoretically, you should be able to install the chart from locally. But, the tricky part is that there's no post-0.17.8 official release available in public, which means no heron post-0.17.8 docker image in public.\r\n\r\nThe reason you will need post-0.17.8 Heron docker image is because there're other changes across the code base to migrate to newer Bookkeeper Client dependencies.\r\n\r\nSo, what we did in our deployment is to build heron RC release, push the docker image built to our own Artifactory repository, also push the generated maven artifacts there. Then, in our k8s cluster (we're on-promise), we configure the cluster to include our own Artifactory docker image repo.\r\n\r\nThen we maintain a slightly different version of Helm chart based on the bare metal flavor of the templates available in this code base, because we're on-promise, and we don't need to care about GKE, AWS. So, our in house helm chart is simplified, but fairly close to the one in the source.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/501003361/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
