This is true for the non-windowed case as well. Fixing this might\nrequire some work in the DirectRunner - @tgroh can comment.\n\n2. 1 bundle per key is true of the Dataflow streaming runner, but is in\ngeneral runner dependent. This is true of unwindowed FileBasedSinks as\nwell, this is not new in the windowing support.\n\nI see two regressions in your PR from mine (one of which was also caught by\na test).

There's still that PubsubIO commit. Please rebase -i github/master and delete the commit; if that doesn't work, do something like: git checkout github/master; git cherry-pick $commit (for every useful commit in this PR); git checkout -B streaming_auto_shard_write\r\n- There's a lot of formatting changes (the bulk of this PRs diff is formatting changes), roll them back?\r\n- Should this apply also to other streaming runners - Spark, Flink, Apex?\r\n- I think we're trying to minimize use of PipelineOptions at construction time. Would it make sense to access options.getMaxNumWorkers() at runtime instead, via a do-once ParDo or something?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/300530005/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/300534111","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/2988#issuecomment-300534111","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/2988","id":300534111,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMDUzNDExMQ==","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-10T16:14:53Z","updated_at":"2017-05-10T16:14:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"R: @tgroh finally green!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/300534111/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/300535578","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3035#issuecomment-300535578","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3035","id":300535578,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMDUzNTU3OA==","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-10T16:20:05Z","updated_at":"2017-05-10T16:20:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The flink tests that are failing certainly aren't related to this.
