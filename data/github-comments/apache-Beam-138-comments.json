This would allow the table mapping to operate on Foo\ninstead of TableRow. It would also better open the door for convenience\nmappers that could automatically generate a correct schema from Avro types\nand convert the Avro type to a TableRow.\n\nI refrained from implementing this earlier as it's a major\nbackwards-incompatible change, and would probably engender a degree of\nbikeshedding. However it might be a better approach for BigQueryIO.Write in\ngeneral, so worth bringing up.\n\nOn Tue, Mar 7, 2017 at 8:03 AM, Eugene Kirpichov <notifications@github.com>\nwrote:\n\n> *@jkff* requested changes on this pull request.\n>\n> Thanks!
