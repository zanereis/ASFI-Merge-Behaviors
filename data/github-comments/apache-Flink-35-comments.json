Given the non-deterministic nature of the algorithms, some tests fail sometimes. I am looking into this. I am considering  leaving out tests for the accuracy of the algorithms (in the Accumulator test), given that they are already programmed in other test classes. This should avoid these \"algorithm accuracy\" related errors in the OperatorStatisticsAccumulatorTest class.\n\nAlso, I have been refactoring this code to avoid using the conditionals that check which statistics are being collected in the \"process\" and \"merge\" methods. This is based on a remark that @fhueske made way earlier in the PR. Should I try and make a PR for the refactored code, or rather leave this in its current state, and wait until it is merged until I make a PR for the refactored version?\n\nCheers!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/109990676/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/109990975","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/796#issuecomment-109990975","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/796","id":109990975,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwOTk5MDk3NQ==","user":{"login":"mjsax","id":8959638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NTk2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8959638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax","html_url":"https://github.com/mjsax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-08T13:13:41Z","updated_at":"2015-06-08T13:18:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I am on Debian, too... \nmjsax@T420s-dbis-mjsax:~$ SLAVE=\"#comment\"; if [[ \"$SLAVE\" =~ ^([0-9a-zA-Z/.-]+)._$ ]] ; then echo \"${BASH_REMATCH[1]}\"; else echo \"missmatch\"; fi\nmissmatch\nmjsax@T420s-dbis-mjsax:~$ SLAVE=\"host#comment\"; if [[ \"$SLAVE\" =~ ^([0-9a-zA-Z/.-]+)._$ ]] ; then echo \"${BASH_REMATCH[1]}\"; else echo \"missmatch\"; fi\nhost\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/109990975/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/109992966","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/796#issuecomment-109992966","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/796","id":109992966,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwOTk5Mjk2Ng==","user":{"login":"mjsax","id":8959638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NTk2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8959638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax","html_url":"https://github.com/mjsax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-08T13:17:17Z","updated_at":"2015-06-08T13:17:17Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The regex matches everything up to the first character that is not '0-9a-zA-Z/.-' Thus, any non matching character is uses as cut-off (e.g. blank, tab, @, |, ...).\nI think we should remove the if-then completely.

You don't need to filterOnEdges. Have a closer look at removeVertices. Imagine what happens if you remove a vertex, the edge will also have to be removed. You cannot leave an edge with just the source or the target vertex trailing.\n- I think you forgot to add the corner case test for an input graph which does not have common vertices with the first one. I know you wrote it :) \n-  Finally, if you have a look at the Travis build here, it failed because you are indenting with spaces instead of tabs. You should play a bit with your IntelliJ settings. No worries! This is a rookie mistake, we all did it at first. To check everything is okay, just do a cd flink-staging/flink-gelly and then mvn verify. After it says build success, we're good to go. \n  Rebase and update the PR.\n\nIf you have questions, I'll be more than happy to answer them!  Nice job!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/110070080/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/110076740","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/796#issuecomment-110076740","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/796","id":110076740,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExMDA3Njc0MA==","user":{"login":"mxm","id":837221,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNzIyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/837221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm","html_url":"https://github.com/mxm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-08T17:09:08Z","updated_at":"2015-06-08T17:09:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you!

However, it comes at the cost of doing two passes over the data and temping the data after the first map because you need to wait for the count before you can assign IDs. Temping data means writing to and reading from disk if you process a lot of data.\nMy approach won't give sequential IDs but works in a pipelined fashion with a single Mapper and without temping. For each parallel task, you create an ID based on its index and a counter that starts at 0. These are the two components from which a record ID is created by shifting the counter by the number of bits you need for the task ID which is log2 of the number of tasks. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/110276236/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/110350898","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/804#issuecomment-110350898","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/804","id":110350898,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExMDM1MDg5OA==","user":{"login":"mbalassi","id":5990983,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5OTA5ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5990983?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi","html_url":"https://github.com/mbalassi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-09T13:04:01Z","updated_at":"2015-06-09T13:04:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks good now, we should not really test the ordering there anyway.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/110350898/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/110380728","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/807#issuecomment-110380728","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/807","id":110380728,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExMDM4MDcyOA==","user":{"login":"shghatge","id":6418348,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MTgzNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6418348?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shghatge","html_url":"https://github.com/shghatge","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shghatge/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shghatge/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shghatge/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shghatge/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shghatge/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shghatge/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shghatge/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shghatge/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shghatge/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-09T14:33:09Z","updated_at":"2015-06-09T14:33:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @fhueske I am sorry for closing the pull request.
