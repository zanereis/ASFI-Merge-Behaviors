However I'm still confused with the faq. No clear clue to the reset of start_date.\nSo I did some search in the source code `airflow/jobs.py`. From this piece of code in 'SchedulerJob. schedule_dag'\n\n```\n                if latest_run:\n                    # Migrating from previous version\n                    # make the past 5 runs active\n                    next_run_date = dag.date_range(latest_run, -5)[0]\n                else:\n                    next_run_date = min([t.start_date for t in dag.tasks])\n```\n\nIt seems that only clearing the history of dag runs' and task instances' can force the scheduler to use the `start_date` updated. And it works!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/198177631/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/198228903","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1160#issuecomment-198228903","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1160","id":198228903,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5ODIyODkwMw==","user":{"login":"r39132","id":581734,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MTczNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/581734?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132","html_url":"https://github.com/r39132","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-18T06:37:37Z","updated_at":"2016-03-18T06:37:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think I have a fix -

I'm misunderstanding the issue, but XCom values are totally arbitrary and it's up to the user to determine how they are pushed/pulled and interpreted. Therefore, I'm not sure much extra work has to be done to support the handle approach.\n\nFor example, extend `HiveOperator` to create and return the handle:\n\n``` python\nclass MyHiveOperator(HiveOperator):\n    def execute(self, context):\n        # do the normal execution\n        super().execute(context)\n        # then push the handle, whatever it might be\n        return make_handle()\n```\n\nThen build a `PythonOperator` (or `BranchPythonOperator`) that pulls the handle, uses it to check a (potentially) more complex result, and continue appropriate.\n\n``` python\ndef fn(context):\n    handle = context['task_instance'].xcom_pull(task_ids='my_hive_operator')\n    result = do_something(handle)\n    if result:\n        send_email()\n    else:\n        dont_send_email()\n    return handle\nPythonOperator(python_callable=fn)\n```\n\nTo replicate Luigi-style targets, the HiveOperator could return (for example) an s3 path to a `_success` file. The PythonOperator could use that path to check for the file.\n\nIf the consensus is that this is a useful pattern, but the xcom implementation is a bottleneck due to complexity (especially because it requires the subclass boilerplate) then maybe we can look at decorators that make it easier to push/pull values (but don't make any demands about what those values are!). For example:\n\n``` python\nmy_first_op = xcom_push_decorator(HiveOperator(), fn_that_defines_push)\nmy_second_op = xcom_pull_decorator(PythonOperator(), my_first_op)\n```\n\nI think the proof is that I wrote the XCom interface and I still had to go look it up just now :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/198621422/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/198693923","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1170#issuecomment-198693923","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1170","id":198693923,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5ODY5MzkyMw==","user":{"login":"landscape-bot","id":10010231,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDEwMjMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10010231?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/landscape-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-19T12:24:59Z","updated_at":"2016-03-19T12:24:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[![Code
