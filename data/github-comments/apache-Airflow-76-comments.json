the beta is a branch: v1-8-test . It tracks master currently although manually (so it allows for cherry picking if necessary, but I rather avoid it for non stable). In principle I am positive that anyone can merge from master to this branch, although with the caveat that large changes should be avoided. I would prefer bug fixes that don't change a contract go in easily (eg. by anyone). Fixes that do change o contract or new features left to the release manager or discussed on the mailing list. In other words this branch is a little bit more controlled/managed\r\n\r\nWhen we hit RC I will branch off v1-8-stable, which is quite fixed and only signed off patches should enter.

Now that airflow is a project under the Apache Incubator umbrella, all files need to have the following license at the top, or a compatible license : \r\n```\r\n# Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\n# you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\n# You may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n#\r\n# http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n#\r\n# Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\n# distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n# WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\n# See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\n# limitations under the License.\r\n#\r\n```\r\nRat is a script that checks license compatibility, and that we have integrated to our travis checks. It sometimes complains when more files are added as the number of files without a license must decrease.\r\nWhile I do not think we can relicense some of those files, I think we can exclude some. \r\nI think you should add the following to https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/blob/master/.rat-excludes : \r\n`airflow/www/static/coverage/*`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/274234622/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/274237776","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2007#issuecomment-274237776","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2007","id":274237776,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NDIzNzc3Ng==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-21T05:27:28Z","updated_at":"2017-01-21T05:27:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## [Current coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2007?src=pr) is 66.93% (diff: 100%)\n> Merging [#2007](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2007?src=pr) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/branch/master?src=pr) will increase coverage by **0.02%**\n\n```diff\n@@             master      #2007   diff @@\n==========================================\n  Files           138        138          \n  Lines         10531      10531          \n  Methods           0          0          \n  Messages          0          0          \n  Branches          0          0          \n==========================================\n+ Hits           7046       7049     +3   \n+ Misses         3485       3482     -3   \n  Partials          0          0          \n```\n\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io?src=pr).
