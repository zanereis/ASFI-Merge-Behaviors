In the UI I see \"An unexpected error has occurred\nAn error occurred communicating with the application core. Please check the logs and fix any configuration issues before restarting.\"\n\nIn the logs I see the huge stack trace below that includes viewing and clearing state (I never was able to click clear state though). \n\nAnother problem related to a misconfigured processor. I tried running a GetKafka that I accidentally had pointed to the wrong ZK cluster (my NiFi ZK instead of Kafka's ZK). It came up with bulletins, and when I viewed the state it came back with the same \"unexpected error\" but also changed the ScheduledState of the non-primary nodes to STOPPED while the primary node stayed RUNNING. This caused my primary to then be kicked out of the cluster because it had a different flow than the rest.\n\n2016-08-01 15:21:09,609 WARN [Replicate Request Thread-5]

My configuration is as follows:\n- 1 standalone nifi server with a Processor Group and an output port\n- A 2 node cluster with a Processor Group containing an input port and a Remote Processor Group that points to the standalone server\n\nThe goal of the test was to ensure that if an attempt is made to create a new connection from the Remote Processor Group to the Processor Group on the cluster, and the output port on the standalone (remote pg) is removed just before the add, then the system will display/log IllegalArgumentException (specifically related to the source not found).\n\nDuring my tests the behavior has been mostly the following:\n\n1) A NullPointerException occurs just before the verifyCreate method in StandardConnectionDAO is called\n2) If the port is removed a few seconds before creating a connection then the connection is created successfully with no logged errors.\n\nBoth errors prevented me from testing that IllegalArgumentExceptions would be thrown in this case (since the nullpointer exception happened \n\nAttached are snapshots of the nifi-user.log with the nullpointer exception that occurred on several of the runs.\n\nIs this test a feasible one and appropriate for this case?

When attempting to run the SiteToSiteProvenanceReporterTask on a single node setup (attempting to report to a cluster) I did not have the site to site port set, so the task attempted to log a warning. In the process it received an IllegalAccessException when it was attempting to use the getLogger parent method to obtain a logger to log the warning.  That causes setup to fail and the reporter to not execute (see attached log).   I think changing the code in AbstractSiteToSiteReportingTask.java (starting at line 115) to use a locally declared logger variable defaulted using the getLogger() method will help (e.g. declaring  final ComponentLog logger = getLogger(); and using logger in the EventReporter). Here is the current code with suggested changes in comments:\n\n```\n//suggest to add \n//final ComponentLog logger = getLogger();\n\n final EventReporter eventReporter = new EventReporter() {\n            @Override\n            public void reportEvent(final Severity severity, final String category, final String message) {\n                switch (severity) {\n                    case WARNING:\n                        getLogger().warn(message); //suggest change to logger.warn(message);\n                        break;\n                    case ERROR:\n                        getLogger().error(message); //suggest change to logger.error(message);\n                        break;\n                    default:\n                        break;\n                }\n            }\n        };\n\n```\n\nWhen the SiteToSite port value was set on the cluster, communication occurred as expected and the contentURI in the captured json appears in the format expected. (e.g. http://localhost:8080/nifi-api ).\n\nAttached are pictures of the error:\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"sitetositeloggererror\"

(warning or error) it causes the setup to fail.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/236838639/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/236884750","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/764#issuecomment-236884750","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/764","id":236884750,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNjg4NDc1MA==","user":{"login":"mcgilman","id":123395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzM5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman","html_url":"https://github.com/mcgilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-02T12:08:15Z","updated_at":"2016-08-02T12:08:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Reviewing...\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/236884750/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/236885239","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/764#issuecomment-236885239","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/764","id":236885239,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNjg4NTIzOQ==","user":{"login":"mcgilman","id":123395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzM5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman","html_url":"https://github.com/mcgilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-02T12:10:35Z","updated_at":"2016-08-02T12:10:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks

The results returned to the client are correct based on the per-node authorizer checks performed at the time of the query.  Using the AbstractPolicyBasedAuthorizer, this case will not occur, since the policies are forced to be in sync across the cluster.

update is looking good... one thing I noticed, if you send in an Avro file that does not have the partition columns of the table, it throws an IOException around line 435 when trying to extract the partition fields from the Avro schema, but then it gets wrapped in a ProcessException and thrown out of onTrigger so the flow file sits in the incoming queue but can never be processed. \n\nCould we look for ProcessException with a cause of IOException and route to failure (similar to the connection error handling)? or maybe create a specific exception type to look for since there could be other IOExceptions that we want to bounce out of onTrigger?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/236992223/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/236995053","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/706#issuecomment-236995053","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/706","id":236995053,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNjk5NTA1Mw==","user":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-02T18:21:44Z","updated_at":"2016-08-02T18:21:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yes

I think this is actually a JDK bug. I'm about 99% sure that the anonymous inner class _should_ be able to access that method. And if it can't, it should be a compile-time error not a runtime error. In fact, the Javadocs for that error even explicitly say:\n\n> Normally, this error is caught by the compiler; this error can only occur at run time if the definition of a class has incompatibly changed.\n\nI'm quite certain that the definition of the class has not changed. In any event, I believe the proposed solution is a reasonable one, so I implemented it and pushed a new commit. I also addressed your other feedback by making the URI path a constant. Good call.\n\nThanks for taking the time to review this. Let me know if you run into anything else.

Started up the server normally and was able to access the application.  I then added another user in NiFi (using a DN from a different cert) just to have more than one to try.  I later went back to the server, shutdown NiFi and removed the authorizations.xml file to ensure that file would be regenerated and left the users file in place.  \n\nOn startup I saw that the authorizations.xml file was created yet empty (with only open and closed authorizations tags). This led to my previously authorized user (set as Initial Admin Identity) no longer able to access the application. Is this expected behavior?  My thoughts were that if a user was in the initial admin identify then NiFi would at least restore that reference.  Stopping and deleting the user's file restores the authorizations as it was on initial startup (with authorizations created with the initial admin identity).\n\nOn debug of the FileAuthorizer it appears as if the emptyAuthorizations variable (ln 260) is actually returning false. On inspection of  the authorizationsHolder variable you can see the policy set is empty so I'm not sure why the isEmpty() call resolves to false.  However it is preventing the if emptyAuthorizations conditional block to execute, which I think is the intended behavior for this case.\n\n```\nfinal AuthorizationsHolder authorizationsHolder = new AuthorizationsHolder(authorizations, tenants);\nfinal boolean emptyAuthorizations = authorizationsHolder.getAllPolicies().isEmpty(); //this returns false\n```\n\nI've included a snapshot of this behavior in debug mode.  Ironically when using IntelliJ's evaluate expression feature it resolves to true however at runtime it resolves to false #nobueno. \n\n![emptyauthorizers](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1371858/17353128/d7bf5068-590a-11e6-8f96-be1801e35a4f.png)\n\nAs a side note, while debugging I saw an interesting area of code which feels like it may cause side effects.  This is in the Policies.java:\n\n```\n    public List<Policy> getPolicy() {\n        if (policy == null) {\n            policy = new ArrayList<Policy>();\n        }\n        return this.policy;\n    }\n```\n\nAnd this line of code is in AuthorizationsHolder.java (ln. 111 - 113)\n\n```\n      Set<AccessPolicy> allPolicies = new HashSet<>();\n        if (policies == null || policies.getPolicy() == null) {\n            return allPolicies;\n        }\n```\n\nSo in the case where I was testing the empty authorizations issue, when executing the AuthorizationsHolder.createAccessPolicies method the incoming policies object would not be null but the policy list member attribute it contained would be null until it hit the above  conditional.  When getPolicy is called it actually returns a list instead of null leading to the condition resolving as false.  Since it's an empty list it doesn't evaluate the subsequent for-loop but it still appeared to me as strange behavior (which I figured had some reason behind it).   Since Policies isn't extended anywhere to allow setting of that policy member, I suggest to remove the policies.getPolicy() == null from that condition since it doesn't appear that it would ever resolve to true. If the Policies getPolicy code could be refactored I think that would be more optimal.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/237130483/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/237227997","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/727#issuecomment-237227997","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/727","id":237227997,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNzIyNzk5Nw==","user":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-03T12:50:22Z","updated_at":"2016-08-04T14:11:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I see a few comments about PutHiveStreaming, that is part of a previous commit that is being handled under #706, it's just in here in order to inherit the downgrade of Hive.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/237227997/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/237231580","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/690#issuecomment-237231580","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/690","id":237231580,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNzIzMTU4MA==","user":{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-03T13:06:34Z","updated_at":"2016-08-03T13:06:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@YolandaMDavis I will look into the NPE.

with the new password. \n\n```\nhw12203:/Users/alopresto/Workspace/certificates (master) alopresto\n🔓 339s @ 09:48:48 $ keytool -keypasswd -new newBadKeyPassword -keystore diffpass.keystore -storepass

throwing an `UnrecoverableKeyException` when attempting to validate the service properties, so somewhere it is attempting to use the incorrect password to access the key. \n\n![screen shot 2016-08-03
