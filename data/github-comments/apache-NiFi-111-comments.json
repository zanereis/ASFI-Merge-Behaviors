So this would confirm my suggestion to remove the lookEmail() function; beside the work-around for #NIFI-4698.\r\n\r\nYou're right about the required scope. Only the **openid** scope is required to be sent when requesting the token. But NiFi is highly dependent on the existence of the email value. Otherwise NiFi could not verify the user that wants to log in.\r\nSo what would happen if the user requests the **email** scope and the IDP won't support it? If the request really throws an exception or simply doesn't return the email value? An exception is caught by the try-catch block, an empty email value would lead to a request to the userinfo endpoint, that probably will also have no result, thus the user cannot login to NiFi (using this IDP). So the selected IDP might be not the correct choice.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/481123464/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/481137085","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3276#issuecomment-481137085","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3276","id":481137085,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MTEzNzA4NQ==","user":{"login":"k0urge","id":27643232,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NjQzMjMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27643232?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k0urge","html_url":"https://github.com/k0urge","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k0urge/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k0urge/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k0urge/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k0urge/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k0urge/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k0urge/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k0urge/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k0urge/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k0urge/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-09T07:33:12Z","updated_at":"2019-04-09T07:33:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @ijokarumawak for the new role !","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/481137085/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/481139130","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3398#issuecomment-481139130","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3398","id":481139130,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MTEzOTEzMA==","user":{"login":"SimonLinder","id":48946566,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4OTQ2NTY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48946566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonLinder","html_url":"https://github.com/SimonLinder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonLinder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonLinder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonLinder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonLinder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonLinder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonLinder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonLinder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonLinder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonLinder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-09T07:39:56Z","updated_at":"2019-04-09T07:39:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@mcgilman Sorry, did some wired GIT stuff, because I accidentally pushed stuff to a branch \"nifi-6171\", but I wanted to use \"NIFI-6171\".

I could certainly submit a different PR targeting an improvement to `SplitJson`, but there were a few reasons I thought a different processor might be better:\r\n\r\n1. The `SplitLargeJson` processor is designed to always output complete JSON documents.  This differs from the `SplitJson` behavior.  For example, when splitting an array of strings, `SplitJson` would output `String1`, `String2`, etc, but `SplitLargeJson` would output `[\"String1\"]`, `[\"String2\"]`, etc.  This can be advantageous when the output relation (the split-relation) is directed to another processor that expects JSON.\r\n2. The `SplitJson` processor can only split arrays.  The JSON Path must target an array in the document.  However, `SplitLargeJson` can split arrays _and_ objects.  If the JSON Path points to an object then it will output all the key-value pairs of that object in separate flowfiles.\r\n3. The `SplitJson` processor sets a `fragment.count` attribute on outgoing flowfiles to indicate the total number of documents that were split from the designated JSON Path.  This is by nature impossible when using a sax-like (streaming) approach to reading the JSON because the processor is designed to avoid loading the whole document into memory at the same time.  Therefore, in order to preserve the current function, a setting would need to be added to optionally engage the optimized handling for large files -- with a stated caveat that the `fragment.count` attribute would be unavailable.\r\n\r\nAgain, I could submit a different pull request that targets an optimization of `SplitJson` rather than an addition of a new `SplitLargeJson` processor.  I started down that path originally, with a boolean setting to optionally activate large file processing (and in that mode it could also split objects, provided the JSON Path was not \"overly complex\" [i.e. require backtracking, etc]) -- but then I had to change the processor to occasionally output non-json documents which made the code less elegant.  That said, I could see the value in sticking with one processor.\r\n\r\nAs for JsonSurfer, I had honestly never heard of it.  My code here was from a work project I did a couple years ago that was finally approved for release to the public.  I could probably make a change to `SplitJson` that employs JsonSurfer... I'm bummed my code isn't as novel as I'd hoped, but I know that's how things go!\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think is best.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/481294396/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/481295640","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3420#issuecomment-481295640","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3420","id":481295640,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MTI5NTY0MA==","user":{"login":"bbende","id":605416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTQxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende","html_url":"https://github.com/bbende","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-09T15:16:05Z","updated_at":"2019-04-09T15:16:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks

It probably doesn't hurt but I don't know that we really gain much either. In terms of code reuse, I think we can easily accomplish that in other ways, perhaps with an abstract class or helper methods. A change that makes a flow invalid is pretty much a last resort. If there were some sort of security vulnerability or something like that, or if we find that we're doing something egregious to the server side then it would make sense to consider the change.\r\n\r\nCan you explain your third thought there, regarding CDC operations? Can you outline the use case where this helps? As you're describing it, I think such a race condition could still exist.

I just tried the PR against the mitreid-connect IdP [1] and it is exhibiting the same behavior that I recall seeing during the initial development of this capability. The token request that we perform to get the id and access token return successfully. However, despite the presence of the `email` scope the id token does not necessarily contain the claims that correspond to the authorized scopes. It does, however, as you pointed out, make those claims available via subsequent calls to the UserInfo endpoint. \r\n\r\nLooking at the spec for the id token [2] it appears that the id token may contain additional claims. I think that is what we're seeing with the Google Idp and possibly the implementation you're using. I think we need to retain the `lookupEmail` method to restore the capabilities for implementations that do not include additional claims in the token response.\r\n\r\nI propose the following:\r\n\r\n1) Always include both `openid` and `email` scopes.\r\n2) Remove unnecessary checks for scopes in the constructor.\r\n3) Retain `lookupEmail` for invoking the UserInfo endpoint.\r\n\r\nI'd also like to get your opinion on optionally introducing the following:\r\n\r\n4) Add a property to `nifi.properties` to allow the nifi admin to configure additional scopes (e.g. `profile`). These would be included in addition to `openid` and `email`.\r\n5) Add a property to `nifi.properties` to allow the nifi admin to configure the claim that we should use to identify the user. This would allow folks to configure any claim to identify the user and not be dependent on `email`. This property would default to `email` to retain backward compatibility. However, the nifi admin could ultimately choose any claim as long as it was available through the configured scopes.\r\n\r\nThese changes should be pretty straight forward and I am happy to review if you're interested in contributing them too. If not, I can file follow on JIRAs for these improvements. \r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/mitreid-connect/OpenID-Connect-Java-Spring-Server\r\n[2] https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDToken","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/481799434/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/481808739","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3428#issuecomment-481808739","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3428","id":481808739,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MTgwODczOQ==","user":{"login":"mcgilman","id":123395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzM5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman","html_url":"https://github.com/mcgilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-10T18:29:10Z","updated_at":"2019-04-10T18:29:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @mattyb149 and @rfellows!

time.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/482096603/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/482104902","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3351#issuecomment-482104902","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3351","id":482104902,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MjEwNDkwMg==","user":{"login":"moranr","id":14202495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjAyNDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14202495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/moranr","html_url":"https://github.com/moranr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moranr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moranr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moranr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moranr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moranr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moranr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moranr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moranr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moranr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-11T13:02:52Z","updated_at":"2019-04-11T13:02:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ijokarumawak

patch.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/482339547/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/482423836","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3426#issuecomment-482423836","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3426","id":482423836,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MjQyMzgzNg==","user":{"login":"jtstorck","id":19271493,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjcxNDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19271493?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck","html_url":"https://github.com/jtstorck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-12T03:30:42Z","updated_at":"2019-04-12T03:30:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@thenatog

So it shouldn't contain any UUID or Timestamp ... etc such values changing when the processor starts\r\n    - We may want to store the generated value into NiFi Managed State (Local) if we support these type of values to be used as transactional.id\r\n- Unique per NiFi node (or even per Processor, if writing to the same topic from different processor instances). Having the same transactional.id with more than 1 NiFi node would cause issue.\r\n\r\nIf above understanding is correct, I would configure it as: `my-nifi-cluster-${hostname}-processor-id`. Will it be a reasonable configuration for its purpose?\r\nIf so, I think we should add that to the processor property's description as an good example value.\r\n\r\nUmm, it seems it's difficult to configure the value from a user's standing point.\r\nI prefer the processor generate a UUID when it starts at the first time, then store it into its local state, then reuse it when it restart later.\r\n\r\nHow do you think??","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/484794485/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/484987500","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3436#issuecomment-484987500","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3436","id":484987500,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NDk4NzUwMA==","user":{"login":"natural","id":146692,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NjY5Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/146692?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/natural","html_url":"https://github.com/natural","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natural/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natural/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natural/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natural/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natural/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natural/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natural/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natural/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natural/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-19T19:01:45Z","updated_at":"2019-04-19T19:01:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"In the process of writing the unit test, I found the processor would throw exceptions after the property was removed:\r\n\r\n```2019-04-19 10:49:57,346 ERROR [Timer-Driven Process Thread-5] o.a.nifi.processors.standard.InvokeHTTP InvokeHTTP[id=32f7cf9e-016a-1000-f0e2-d2a3d2b2dbb5] Yielding processor due to exception encountered as a source processor: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Unexpected char 0x20 at 7 in header name: Trusted Hostname: {}\r\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Unexpected char 0x20 at 7 in header name: Trusted Hostname\r\n        at okhttp3.Headers$Builder.checkNameAndValue(Headers.java:313)\r\n        at okhttp3.Headers$Builder.add(Headers.java:271)\r\n        at okhttp3.Request$Builder.addHeader(Request.java:177)\r\n        at org.apache.nifi.processors.standard.InvokeHTTP.setHeaderProperties(InvokeHTTP.java:1008)\r\n        at org.apache.nifi.processors.standard.InvokeHTTP.configureRequest(InvokeHTTP.java:970)\r\n        at org.apache.nifi.processors.standard.InvokeHTTP.onTrigger(InvokeHTTP.java:761)\r\n        at org.apache.nifi.processor.AbstractProcessor.onTrigger(AbstractProcessor.java:27)\r\n        at org.apache.nifi.controller.StandardProcessorNode.onTrigger(StandardProcessorNode.java:1162)\r\n        at org.apache.nifi.controller.tasks.ConnectableTask.invoke(ConnectableTask.java:213)\r\n        at org.apache.nifi.controller.scheduling.TimerDrivenSchedulingAgent$1.run(TimerDrivenSchedulingAgent.java:117)\r\n        at org.apache.nifi.engine.FlowEngine$2.run(FlowEngine.java:110)\r\n        at java.util.concurrent.Executors$RunnableAdapter.call(Executors.java:511)\r\n        at java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.runAndReset(FutureTask.java:308)\r\n        at java.util.concurrent.ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor$ScheduledFutureTask.access$301(ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.java:180)\r\n        at java.util.concurrent.ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor$ScheduledFutureTask.run(ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.java:294)\r\n        at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1149)\r\n        at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:624)\r\n        at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:748)\r\n```\r\nThe error seems clear enough:  the property is treated as a dynamic property after this change, and the processor tries to send it as a header.

I could add more detail there, or is there a better place where I should expound on the function of the processor?\r\n\r\nAlso, as I mentioned in [an above comment](https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3414#issuecomment-482096603), I think there are four roads we could take from here:\r\n\r\n1) Create a new `SplitJsonProcessor` that uses `javax.json` (this PR)\r\n2) Create a new `SplitJsonProcessor` that uses `JsonSurfer`\r\n3) Keep only `SplitJson` and optionally employ a streaming approach, backed by `javax.json`, when a new property is set\r\n4) Keep only `SplitJson` and optionally employ a streaming approach, backed by `JsonSurfer`, when a new property is set\r\n\r\nI looked briefly into the 2nd and 4th option but have yet to confirm whether the memory usage is comparable.  In order to use `JsonSurfer` in NiFi it looks like we'd need to suppress the version of ANTLR that is pulled from the [nifi-syslog-utils](https://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/master/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-extension-utils/nifi-syslog-utils/pom.xml#L28) module (via `simple-syslog-5424`) and explicitly replace it with `4.7.2` of `antlr4-runtime`.  After I did that, I was able to run `JsonSurfer` without a runtime error.\r\n\r\n`JsonSurfer` does have wider support for the JSON Path specification.  If we went that route, I'd suggest we create a new processor called \"JsonExtract\", or something, that would simply receive a JSON file and a JSON Path.  It would output zero, one, or more JSON documents from the incoming document.  The notion of \"splitting\" isn't really the best description at that point, since the full JSON Path specification can be used to specify any part -- or set of parts -- of a JSON document.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/485135173/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
