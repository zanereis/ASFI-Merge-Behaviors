be honest, I don't see it being that big of a deal. Both profiles take about 5 minutes each which I think is fairly short, since up until recently we were spending 4 minutes just installing the R dependencies for all of the other profiles. Additionally, this would make it much easier to test everything for both python 2 and 3, which can be quite a pain to do manually with conda / virtualenv (eg, fiddling with the PATH before running tests for each case). Also, matplotlib and pandas are most likely used for a large percentage of python / pyspark use cases in Zeppelin, so I think having that integration tested would be really useful.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/262887654/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/262891154","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1677#issuecomment-262891154","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1677","id":262891154,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2Mjg5MTE1NA==","user":{"login":"zjffdu","id":164491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu","html_url":"https://github.com/zjffdu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-25T06:47:43Z","updated_at":"2016-11-25T06:47:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I mean we can internally do this in `PyZeppelinContext` as following:\r\n```\r\ndef __setitem__(self, key, item):\r\n    if isinstance(item, DataFrame):\r\n       self.z.put(key, item._jdf)\r\n    else:\r\n       self.z.put(key, item)\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/262891154/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/262891573","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1612#issuecomment-262891573","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1612","id":262891573,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2Mjg5MTU3Mw==","user":{"login":"zjffdu","id":164491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu","html_url":"https://github.com/zjffdu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-25T06:51:38Z","updated_at":"2016-11-25T06:51:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@felixcheung @prabhjyotsingh @Leemoonsoo  Please help review.
