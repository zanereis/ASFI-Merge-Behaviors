Also needs people's thoughts. cc @aokolnychyi , @RussellSpitzer , @rdblue ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/816121533/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/816263279","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/2373#issuecomment-816263279","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2373","id":816263279,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxNjI2MzI3OQ==","user":{"login":"yeshvantbhavnasi","id":20260478,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMjYwNDc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20260478?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshvantbhavnasi","html_url":"https://github.com/yeshvantbhavnasi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshvantbhavnasi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshvantbhavnasi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshvantbhavnasi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshvantbhavnasi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshvantbhavnasi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshvantbhavnasi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshvantbhavnasi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshvantbhavnasi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshvantbhavnasi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-08T22:10:15Z","updated_at":"2021-04-08T22:10:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"We can use the `RewriteManifest` api on spark which will use the rotated kms master key.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/816263279/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/816337252","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2354#issuecomment-816337252","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2354","id":816337252,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxNjMzNzI1Mg==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-09T01:25:41Z","updated_at":"2021-04-09T01:25:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jackye1995, looking at this, I think that we can simplify it quite a bit since we are no longer tracking multiple versions of the identifier fields.\r\n\r\nI started by looking at `RowKeyIdentifierField`, which is basically an `Integer`, then at `RowKey`, which is basically a `Collection<Integer>` or `Set<Integer>`. I think that we can remove those two classes fairly easily. Next, this requires quite a few API changes to expose the row key along side a schema, when I think most SQL tables consider those part of the same thing. If we also consider the identifier fields to be part of the schema, then we no longer need so many changes.\r\n\r\nFor example, we can reuse the `UpdateSchema` operation to set the schema's identifier fields, `setIdentifierFields(String...)`. We can also expose `Schema.identifierFieldIds()` to access them. Not requiring a new operation on `Table` or modifying `TableMetadata` is a plus. But it also makes sense to do this: then we could have a single operation that adds `profile_id` and also adds it to the table's identifier fields at the same time.\r\n\r\nCombining the identifier fields with schema also causes them to be versioned with schema -- we'd need to update `Schema` so that the identifier fields are part of equality -- but then we would be able to detect cases like @openinx raised. While we wouldn't roll back the schema/identifier update at the same time as the snapshot without a transaction, this would allow us to easily detect that the bad snapshot used the updated identifier, or detect which snapshots in a table used an updated identifier.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/816337252/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/816362459","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/2442#issuecomment-816362459","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2442","id":816362459,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxNjM2MjQ1OQ==","user":{"login":"RussellSpitzer","id":413025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/413025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer","html_url":"https://github.com/RussellSpitzer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-09T02:47:09Z","updated_at":"2021-04-09T02:47:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"From the docs\r\n\r\n```\r\nAdd the Iceberg Hive Runtime jar file to the Hive classpath¶\r\nRegardless of the table type, the HiveIcebergStorageHandler and supporting classes need to be made available on Hive’s classpath.

For the purposes of this documentation we will assume that the table is called table_b and that the table location is s3://some_path/table_b. In order for Iceberg to correctly set up the Hive table for querying some configuration values need to be set, the two options for this are described below - you can use either or the other depending on your use case.\r\n\r\nHive Configuration¶\r\nThe value iceberg.engine.hive.enabled needs to be set to true and added to the Hive configuration file on the classpath of the application creating or modifying (altering, inserting etc.) the table. This can be done by modifying the relevant hive-site.xml. Alternatively this can be done programmatically like so:\r\n\r\nConfiguration hadoopConfiguration = spark.sparkContext().hadoopConfiguration();\r\nhadoopConfiguration.set(ConfigProperties.ENGINE_HIVE_ENABLED, \"true\"); //iceberg.engine.hive.enabled=true\r\nHiveCatalog catalog = new HiveCatalog(hadoopConfiguration);\r\n...\r\ncatalog.createTable(tableId, schema, spec);\r\nTable Property Configuration¶\r\nThe property engine.hive.enabled needs to be set to true and added to the table properties when creating the Iceberg table. This can be done like so:\r\n\r\n    Map<String, String> tableProperties = new HashMap<String, String>();\r\n    tableProperties.put(TableProperties.ENGINE_HIVE_ENABLED, \"true\"); //engine.hive.enabled=true\r\n    catalog.createTable(tableId, schema, spec, tableProperties);\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/816381228/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/816408287","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/2442#issuecomment-816408287","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2442","id":816408287,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxNjQwODI4Nw==","user":{"login":"pvary","id":19705742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzA1NzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19705742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary","html_url":"https://github.com/pvary","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-09T05:09:14Z","updated_at":"2021-04-09T05:09:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"As a first try I would stick to the `add jar ...` solution.
