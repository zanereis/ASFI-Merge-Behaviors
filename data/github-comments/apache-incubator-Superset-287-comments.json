My thought would be to start whittling away react-bootstrap using custom components - at least where it's easy/pragmatic to do so, just to reduce reliance on that dependency.

Been wanting to address this for a while, so thank you. I have some questions/suggestions.\r\n\r\nHow should translation fit into this? Error messages are sometimes written to have dynamic values contained in them, such as `\"{input}\" is not a valid url`, or `{some_resource} is already in use`. Do we only allow static error messages? Is there a way for dynamic error messages to play well with the translation system? Dynamic error messages can often make a big difference in UX: it can be tricky to write static messages that accurately describe every situation where you might see the error.\r\n\r\nI lean towards a system where the text of the error message is defined entirely on the frontend, with the error object containing parameters with which to construct a message. It makes sense for the backend to supply an error message for debugging purposes, but that field should indicate that it's not meant to be used in UI.\r\n\r\nI'd also like form validation errors to have a standard schema, so that the frontend can display validation errors in the appropriate place in the UI. Since we seem to be going towards having an array of error objects, we could attach a `field_name` value to an error when it relates to a specific field. So if a hypothetical url field called `custom_url` was submitted with a bad value, you'd get back:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n \"errors\": [{\r\n    \"error_type\": \"INPUT_INVALID_URL\",\r\n    \"level\": \"error\",\r\n    \"debug_message\": \"Invalid url value for custom_url\",\r\n    \"field_name\": \"custom_url\",\r\n    \"message_params\": {\r\n      \"input\": \"https//notvalid\"\r\n    }\r\n  }]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n~Lastly, I could use some clarification: what's the purpose of allowing admins to override the renderer?~ Nevermind, I get it now - it's just for the generic messages, that makes sense.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/590599304/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/590609298","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/9190#issuecomment-590609298","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/9190","id":590609298,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5MDYwOTI5OA==","user":{"login":"DiggidyDave","id":1179026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkwMjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DiggidyDave","html_url":"https://github.com/DiggidyDave","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DiggidyDave/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DiggidyDave/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DiggidyDave/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DiggidyDave/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DiggidyDave/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DiggidyDave/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DiggidyDave/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DiggidyDave/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DiggidyDave/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-24T23:56:50Z","updated_at":"2020-02-24T23:56:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The bulk polling could make sense to reduce load, but my bigger point here is that scaling a fleet of HTTP servers (or even routing a particular endpoint to a distinct dedicated fleet) is a pretty simple problem that can be accomodated in most environments, whereas websockets and sidecars have a lot of interesting problems in that area and may not even be feasible in some environments.\r\n\r\nFor the last point, that sounds like a front-end bug, not a problem inherent with small HTTP GET requests for short polling.

That's why i'd prefer not to label it as `debug` since if it's not handled in any other way, we'd display this field. However, if you wanted to render a more specific component, you'd rely on the `error_type` passed and the content in `extra` to render it. I would envision that applying to form validation errors too. An InputValidationError would be a subtype of Error where error_type = `INPUT_VALIDATION_ERROR` and `extra` is defined as an object that must contain a `field_name` and a `message_params` attribute. This InputValidationError could also be defined on the backend so the extra field is guaranteed to match what's expected. Then you'd be able to get type safety on the front end as well.

If the user has a number of open tabs, we then have each client potentially hammering the metadata DB pretty hard. Contrast this with the websocket option (or SSE+HTTP/2), which requires a single authentication action upon connect, and a single authorization for each result set only when fetched.\r\n\r\nWebsockets are more work to setup at the infrastructure level, though there are similar concerns with enabling HTTP/2 in many load balancers, without which, SSE is not a viable option. My initial inclination when drafting this SIP was to recommend SSE+HTTP/2 rather than websockets, but the Flask app is not well suited for persistent connections, making a sidecar app more feasible. Websockets are also arguably more ubiquitous for realtime communication at the client at this point. With regard to scaling, the fact that sticky sessions are not required due to the reconnection strategy allows for flexible horizontal scaling of the websocket sidecar app, and there are several patterns for load balancing websocket servers. Are there specific scaling or implementation concerns that we should address?\r\n\r\nAsync query support is currently optional in Superset, and should remain so, IMO. The async solution we agree upon should be a balance of performance and feasibility, but we should consider short polling for a fallback if websockets are not available for whatever reason.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/591076741/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/591095450","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/9190#issuecomment-591095450","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/9190","id":591095450,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5MTA5NTQ1MA==","user":{"login":"DiggidyDave","id":1179026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkwMjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DiggidyDave","html_url":"https://github.com/DiggidyDave","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DiggidyDave/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DiggidyDave/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DiggidyDave/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DiggidyDave/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DiggidyDave/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DiggidyDave/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DiggidyDave/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DiggidyDave/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DiggidyDave/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-25T22:08:20Z","updated_at":"2020-02-25T22:08:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"For the metadata/auth load problem, could we just issue short-lived tokens for the session with cache to remove the need to hammer that database? (Decomposition into simple problems with simple solutions may be preferable)\r\n\r\nLast pushback on the bigger idea 😁: Websockets have their uses--for example, I've found them very useful in the past for things like streaming 60hz point cloud updates and telemetry data--but ultimately they are an RTC protocol and that is really not the situation we have here, and to me this feels like overkill. I concede it will get the job done, but I fear it will be unnecessarily \"expensive\", it will introduce complexity, it will introduce a host of new bugs and other fallout, and I think the infra/ops requirements may lead to reduced adoption in environments where there is friction to messing with LBs etc.\r\n\r\nI think I've said my 2 cents on that... **looking forward**, if the community agrees to go with WebSockets i would ask that the SIP be modified to account for these concerns and keep it enterprise friendly. A couple of requests for consideration:\r\n- **consider separating the dependency on websockets' interface from the transport layer** using something like socket.io, which has the nice property of being configurable to use the polling transport layer and avoiding the use of actual websockets\r\n- **reconsider using flask-socketio to avoid need for sidecar**: the SIP doesn't elaborate on why it is too invasive, but in my experience using `flask-socketio` it is very clean and is as simple as adding a route in flask to expose a websocket endpoint.  If architected thoughtfully (with some very light configuration on top), having flask endpoints exposing the websockets on top of socket.io would give users the flexibility to use a sidecar or not, and to use websockets or polling at their discretion.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/591095450/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/591151787","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/8655#issuecomment-591151787","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/8655","id":591151787,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5MTE1MTc4Nw==","user":{"login":"suddjian","id":1858430,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTg0MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1858430?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddjian","html_url":"https://github.com/suddjian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddjian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddjian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddjian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddjian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddjian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddjian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddjian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddjian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddjian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-26T00:03:56Z","updated_at":"2020-02-26T00:03:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I want to respond to questions raised in the Superset Meetup, and clarify the scope and purpose of this proposal.\r\n\r\nThis proposal is specifically about improving user experience by moving the tab implementation from the UI to the browser, and not about changing state management - though it does depend on the state management improvements from [SIP-23](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/7748). This should allow the same user productivity, while being a more modern and practical solution.\r\n\r\nBrowser tabs will allow for better support of upcoming features such as more powerful edit history/undo. Supporting unique URLs for each SQL Lab session will also unlock new use cases that are currently impossible. For example, if you close a tab in SQL Lab you can never get it back, but in this design, if you close a tab you simply have to get back to the same URL again.\r\n\r\nThis pattern was identified during the [redesign process](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/8976) as a better UX pattern than the current design. Participants were generally in favor of the change due to the improved usability, stability, and cleaner UI of browser tabs, as well as some positive user feedback.\r\n\r\nI’d like to get some more votes on this SIP in the email thread.

Using Socket.io without websockets would almost certainly saturate the browser's HTTP connection limit with just a few tabs open (without HTTP/2). This was the main reason behind recommending vanilla websockets vs Socket.io.\r\n\r\nI'm interested in hearing more about your experience with `flask-socketio`. Are you running this with `gunicorn` and `gevent`? This setup is [the current recommendation in the Superset docs](https://superset.incubator.apache.org/installation.html#a-proper-wsgi-http-server), but there are apparent incompatibilities with [database](https://www.psycopg.org/docs/advanced.html#green-support) [drivers](https://github.com/PyMySQL/mysqlclient-python/pull/285) and green threads. This lack of clarity around green thread support in Superset is another reason for recommending handling persistent connections in a separate application. I'd also be interested in hearing if others are using `gevent` or `eventlet` successfully in production.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/591168407/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/591224476","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/7739#issuecomment-591224476","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/7739","id":591224476,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5MTIyNDQ3Ng==","user":{"login":"ghosalya","id":12974269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTc0MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12974269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghosalya","html_url":"https://github.com/ghosalya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghosalya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghosalya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghosalya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghosalya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghosalya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghosalya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghosalya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghosalya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghosalya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-26T03:47:59Z","updated_at":"2020-02-26T03:47:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I

When I used it previously, we were using websockets (not long polling) on `gunicorn` and `gevent` but we were not using any datasources so I can't speak to that specifically. But we did have to actually write code on the server side to manage some concurrency issues (like explicitly sleeping to yield the processor in certain places to keep things moving) so it might make sense that some db drivers are not out-of-the-box compatible if running in the same process as the socket server.\r\n\r\nI know I said I had said my 2 cents, but a couple more questions came to mind (sorry!):\r\n- are \"many tabs\" really a problem? do we need to be polling/streaming events constantly for inactive tabs? If only the 1-3 (for power users with big desktops with side by side windows) active tabs a user will have are the ones we care about, could we only actively short-poll on those active tabs (using page visibility apis)? upon switching tabs, a quick single, first poll request will see if results have come in for the new tab and cause them to be immediately fetched\r\n- if the above is true: if polling is active only for active tabs, and batched for dashboards, what are the remaining problems that require websockets?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/591235866/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/591247102","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/347#issuecomment-591247102","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/347","id":591247102,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5MTI0NzEwMg==","user":{"login":"gogitub","id":61489253,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxNDg5MjUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61489253?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogitub","html_url":"https://github.com/gogitub","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogitub/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogitub/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogitub/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogitub/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogitub/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogitub/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogitub/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogitub/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gogitub/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-26T05:32:23Z","updated_at":"2020-02-26T05:32:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Any inputs on Drilldown option?

The one that's on by default is provided by [Flask-WTF](https://flask-wtf.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), this is the one currently used when username/pw auth is configured. When using flask-wtf the csrf if provided via a jinja function (meant to be inserted in the DOM). When using  [flask-jwt-extended](https://flask-jwt-extended.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) the csrf if provided in a cookie and it should match what's in the jwt payload. \r\n\r\nThis PR adds functionality to default to using the CSRF token provided by flask-wtf, however if that is disabled (via a config flag) and doesn't exist in the DOM, then we check the presence of the token in the cookie. This allows for both methods of checking CSRF. If both methods are enabled (they shouldn't be) then it'll default to flask-wtf token.

On the other hand, there are two potential issues that jump to the top of my mind: 1) this is a step away from having an ecosystem of plugins from 3rd party repos, and 2) I _think_ that one of the reasons these were moved to their own repo in the first place had to do with isolating the licenses of certain packages from the core Apache release. I worry that this'll be another difficult thing to unwind later, but concede that it may make life easier for today.

You're correct, that's different from SQL Lab tabs - @mistercrunch misunderstood.\r\n\r\nLet me answer some questions for you:\r\n\r\n### Why isn't the content of all dashboard tabs written to the DOM?\r\nFor each chart on a dashboard, the front-end currently makes an HTTP request for the relevant data after load. Browsers limit concurrent requests to the same domain to 6 at one time. This means that we can, at most, load data for 6 charts concurrently. Writing charts to the DOM for only the current tab is a performance optimization which ensures:\r\n\r\n1. All requests are for the tab the user wants to look at right now\r\n1. Charts which the user does not choose to view are not unnecessarily loaded\r\n\r\nPoint 2 is especially important for large dashboards accessing data on congested databases - it's quite possible for Superset to overwhelm a back-end store if too many people hit it at once.\r\n\r\n### Why was it built this way?\r\nI don't have the full history, but I believe this was the easiest way to build the system in the beginning. The project is currently exploring removing some of the bottlenecks by backgrounding queries and leveraging websockets. This should remove the limit of 6 charts loading at once.\r\n\r\n### Recommendation for you\r\nOne way to get around the restriction would be to export the dashboard via either a headed or headless browser using a tool like Selenium - you could code a script to click to open each tab, wait for all the API requests to complete, and then snapshot the DOM. This is likely a slower and more difficult-to-configure snapshot than what you were looking for, but I believe it would work.\r\n\r\nWhy are you looking to export dashboard data via the web interface? What is your use-case? Understanding this could assist me in helping you meet the need.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/593681182/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/593704224","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/9207#issuecomment-593704224","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/9207","id":593704224,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5MzcwNDIyNA==","user":{"login":"rusackas","id":812905,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMjkwNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/812905?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas","html_url":"https://github.com/rusackas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-03T00:32:17Z","updated_at":"2020-03-03T00:32:17Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@etr2460 I shared this concern as I was implementing this... in fact I went down a rabbit hole of writing LESS conditional mixins to only load the `@font-face`s that were actually in use. In the end though, it turns out every browser since IE8 is smart enough to NOT load `@font-face` resources that aren't actually in use. So, I added all the font binaries to the repo in case they come in handy, but in actuality, only three of the weights, and one of the formats, might ever actually get loaded. Usually only a couple of those are actually in use by a given view, and they do appear to be cached from what I saw. So despite all the font binaries visible in this PR, the burden on load is actually pretty light.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/593704224/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/593708451","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/9207#issuecomment-593708451","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/9207","id":593708451,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5MzcwODQ1MQ==","user":{"login":"etr2460","id":7409244,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDkyNDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7409244?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/etr2460","html_url":"https://github.com/etr2460","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etr2460/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etr2460/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etr2460/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etr2460/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etr2460/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etr2460/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etr2460/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etr2460/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etr2460/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-03T00:48:51Z","updated_at":"2020-03-03T00:48:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"ooh, that's good to know. i think this looks fine from my perspective then.

However I was not aware of details this deep. Thanks for that.\r\n\r\nSo, my use case was to print dashboards, and yes I explored a lots of ideas, first one was to get screenshot of dashboard using things like html2canvas and js2pdf but that did not worked out because not all the tabs were here in the DOM and I wish to capture all of them at once.\r\n\r\nAlso, with html2canvas and js2pdf quality of PDF's are not that great because of color models and svg charts :-/\r\n\r\nSo, to enusre quality and make sure all the tabs could be rendered in single pdf I went with headless browser tool. You are correct on this too. Yes of-course it's really really slow but if it works and there is no other way at the moment, I guess we have to stick with it.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's been a long time, now that I have figured things already and proceeded I guess this issue is resolved for my use case, and whatever I learnt on my own, Now I have a validation of that learning in form of this discussion as well :-) ! \r\n\r\nHowever, I am not sure we want to close this issue or not, because in my opinion even if this is not about my use case of printing dashboards, but it totally makes sense that this approach can be rethought of and there maybe scope of optimization still left over here.\r\n\r\nSo I will leave that thought on maintainers.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/593803452/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/593872463","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/8466#issuecomment-593872463","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/8466","id":593872463,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5Mzg3MjQ2Mw==","user":{"login":"jefo2k","id":10491892,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDkxODky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10491892?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jefo2k","html_url":"https://github.com/jefo2k","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jefo2k/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jefo2k/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jefo2k/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jefo2k/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jefo2k/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jefo2k/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jefo2k/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jefo2k/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jefo2k/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-03T10:15:58Z","updated_at":"2020-03-03T10:15:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @umesh11111 \r\nDid you solve this issue?!?\r\nIf yes, could you please give me some directions?!?\r\nThank you!\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/593872463/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/593990492","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/9210#issuecomment-593990492","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/9210","id":593990492,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5Mzk5MDQ5Mg==","user":{"login":"oashton","id":6887197,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODcxOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6887197?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oashton","html_url":"https://github.com/oashton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oashton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oashton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oashton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oashton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oashton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oashton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oashton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oashton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oashton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-03T14:52:16Z","updated_at":"2020-03-03T14:52:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Can you explain what `resizeEvent` does that cannot be done with `isFullSize` alone?\r\n\r\nThe `Chart.jsx shouldComponentUpdate` method has some logic to determine if the chart should update.
