Since the default for the JRE is not SHA1PRNG, any communication about the vulnerability will state it's not the default implementation. Kafka users who have not changed Kafka's default may not realize that they are vulnerable because they didn't not change a default themselves. This will put the onus on us to make a change, push a bugfix, and update users.\n\nIn addition, it may not be as simple as a bugfix. If we can't use SHA1PRNG, and there is no other globally available implementation, our choices are to either add a lot of logic to select several different implementations (which is a lot of complexity and testing/performance issues), or to revert to the default behavior (which will be a severe performance regression).

My concern is that people will miss the relevant paragraph in the documentation (the security docs are quite long) and leave a lot of performance on the table.\n\nHaving said that, I share your concern that an automatic fallback may lead to unexpected performance regressions if SHA1PRNG is unavailable. Given that, maybe we can leave things as they are, watch out for user feedback and re-evaluate then.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/241116499/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/241117373","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1762#issuecomment-241117373","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1762","id":241117373,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MTExNzM3Mw==","user":{"login":"hachikuji","id":12502538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAyNTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12502538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji","html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-19T19:48:32Z","updated_at":"2016-08-19T19:48:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@vahidhashemian Thanks for the review.

Though the code change is small the impact to the Authorizer and what users may expect is pretty large. \n\nAfter reading the Jira in a bit more detail it looks like there is a discrepancy between removing a permission/ACL and removing access. When you grant access on a specific host with one ACL and then try to delete that access with a different (more broad) ACL, nothing changes. This may appear like the incorrect behavior but I don't think it is. Instead of changing the code to delete all matching ACLs, I think the script could likely be improved to let the user know that no ACL was deleted because the requested ACL to be deleted does not exist. Alternatively providing a mechanism to list the ACLs that match is another option but would require changes to the Authorizer interface. \n\nI think there are many more cases where deleting matching ACLs could cause unwanted and surprising behavior than there are ones that would cause preferable behavior. \n\nAs a quick example, suppose you add an ACL so userA can read topic1 then by accident you add an ACL so that userA can read all(*) topics. How do you delete the second grant without deleting the first intended one?\n\nI think this change means there is no way to delete an ACL the grants the all operation on all hosts to all principles without also deleting all defined allow ACLs.

It looks like producer-props overrides producer-config, did we validate that this is the case? perhaps we want to make sure the built-in help includes this clarification.\n\nYes, producer-props will take precedence, this is in accordance with other CLI tools.

I tested on a few versions of Gradle 2.x to make sure it was backwards compatible too. \n\nRemoving `useAnt = false` wont change any behavior since it was change to false by default since 2.12. [(release notes)](https://docs.gradle.org/2.12/release-notes?_ga=1.172904483.1612453537.1415050143#ant-based-scala-compiler-deprecation). Builds before 2.12 still work but result in ant output.\n\nAs a side note, what are your thoughts on removing the checked in gradlew and gradle.bat? I know it has come up in the past but still hangs around. Downloading the wrapper replaces these anyway and they cant be used until the wrapper is downloaded. It seams they are confusing to have checked in, result in arbitrary changes, and at worst could cause some gradle compatibility problem at some point. \n\n> It turns out that one cannot even run gradle to download the project Gradle version if useAnt is used in the build.\n\nYeah this is an unfortunate gradle behavior that has bit me before. Incompatible or broken scripts prevent the wrapper task from downloading a compatible version. I am not sure the best way to fix it, or if its worth fixing.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/241757166/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/241761781","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1774#issuecomment-241761781","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1774","id":241761781,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MTc2MTc4MQ==","user":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-23T15:04:24Z","updated_at":"2016-08-23T15:04:24Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for the review @granthenke.\n\nTo be honest, I am not sure why we have checked in `gradlew`.
