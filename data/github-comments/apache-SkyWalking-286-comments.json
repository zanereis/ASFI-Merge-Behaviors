find a bug about `abort{}`.\r\nIf there are 2 lal files : default.yaml and mysql-slowsql.yaml, and they are configured by\r\n```\r\nlalFiles: ${SW_LOG_LAL_FILES:mysql-slowsql,default}\r\n```\r\nThe default.yaml will load before mysql-slowsql.yaml.\r\nSo if I send a json(layer = \"MYSQL\") to OAP, it will execute the rule in default.yaml first.
