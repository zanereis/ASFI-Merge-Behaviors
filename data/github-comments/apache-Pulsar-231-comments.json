turns out that the fix was to change the last line from:\r\n\r\n`RUN go get -u github.com/apache/pulsar/pulsar-client-go/pulsar`\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n`RUN go get -u github.com/apache/pulsar-client-go/pulsar`\r\n\r\nwhich is a very subtle difference. \r\nI'm updating this issue to request improved documentation to prevent confusion.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/654477177/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/654539828","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/6757#issuecomment-654539828","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/6757","id":654539828,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1NDUzOTgyOA==","user":{"login":"Jennifer88huang-zz","id":47805623,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODA1NjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47805623?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz","html_url":"https://github.com/Jennifer88huang-zz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-07T01:07:33Z","updated_at":"2020-07-07T01:07:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"/pulsarbot

I think we couldn't add the config `pulsar.read-compact`, this config is a global config. It is up to users to query the raw data or the compacted data, so we could add metadata for users to add in the SQL statement.\r\nSuch as `select price from pulsar.'public/default'.'stock-topic' where __compacted_topic__ = true` is used to query compacted data. Refer to the `PulsarInternalColumn.java`.\r\n\r\n2. The compacted data should be read from two parts, one is the compacted ledger and the other are normal ledgers, like the compacted Topic reading. So we should check the topic compacted position first, and generate splits through the compacted ledger and normal ledgers. One split should have one property such as `readCompacted` indicate this split is used to read compacted ledger or normal topic ledgers. We could use the normal topic name to get its compacted ledger name.\r\n\r\n@jiazhai @codelipenghui Please confirm.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/654883130/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/654896700","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/7461#issuecomment-654896700","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/7461","id":654896700,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1NDg5NjcwMA==","user":{"login":"codelipenghui","id":12592133,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTkyMTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12592133?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui","html_url":"https://github.com/codelipenghui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-07T14:19:53Z","updated_at":"2020-07-07T14:19:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The compacted data is stored in a separate ledger, I think the cursor can't read data from that ledger.

So the ledger needs two bookies by default but gets only one, which leads to the \"Not enough non-faulty bookies available\" error.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this problem you can either change the values of `managedLedgerDefaultEnsembleSize`, `managedLedgerDefaultWriteQuorum` and `managedLedgerDefaultAckQuorum` to 1 (with `broker.getConfig().set...`, using the config file does not work) or set the number of bookies to 2 (with `PulsarStandaloneBuilder.instance().withNumOfBk` or `broker.setNumOfBk`). Either way works for me.\r\n\r\n@sijie Should the default `numOfBk` in `PulsarStandalone` be changed to 2 according to default `managedLedgerDefaultEnsembleSize` to avoid this problem? I think, it doesn't make sense to have less bookies than required for a ledger.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/656214989/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/656222803","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/7488#issuecomment-656222803","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/7488","id":656222803,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1NjIyMjgwMw==","user":{"login":"97arushisharma","id":23057357,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU3MzU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23057357?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/97arushisharma","html_url":"https://github.com/97arushisharma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/97arushisharma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/97arushisharma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/97arushisharma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/97arushisharma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/97arushisharma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/97arushisharma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/97arushisharma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/97arushisharma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/97arushisharma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-09T16:20:07Z","updated_at":"2020-07-09T16:20:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I was able to resolve this problem by changing the `zkLedgersRootPath=/ledgers`.
