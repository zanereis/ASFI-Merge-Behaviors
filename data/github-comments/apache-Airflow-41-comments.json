In addition, all example dags are now unit tested and it looks like this one takes a very long time to run and not all tasks are succeeding. I'm sure that's the hive/hdfs bits. It's a very useful practical example though, so I think we should remove it from the unit tests -- please add it to the `skip_tests` list here:

long as your users don't hit the button at the exact same time, then I think you'll get the behavior you want.

guys ! @mistercrunch @criccomini \n\nI've just rebased and fixed conflicts, but it looks like Travis CI is having some random problems communicating with coveralls.\n\nI've investigated nightlies a bit more and I see two solutions for this PR to move forward :\n1. We use nightlies to trigger Travis builds on master every night. It is not super straightforward to actually figure out whether that build is a nightlies build or not (there's no env variable, see https://github.com/coderanger/nightlies/issues/12#issuecomment-208080613). The build scripts _could_ connect to the Travis API through the [Travis Client](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis.rb) to get some more information about the current build (itself). We could then check whether the commit message has been overwritten by nightlies or not, and launch the dag tests accordingly.\n2. Travis actually already automatically sets a `TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST` env variable if the build is triggered from a PR, and a `TRAVIS_BRANCH` env variable to identify what branch it is building. We could decide that we launch these dag tests only on commits to the master branch.\n\nI prefer the second option which is simpler and does not add a dependency on an extra external service. **Would you guys agree to only launch these dag tests for commits to the master branch ?** If so, I'll work on adding that condition in the build scripts.\n\nI'd really like to merge this PR asap, it's starting to take significant time to rebase and fix conflicts.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/208235787/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/208247208","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1328#issuecomment-208247208","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1328","id":208247208,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwODI0NzIwOA==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-11T09:22:14Z","updated_at":"2016-04-11T09:22:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[![Coverage

@r39132 (feel free to edit comment)\n\nSummarizing our conversation and open questions:\n1. (agreed) it is useful to have a way to delete DAGs from the DB\n2. However, they will be reimported almost immediately, so this actually isn't as much of a \"delete\" as a \"clear\".\n--> action: rename CLI command\n3. One solution is as follows : when we delete a record from the DAG table, we also add a tombstone for the DAG in a dag_tombstone table. Any process that reloads the DAG checks the tombstone table and moves it to the local deleted_dags folder. Tombstones are expired after a configurable period of time (e.g. 1 day/week/month) so that the tombstone table does not keep growing unchecked. If a user wants to undelete a dag, we will remove the tombstone entry and move the file back to the dags folder from the delete_dags folder. This will serve use-cases where users wanted to do a refresh.\n3. a. Store the hash of the dagfile in the tombstone table. That way users could update the dagfile and not have it be considered the same deleted dag.\n4.
