the GIFs are not obvious enough :)\n\nThe PR is mainly trying to improve the rendering of the streaming capability introduced in https://github.com/apache/incubator-zeppelin/pull/611.\n\nSo I will try to explain more in detail what is happening and how things work on the front-end side.\n\n### How It Works\n\nFirst of all, its good to know that this is only a case for TEXT type of return values.\n\nThe way the back-end communicates data to the front-end end is through 2 different websocket events:\n- PARAGRAPH_UPDATE_OUTPUT: Which remove previous result and replace it by the event content\n- PARAGRAPH_APPEND_OUTPUT: Which add to the end of previous result\n\nSo for example, if we take this code:\n\n```\n(1 to 40).foreach{ i=>\n    Thread.sleep(1000)\n    println(i) \n}\n```\n\nIt would send numbers from 1 to 40 with 1000ms interval, and this is what would happen:\n\n```\n- PARAGRAPH_UPDATE_OUTPUT (sent: \"\")\n\n  -- PARAGRAPH_APPEND_OUTPUT (sent: \"1\")\n\n  -- PARAGRAPH_APPEND_OUTPUT (sent: \"2\")\n\n  -- PARAGRAPH_APPEND_OUTPUT (sent: \"3\")\n\n  ...\n\n- PARAGRAPH_UPDATE_OUTPUT (sent: \"1/n2/n3/n......40\")\n```\n\nSo the way it works is that the job results are never persisted inside the Notebook before the end of the job.\n\n### The Current Problem\n\nSince the temporary results are not persisted, whenever you navigate in and out of the Running Notebook, it will first reload the previous saved result in that paragraph.\n\nSo if you did run a loop through the ABC before, The paragraph will render that result.\n\nThen you will receive some PARAGRAPH_APPEND_OUTPUT events from your running job, which will transform the result you see in your paragraph into something like:\n\n```\nA\nB\n...\nZ\n21 (PARAGRAPH_APPEND_OUTPUT)\n22 (PARAGRAPH_APPEND_OUTPUT)\n23 (PARAGRAPH_APPEND_OUTPUT)\n```\n\nMainly because the flush of previous result (visually) was done in the PARAGRAPH_UPDATE_OUTPUT event at the beginning of the job.\n\n### What the PR achieve\n\nIn this PR, we try to clear the previous unrelated result of the paragraph when the paragraph receives an PARAGRAPH_APPEND_OUTPUT event for the first time in the Notebook, in order to keep result of that job only.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/206663670/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/206680628","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/605#issuecomment-206680628","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/605","id":206680628,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNjY4MDYyOA==","user":{"login":"darionyaphet","id":4414314,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTQzMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4414314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/darionyaphet","html_url":"https://github.com/darionyaphet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darionyaphet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darionyaphet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darionyaphet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darionyaphet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darionyaphet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darionyaphet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darionyaphet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darionyaphet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darionyaphet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-07T03:27:29Z","updated_at":"2016-04-07T03:27:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi

@Leemoonsoo \n\nThank for raising question about the 3 types of variables. \n\nMy though is that Angular Variables should be merged/replaced by ResourcePool. Indeed the Angular Object scope is not very intuitive. It is first scoped by **interpreter group** then by note/paragraph.\n\nRemoving Angular Object to use Resource Pool is a good idea but there is still one pending issue: angular value watcher. As you know people can assign a watcher function in the back-end on Angular value. If we want to replace Angular objects by Resource Pool, we need to provide similar feature, unless you think we can completely drop this watcher feature ...\n\nAnother point to take into account is the **migration path**. For all people that have saved their notes as JSON with saved Angular objects, we need to handle the migration to Resource pool when the re-import those notes.\n\nAbout the Dynamic Form system I don't think we should merge it with Angular Object/Resource Pool.  Dynamic Form values are just an alias to automatically generate a form input. And the fact that its value change triggers the execution of the current paragraph can be implemented using `z.runParagraph()` Angular function that is now available.\n\nAll in all I think we should ultimately have enhanced Resource Pool and Dynamic Form only.\n\nBut those changes are very big and deserve another JIRA epic.

I believe with above suggested changes it seems that you want this PR to replace default table implementation with data-tables only...\n\nSo current PR will be without search and download/export buttons. \nMy main motive for this PR was to provide download button to download data in csv or tsv format. :P\n\nAlso you wanted to remove floatHead dependency which got added by #565  with default datatable scrollbar. \nNote: floatHead is to make table headers fixed, datatable alternative to this is FixedHeader\nFor scrolling current implementation is using perfect-scrollbar . \nPlease correct me if my understanding is wrong :P\n\nAfter going to datatables site it seems that default scrollbar of datatable needs fix \"y\" size , after doing a round of testing it seems, when we change paragraph size table will not get updated/redrawn automatically, so we will need some kind of tweak around to get that fixed or basically redraw table.\n\n[Datatable default Scroll](https://datatables.net/examples/basic_init/scroll_xy.html)\n\nI also saw a scroller and fixedheader plugin of datatable which implements scrolling over default scrollbar, but it seems that perfectScrollbar with floatHead is good alternative over those as I feel their UI is better and provide mu more functionality over these plugins...\n\n[floathead](http://mkoryak.github.io/floatThead/datatables/)\n[perfect-scrollbar](https://github.com/noraesae/perfect-scrollbar)\n\nFor other points..\n- the search bar is unnecessary in non-table case\n  I will remove search box for now, but I was thinking to dynamically update charts on filtered dataset with that searchbox (may be another PR).\n- It doesn't download the pivoted data (doesn't really matter)\n- Hard to resize\n  Please share me steps /screenshots for above.\n\nPlease feel free to add any kind of changes to my PR, I would welcome good changes, as I like to have features added to zeppelin ASAP instead of thinking for credit/contribution sharing.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/208277805/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/208334864","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/761#issuecomment-208334864","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/761","id":208334864,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwODMzNDg2NA==","user":{"login":"corneadoug","id":710411,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDQxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/710411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug","html_url":"https://github.com/corneadoug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-11T13:15:46Z","updated_at":"2016-04-11T13:15:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ankurmitujjain
