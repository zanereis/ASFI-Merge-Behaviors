One challenge with properties files is that if it is meant to be user editable then it can become cluster unfriendly.  So perhaps those things could be expressed as processor properties instead or even as a single processor property.  Not sure and perhaps you've already thought through that.  Just wanted to mention it.\r\n\r\nAnyway - great stuff and thanks for contributing!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/266179904/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/266181538","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1312#issuecomment-266181538","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1312","id":266181538,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NjE4MTUzOA==","user":{"login":"kedarchitale","id":3591086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1OTEwODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3591086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kedarchitale","html_url":"https://github.com/kedarchitale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kedarchitale/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kedarchitale/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kedarchitale/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kedarchitale/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kedarchitale/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kedarchitale/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kedarchitale/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kedarchitale/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kedarchitale/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-10T05:51:32Z","updated_at":"2016-12-10T05:51:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@joewitt, Thanks for the appreciation and early feedback. Will look into adding documentation to 'additionalDetails'. The properties file contains mappings for CCDA, which would not change once all sections are mapped, however wanted to externalize these from java code, so kept it in the bundle as resources. These properties would not be changed by NiFi user (at least don't foresee a need) and ideally should be changed and tested by contributors mapping any additional sections of CCDA. Considering this, options of having it as a single processor property or externalizing it from the bundle were not suitable. Will post on the dev list seeking feedback from the community.

Thank you.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE** - I see now that the AvroRecordConverter is instead used in ConvertAvroSchema.java, but the question remains as to how do we specify the dynamic properties via NiFi?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/266970895/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/267036674","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1312#issuecomment-267036674","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1312","id":267036674,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NzAzNjY3NA==","user":{"login":"kedarchitale","id":3591086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1OTEwODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3591086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kedarchitale","html_url":"https://github.com/kedarchitale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kedarchitale/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kedarchitale/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kedarchitale/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kedarchitale/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kedarchitale/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kedarchitale/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kedarchitale/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kedarchitale/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kedarchitale/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-14T13:43:16Z","updated_at":"2016-12-14T13:43:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"What is the next step on this?

Then node2 is **restarted**.\r\n- Case2: Node2 starts running as a standalone mode since it is disconnected from the cluster. It's able to modify the flow from node2 UI. Update the RPG setting such as Transport Protocol. Then node2 is **reconnected** by the cluster.\r\n\r\nWith above case 1 and 2, the results will be different with this fix.\r\n\r\n- Case1:\r\n  - Before fix: Node2 can join the cluster because flow of Node2 and the one in the cluster are determined as equal by fingerprint. Node2 will update its flow with the one in the cluster. This is problematic when a cluster is entirely restarted. An old flow can be elected and possibly overwrites the latest flow. \r\n  - After fix: Node2 CANNOT join the cluster since it has different flow than the cluster. This ensures each node has the latest flow.\r\n\r\n- Case2:\r\n  - Before fix: Node2 can join the cluster. It keeps working with the old flow! E.g. the latest flow uses HTTP as transport protocol on Node 1 and 3 while Node2 uses RAW protocol.\r\n  - After fix: Node2 CANNOT join the cluster. This ensures each node has the latest flow when it gets reconnected.\r\n\r\nFor both cases, expected recover operation would be: DataFlowManager removes the flow.xml.gz on Node2 then restart it to join the cluster.\r\n\r\nTested above scenarios before and after applying this fix. Confirmed it works as written above.\r\n\r\n## 2nd commit: Removed unused private methods from FingerprintFactory\r\n\r\nFingerprintFactory has two types of fingerprinting method, from XML\r\nelements and from DTO. However, the ones from DTO are not used by\r\nanywhere. IDE didn't report those private methods unused because\r\naddProcessGroupFingerprint and addSnippetFingerprint call each other,\r\nbut those are not used from outside actually.\r\n\r\nThis commit removes those private methods to keep the class clean to\r\navoid unnecessary code maintenance and tests.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/267294065/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/267402057","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1317#issuecomment-267402057","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1317","id":267402057,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NzQwMjA1Nw==","user":{"login":"bbende","id":605416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTQxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende","html_url":"https://github.com/bbende","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-15T18:22:52Z","updated_at":"2016-12-15T18:22:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks good, will merge","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/267402057/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/267451086","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1311#issuecomment-267451086","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1311","id":267451086,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NzQ1MTA4Ng==","user":{"login":"pvillard31","id":11541012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTQxMDEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11541012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31","html_url":"https://github.com/pvillard31","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-15T21:35:44Z","updated_at":"2016-12-15T21:35:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Wesley-Lawrence You're right, the appveyor failure is not related.
