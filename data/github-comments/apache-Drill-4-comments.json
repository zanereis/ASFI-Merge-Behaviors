Another case is implicit cast. Currently, there are some small differences between Calcite and Drill execution. That means, if we skip the execution for limit 0, then types which are resolved in Calcite could be different from the type if the query goes through Drill execution. For BI tool like Tableau, that means the type returned from \"limit 0\" query and type from a second query w/o \"limit 0\" could be different. \n\nIf we want to avoid the above issues, we have to detect all those cases, which are painful.

Did not seem like it from my experiments.)\n\nI tested against a query like `SELECT * FROM (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT a), COUNT(DISTINCT b), COUNT(DISTINCT c) FROM very_large_table) T LIMIT 0` and this completed two orders of magnitude faster.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/152053724/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/152056732","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/193#issuecomment-152056732","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/193","id":152056732,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MjA1NjczMg==","user":{"login":"jacques-n","id":183350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzM1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/183350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n","html_url":"https://github.com/jacques-n","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-29T02:49:38Z","updated_at":"2015-10-29T02:49:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm sorry to say that I'm -1 on this change\n\nIt seems to be adding a planning rewrite rule where there should be a simple fix execution bug.

(There are probably six or so separations between interface and implementation.) Yes, there are a lot of files that were moved. The patch creates five new modules and has to move the appropriate files into those directories. All changes were focused on the same purpose of modularization. I also chose to limit any refactoring required in these patches exactly to avoid this challenge. (Note the orange lines that I deferred in the attached PPT). As such, I think it is unfair to characterize a modularization patch by counting the number of files that were involved. \n\nOn (2): We typically order things in the order that they are ready to be merged. If this is a reasonable patch and is ready to be merged, it should be merged. If another patch has been reviewed, passes functional (and performance regression as appropriate) and is ready to be merged, it should be. In general, patches that are ready are ahead of patches that aren't ready.\n\nSpecifically on the allocator patch, on numerous occasions we have held up commits to master (and releases) to try get the allocator patch merged. On each occasion, we've found that it isn't ready to be merged due to concurrency design challenges. Let's address those before worrying about staging of the patch. Once we get the algorithm right and everyone has signed off on that, we can figure out rebasing on master and staging in relationship to other patches. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/155617242/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/155632914","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/250#issuecomment-155632914","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/250","id":155632914,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NTYzMjkxNA==","user":{"login":"parthchandra","id":6529136,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MjkxMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6529136?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra","html_url":"https://github.com/parthchandra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-11T02:16:40Z","updated_at":"2015-11-11T02:16:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"In general the patch looks fine.

We have never held up releases for the allocator work. Not once, never mind numerous occasions. For two releases during which it was not ready, I constructed special extract patches that included bug fixes only, because we believed it\nwould help the project. I did ask for people to hold off commits exactly once, for 24 hours. And once I found a problem (the rebase didn't go well), I took the hold off after about 18 hours.\n\nAs for merging patches in the order they are ready: the original allocator patch was ready about 3 months ago now. All the tests passed. The problem was that you refused to review it because it was too large. It was 213 files, less than half the size of this patch. Much like this one, there were \"virtually no functional changes in this patch and its purpose is extremely narrow in scope.\" A large number of files had minor fixes that removed warnings, because these were helpful in finding bugs (biggest example: making a number of things AutoCloseables because then the compiler tells you when you leak resources -- this found a number of problems). The core changes are in about a dozen files, mainly the rewrite of the allocator itself.\n\nYou asked, and I pointed you at those core changes. I heard nothing back for a while, until you eventually asked that I break it up into smaller patches -- but still no comments on the allocator itself. Because of the layers of changes and dependencies, that was painful, but I did break things up. The first four were ready for review in mid-August. We exchanged messages and I told you where they were; When I came back from vacation in September, they had still not been reviewed. I made a stink at MapR, and some people finally reviewed them. I continued making patches (several more) which I continued to have a hard time getting people to review. When you finally did look at one, you immediately rejected it just because it didn't have its own JIRA. I submitted a JIRA for it within an hour of that, and it, like the others, continued to be ignored. I finally badgered more folks at MapR to review them.\n\nExactly once (not \"numerous\" times), at the time we ran the performance regression (a magical thing that only folks at MapR can do), we found that there is a performance penalty. I wouldn't call it a \"concurrency design challenge.\" Yes, when you synchronize variables to get transacted behavior (memory allocation is really a balance transfer), instead of just depending on volatile variables that can change under your feet if you refer to them more than once, things are going to be slower. But you can do more.\n\nIn order to avoid this continual rebasing to track the project, I went back and made it possible for the new and old allocators to co-exist, so that the code would at least be committed while the performance penalty could be addressed (in order to avoid more rebasing in the future). This would also allow the use of the new allocator when assertions are enabled (or another debug flag), so that we could find any new problems; many of my rebases took time because I kept finding new problems introduced by ongoing work because the new allocator is much stricter than the old one.\n\nYou insisted that if others could just look at it, you were sure that a faster solution would be found; you asked for pointers to the code. I gave them to you. I never heard anything back. In any case, it is set up to only be used in debug mode for the moment, and can stay that way until someone can find a way to make it faster (and I explained the multiple implementations I tried before I finally got it down to the ~10% performance penalty it currently carries)\n\nI continued breaking things down in an attempt to get them in. We are finally down to the last two patches.\n\nNow I see a larger patch with the same characteristics, and it feels like it is being bulldozed through, even though there aren't clear benefits to having it. Your diagrams doesn't justify it, nor explain why it will be better. The new allocator, even if only used in debug mode for now, will help engineers avoid creating new leaks that the old allocator doesn't detect. Given some other suggestions I've seen to change the vector class interfaces, it seems like they're not stable enough to be broken out into a separate project yet; that will complicate changes.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/155948627/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/155954144","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/250#issuecomment-155954144","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/250","id":155954144,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NTk1NDE0NA==","user":{"login":"jacques-n","id":183350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzM1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/183350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n","html_url":"https://github.com/jacques-n","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-12T00:11:54Z","updated_at":"2015-11-12T00:11:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hey Chris, let's move this discussion to the pull request and/or patches that you're talking about.
