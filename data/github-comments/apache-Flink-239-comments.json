file creation\r\n```\r\nBut if `overwrite = false`, it will also check for existence first. Also, contrary to my initial analysis, the retries when retrieving the file status during the existence check do not cover non-existence. I can adapt the tests to only use `overwrite = true`, but actual code outside the tests makes use of both variants.\r\n\r\nIt's therefore a good idea to make the distinction between `flink-s3-fs-hadoop` and `flink-s3-fs-presto` but only for the existence check, not for checking that a file/directory was deleted since\r\n> Amazon S3 offers eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES in all regions.\r\n\r\nI adapted the code accordingly which effectively boiled down to removing some of the new eventual consistent existence checks in `PrestoS3FileSystemITCase`.\r\n\r\nRegarding the two implementations you provided: for doing the existence check, there should not be a difference between a single `fs.exists()` call vs. `fs.open()` in terms of consistency.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/377216825/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/377217539","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/5756#issuecomment-377217539","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/5756","id":377217539,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NzIxNzUzOQ==","user":{"login":"pnowojski","id":8957547,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NTc1NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8957547?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski","html_url":"https://github.com/pnowojski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-29T12:20:10Z","updated_at":"2018-03-29T12:20:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/377217539/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/377219970","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/5394#issuecomment-377219970","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/5394","id":377219970,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NzIxOTk3MA==","user":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-29T12:30:20Z","updated_at":"2018-03-29T12:30:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"What's the state @zentol?
