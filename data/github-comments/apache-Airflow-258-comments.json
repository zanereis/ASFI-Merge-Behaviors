I looked at views.py again, most views inherit from `AirflowModelView` which is a subclass of `flask_appbuilder.ModelView`. Are those the views you think this action_logging decorator will miss? So I looked at some logs, I can confirm that actions such as `Airflow.graph`, `Airflow.clear`, `Airflow.delete` etc are all logged. So I believe the views using ModelView are not missed. Maybe I have misinterpreted what you meant? If that's the case pls point out.\r\n\r\nAlso, what's the path from here?

It will not work in the sense that you will additionally need to specify either the `region_name` in the extra parameters (which the [docs](https://airflow.apache.org/howto/connection/aws.html#configuring-the-connection) mention) or set the `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` environment variable.\r\n\r\nI would argue that the `aws_default` connection with \"bare\" install does not work for anyone who operates outside of the `us-east-1`. I realize it is special for historical reasons but with [22 regions](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/), I would wager that many will be hit by the unexpected behavior I described in the PR description: that you won't realize Airflow is silently using `us-east-1` as the default region without digging through the code.\r\n\r\nI firmly believe that explicit is better than implicit, especially in cases of default configuration. Hence, I see it more as fixing a small bug than changing some already-established behavior.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/535940021/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/535941702","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5743#issuecomment-535941702","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5743","id":535941702,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNTk0MTcwMg==","user":{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-27T13:34:52Z","updated_at":"2019-09-27T13:34:52Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Something we don't currently encode/support but that we will need to for the webserver to work is the \"Operator Links\" - https://airflow.apache.org/howto/define_extra_link.html\r\n\r\nI suspect to make this work and make the code for the link class work/be available in the webserver we'll have to move towards making all those link classes come from plugins (rather than just the global ones)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/535941702/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/535946595","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5129#issuecomment-535946595","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5129","id":535946595,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNTk0NjU5NQ==","user":{"login":"eugene-chernyshenko","id":53478755,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNDc4NzU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53478755?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugene-chernyshenko","html_url":"https://github.com/eugene-chernyshenko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugene-chernyshenko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugene-chernyshenko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugene-chernyshenko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugene-chernyshenko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugene-chernyshenko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugene-chernyshenko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugene-chernyshenko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugene-chernyshenko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugene-chernyshenko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-27T13:47:07Z","updated_at":"2019-09-27T13:47:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Why dont you want to allow user to configure a path of the webserver_config.py?\r\nWhy do you hardcode it?\r\nThere is no way to mount this file from configmap to AIFRLOW_HOME  in k8s cluster.
