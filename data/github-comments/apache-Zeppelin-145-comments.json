One question about the cluster mode for spark interpreter. It looks like you are creating a general yarn app support for all the interpreters. But for spark, it has already supported yarn-cluster, we could deploy spark interpreter as yarn-cluster mode via spark-submit. Although your approach may work, but I am afraid it may lose some features compared to the native yarn support of spark and add extra overhead of maintenance of feature parity between native yarn-cluster of spark and zeppelin yarn-cluster.

I know spark already have yarn-cluster by itself. In case of Zeppelin, SparkInterpreter will run yarn-client mode which means driver is still in a process zeppelin launches. at the same time, SparkInterpreter will run in a yarn cluster as one of application masters and will launch Spark's application master as a new application master in yarn cluster. It's fully same as spark-summit does except one thing to spark driver is also in yarn cluster.

you mean there would be 2 yarn apps for launching one spark interpreter ? That looks a little weird to me. In this approach, we still launch remote interpreter process in the zeppelin host, that doesn't solve much memory issue of zeppelin host. And besides it would waste yarn resources as it require to launch 2 yarn apps. Why not leverage spark-submit to support yarn-cluster mode ? And I look at all the interpreters of zeppelin. Most of them are just client role. That means the computation happens in the backend not in the interpreter side. so I think it would be fine to launch these interpreters in shared/scoped mode for all users.

Apparently the ticket is not held when using LdapRealm while with LdapGroupRealm it is fine. So you \r\n do not need to access api/notebooks but just refreshing the page shows the same behaviour. This happens because when using the LdapRealm no session id is set. I will report further if I figure out why this is happening.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/300774220/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/300829447","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2334#issuecomment-300829447","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2334","id":300829447,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMDgyOTQ0Nw==","user":{"login":"zjffdu","id":164491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu","html_url":"https://github.com/zjffdu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-11T15:39:43Z","updated_at":"2017-05-11T15:39:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yeah, that's seem flaky test.
