First I have to mention that there are code styling issues (tabs instead of spaces, no spaces in front of parenthesis etc.) but that's less important right now ...\n\nImportant part is: Different databases have different SQL dialects and in this patch it is proposed to switch from one dialect (that was very common but less flexible) to the other dialect which is AFAIK less supported.\n\nHere's some sources of inspiration maybe:\n\n[1] http://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_primarykey.asp\n[2] http://www.techonthenet.com/sql/primary_keys.php\n\nTo make this work we should only touch the JdbcCreateTableBuilder IMO. The abstract one is not supposed/guaranteed to generate perfect SQL for all databases, just like Query.toSql() will not generate SQL that is working on all databases. It is in the concrete implementation of CreateTableBuilder that we figure that part out (and in non-JDBC modules it is not a CREATE TABLE statement but some other operation anyway).\n\nThe JdbcCreateTableBuilder should take advice or delegate to the QueryRewriter interface.

I am aware of the issue but I think this solution is a bit too fragile. It only reads the first line to determine the data type and it also does type casting/narrowing on each single value instead of trying to establish a data type and only narrow according to that type. That essentially means that as a user I have no guarantee that row 1 is going to have the same data types as row 2. That feels very unsafe to me at least. I could effectively have a table with e.g. column type NUMBER which would make sense on the first row but on the second row I would get a String or something completely different.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/94541818/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/96409034","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metamodel/pull/16#issuecomment-96409034","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/16","id":96409034,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk2NDA5MDM0","user":{"login":"ashish-m-yh","id":787428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NzQyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/787428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashish-m-yh","html_url":"https://github.com/ashish-m-yh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashish-m-yh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashish-m-yh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashish-m-yh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashish-m-yh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashish-m-yh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashish-m-yh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashish-m-yh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashish-m-yh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashish-m-yh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-26T17:00:33Z","updated_at":"2015-04-26T17:00:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I

Below are my thoughts.\n1. We actually need \"leftItem\" and \"rightItem\" as we even use it in compound from items ultimately, since it's the only way to represent join. \n2. \"on items\" are indeed array of select items and for each from item we need them seperately since there might be other operations than \"=\".\n3. I didn't try about nested from items but it needs code change more than this. Moreover with this approach we are using existing code which is both unit tested and time tested.\n4. This doesn't cause any api changes either as there is no change in signature of any public method.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/96911117/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/96911593","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metamodel/pull/20#issuecomment-96911593","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/20","id":96911593,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk2OTExNTkz","user":{"login":"narahari92","id":6235216,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzUyMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235216?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narahari92","html_url":"https://github.com/narahari92","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narahari92/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narahari92/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narahari92/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narahari92/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narahari92/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narahari92/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narahari92/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narahari92/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narahari92/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-28T05:12:41Z","updated_at":"2015-04-28T05:12:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"And any idea why travis ci build failed.

But in my opinion we are also not catering to the normal cases. MetaModel exposes an API that is useful especially because it is the _same_ API across all datastores. That means our users often use MetaModel in scenarios where they might just as well use a relational database or an Excel sheet as the backing store. The benefit they get with MetaModel is that their code to process data can run on any given datastore. That means the type of use is often pretty untypical. So having support for JOIN in Solr is actually pretty important in my opinion. I would even go as far as to say that effeciency in execution is secondary to compatibility with the API. Reason being that if people are trying to get the most performance out of their Solr system then they will anyways be going directly to Solr's primary API.\n\nThat said I do believe that there are scenarios you absolutely should support.\n\nMy suggestion is just that you start small and get something that functionally fulfills the whole API. Then expand on a case-by-case basis to add optimized support for various classes of queries. For instance you can start with just materializeMainSchemaTable - make it work without any default limits or anything like that. And make sure that it is cursor based so that you don't load a million records into memory but rather maintain a cursor in the dataset implementation.\n\nOnce that is working I would expand the scope to also have support for COUNT queries. And then maybe queries with just a single WHERE item. And so on and so on ... Makes sense?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/98796448/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/98801556","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metamodel/pull/20#issuecomment-98801556","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/20","id":98801556,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk4ODAxNTU2","user":{"login":"kaspersorensen","id":291450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTQ1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/291450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen","html_url":"https://github.com/kaspersorensen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-04T18:11:57Z","updated_at":"2015-05-04T18:11:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The right item way is also possible because anyone can build such a query programmatically.
