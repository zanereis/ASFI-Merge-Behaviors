@motus,\r\nI've made the change so that MetricTracker's field Records will be null if the metric does not keep history, which simplifies the code somewhat. I kept the KeeupUpdateHistory field in the tracker because it is needed when the driver receives new metric data to decide whether to append or swap out the records.\r\n\r\nRegarding ValueUntyped and non-generic IMetric, this is to enable all implementations of IMetric to be stored in the same collection. If IMetric took a generic parameter, then MetricTracker would also need to be templatized, and then MetricsData wouldn't be able to store all the trackers of different types in a single dict. To make up for it, EvaluatorMetrics and DriverMetrics enforces a typed implementation in CreateAndRegister. Hope this makes it clearer.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/404001772/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/404003586","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/1477#issuecomment-404003586","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/1477","id":404003586,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNDAwMzU4Ng==","user":{"login":"markusweimer","id":502371,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjM3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/502371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer","html_url":"https://github.com/markusweimer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-11T00:07:00Z","updated_at":"2018-07-11T00:07:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"There is a circular dependency in the project files. `Org.Apache.REEF.Bridge.Core` and `Org.Apache.REEF.Bridge.Core.Driver` depend on each other.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/404003586/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/404019302","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/1460#issuecomment-404019302","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/1460","id":404019302,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNDAxOTMwMg==","user":{"login":"motus","id":31380,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMzgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31380?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/motus","html_url":"https://github.com/motus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/motus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/motus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/motus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/motus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/motus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/motus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/motus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/motus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/motus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-11T01:52:22Z","updated_at":"2018-07-11T01:52:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @mandyshieh, I am still trying to understand the logic, but I have a feeling that we can be more type safe in many places.

Ideally, it'd be better if the values were stored as specific types, but that would require the user to specify that type along with the metric class on creation(`CreateAndRegisterMetric<IntegerMetric, int>() `instead of just `CreateAndRegisterMetric<IntegerMetric>()`). In the end we concluded that the lesser of two evils would be to make IMetric non-generic to eliminate the possibility of error in CreateAndRegister<T,U> when T and U don't match, especially since this PR contains concrete implementations for most cases so the user doesn't need to implement their own IMetric<U>.\r\n\r\n@singlis feel free to chime in if there are points I didn't cover well.

In addition to cleaning up unused directives, long lines, etc., there are two main changes:\r\n1. Took out the int ChangesSinceLastSink variable. Instead, the sink checks thresholds by directly counting from the cache of records.

I have address them by either revising the test or removing it due to the test no longer making sense. More specifically, REEF.NET assumed that if a task failed then the Evaluator should crash. This, however, does not happen on the Java side. In earlier conversations, I pointed out this semantic mismatch, and decided to correct it in the new bridge. As such, tests on the old bridge that assumed the incorrect semantics have been either removed or revised to match the correct semantics. \r\n\r\nAt this point, I believe tests that fail either do so in main or pass on my location machine: one instance of this is:\r\n```\r\nOrg.Apache.REEF.Tests.Functional.IMRU.TestFailMapperEvaluatorsOnInit.TestFailedMapperOnLocalRuntime [FAIL]\r\n```\r\nWhich passes on my local machine but seems to fail on AppVeyor because in can't read the log:\r\n```\r\nCannot read from log file C:\\projects\\reef\\lang\\cs\\bin\\.netcore\\Release\\Org.Apache.REEF.Tests\\net461\\REEF_LOCAL_RUNTIME7253ce0e\\reef-BroadcastReduceDriver-20180907140304298\\driver\\driver.stdout\r\n```\r\n\r\nMoving forward, it is my understanding that all of these tests will go away when the new bridge is in place, which is why I ported @motus  tests over to the new bridge.

So Tyson feel free to correct. Here is what I see that is happening. The JAR project (Org.Apache.REEF.JAR) that builds the java side of REEF is not listed as a dependency for Bridge.Core. Therefore we do not build jar files for the project. The JAR project not only builds the Java side, but also copies the jar files to be bundled into a REEF assembly. \r\n\r\nWith these changes, you are bundling the jar file in Org.Apache.Bridge.Core.Grpc.csproj file. I believe this is failing silently if jar files do not exist as we grabbing with a glob of *.jar.\r\n\r\nAs a result Sergiy tried to build out the JAR project manually on Linux and thats when he hit the issues with mvn.cmd and protoc.exe. As quick fix to see if this would work, he renamed the commands to be linux specific and this uncovered the next issue, which is that msbuild tries to build the JAR project -- not dotnet. I believe the JAR csproj needs to be converted to work as a Rosyln task in order to get this working in order to build with dotnet.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/427221852/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/427496722","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/1477#issuecomment-427496722","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/1477","id":427496722,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNzQ5NjcyMg==","user":{"login":"tcondie","id":1696558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTY1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1696558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcondie","html_url":"https://github.com/tcondie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcondie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcondie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcondie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcondie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcondie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcondie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcondie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcondie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcondie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-05T20:57:10Z","updated_at":"2018-10-05T20:57:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Spot on @singlis \r\n\r\nI'll switch it over to a use Rosyln tasks, hopefully without too much effort, then make it a netstandard2.0 library.

Tang enforces singleton semantics for objects to be instantiated by it. And in a List, one can refer to the same type multiple times, without giving it a name as in `NamedParameter`. Hence, I believe it is expected behavior for this to only ever work with Sets.

Few very minor comments for today. Check for naming conventions and make\n>> sure you use {0}-style string interpolation in logging instead of string\n>> concatenation or $\"\". (Note that for exceptions it's the other way\n>> around)\n>\n> Can you please explain to me the intuition behind this?\n>\n\nSure! In case of explicit string concatenation or $\"...\" - style\ninterpolation, the entire string is evaluated *before* the method\ninvocation. This is exactly what we need for exceptions and most of other\nmethods and constructors as well.\n\nFor logging, the situation is different, as we don't know if the string\nwill be used at all. If the log level is higher than the priority of the\ncurrent log message, the logging call is basically a no-op, and the string\nparameter will be ignored. That is, if we build a string *before* the\nlogging call, it can be a big waste, especially if the log message is long\nand expensive to construct. This is why for logging we want to perform\nstring interpolation *inside* the logging method, so the logger can do it\nonly when it knows for sure that we need to log that string. Sometimes we\neven wrap the logging call into Logger.IsLoggable() check, if interpolation\nat the logger level is not possible.\n\nInternal logging string interpolation uses {0}-style placeholders, hence\nthe rule: use {0} style for logging, $\"...\" for everything else.\n\nHope that helps! :)\n\nCheers,\nSergiy.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/459176549/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/463732140","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/1487#issuecomment-463732140","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/1487","id":463732140,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MzczMjE0MA==","user":{"login":"interesaaat","id":1534199,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzQxOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1534199?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/interesaaat","html_url":"https://github.com/interesaaat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/interesaaat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/interesaaat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/interesaaat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/interesaaat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/interesaaat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/interesaaat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/interesaaat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/interesaaat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/interesaaat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-14T18:13:25Z","updated_at":"2019-02-14T18:13:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Here's another round of comments.
