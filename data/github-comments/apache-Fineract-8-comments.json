The point of #606 / #617 remains valid - we should not have any direct dependencies in code to BVal (only to the javax.validation API), but we do need it at runtime.

You may get a bigger idea about this if you check that pull request. If you want a more detailed I may try to update it.\r\n\r\nThe general idea for the Rates Module is that rate amounts can be associated to a description and later be used to set the nominal interest rate used to create a loan.\r\n\r\nFor our business the nominal interest rate, is calculated by adding multiple rate previously defined, for example: let's say I have a specific rate for widowed people of 8%, a specific rate for college students of  7 % and a general rate for all of our clients of 6 % . When a widowed person comes and asks for a loan I may have choose the widowed rate and general rate to get the rate of  14%. These rates also help us restrict the interest amount that can be set when creating a new loan account beyond the min and max values.\r\n\r\nThis changes are mostly reflected in the Mifos UI because we didn't wanted to change a lot of how Fineract works actually. However the amount of files changed and added here may be overwhelming for some but all previous reviews have improved the idea we had initially about this module.  \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/514399238/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/514701996","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/614#issuecomment-514701996","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/614","id":514701996,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNDcwMTk5Ng==","user":{"login":"vorburger","id":298598,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODU5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/298598?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger","html_url":"https://github.com/vorburger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-24T16:21:35Z","updated_at":"2019-07-24T16:21:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@angelboxes sorry I forgot if you are a committer?

This PR this removes the clean, in its 2nd commit, but it builds on top of #633 which is the first commit... I raise 2 separate PRs for separate review - but it's probably just confusing... :smile: GitHub, contrary to Gerrit, doesn't support this kind of workflow very well - if you want to make 2 changes which touch the same lines of code. (If you raise two separate PRs from master, then one will nessarily conflict with the other, which is just overhead.)\r\n\r\nWhat I don't understand is why Travis CI doesn't run for these 2 PRs... or is it just overloaded?
