have another use case with Skywalking trace ID which has nothing to do with AliCloud's products. I want to format Log4j2 logs as JSON with the pattern layout. In order to make the log message a valid JSON, I need to double-quote `%traceId` in the following way:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"TID\" : \"%traceId\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAn example log message is:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"TID\" : \"TID: df16a9001ca34cafbe23cbc5751c0d66.96.16206346254060001\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut what I really want is:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"TID\" : \"df16a9001ca34cafbe23cbc5751c0d66.96.16206346254060001\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor now, I need to use the following `TraceIdConverter` wrapper to remove the prefix:\r\n```java\r\n@Plugin(name = \"TraceIdConverter\", category = \"Converter\")\r\n@ConverterKeys({\"sw_tid\"})\r\npublic class SwTraceIdConverter extends LogEventPatternConverter {\r\n\r\n  private TraceIdConverter converter;\r\n\r\n  protected SwTraceIdConverter(String name, String style) {\r\n    super(name, style);\r\n    converter = TraceIdConverter.newInstance(null);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public static SwTraceIdConverter newInstance(String[] options) {\r\n    return new SwTraceIdConverter(\"sw_tid\", \"sw_tid\");\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @Override\r\n  public void format(final LogEvent event, final StringBuilder toAppendTo) {\r\n    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\r\n    converter.format(event, sb);\r\n    String traceId = sb.toString().substring(5);\r\n    toAppendTo.append(traceId);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the `TID: ` prefix can be removed, I don't need to do any coding to have the above valid JSON. And if the user really wants something like `TID: df16a9001ca34cafbe23cbc5751c0d66.96.16206346254060001`, he can use `TID: %traceId`. Here is another issue requesting the removal of the prefix: #6142. @ecyuan\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/skywalking-java/blob/main/docs/en/setup/service-agent/java-agent/Application-toolkit-log4j-2.x.md now supports both `%traceId` and `%sw_ctx`. `%sw_ctx` has all the context information beside Skywalking trace ID. If the prefix can't be removed, `%traceId` can be more easily used in Log4j2 pattern layout. And if the user wants to more tracing context information, he can use `%sw_ctx`.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/913392697/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/913392918","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/6142#issuecomment-913392918","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/6142","id":913392918,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArmls842cUUW","user":{"login":"yaojingguo","id":516386,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNjM4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/516386?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaojingguo","html_url":"https://github.com/yaojingguo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaojingguo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaojingguo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaojingguo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaojingguo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaojingguo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaojingguo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaojingguo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaojingguo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaojingguo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-06T06:58:21Z","updated_at":"2021-09-06T06:58:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Here
