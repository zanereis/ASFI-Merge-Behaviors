This way signals (ie. SIGKILL) are not being passed to the children. Thus you need a way to track the PID of the process group of the children. `os.exec` is not the right way to do this as it is deprecated. However, normally you can solve this by passing `os.preexec_fn=os.setsid` to `subprocess.Popen` but this only works when executing as root as it breaks some assumed requirements. There are two solutions to this:\n1. Let airflow run gunicorn, store its PID in a file (ie. /var/run/airflow-webserver.pid) and exit immediately. This how most daemons are run and init.d scripts and systemd know how to handle this. However it might break some assumptions around airflow how it is currently run.\n2. Create a signal handler in airflow that manages the gunicorn process and passes the signals. This is more complex but keeps the way airflow currently works.\n\nI'm in favor of option 1 as it is more standard, I'll see if I can keep current behavior by including a flag (-f for foreground or something like that). Please let me know if option 2 seems more logical.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/170337301/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/170343095","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/852#issuecomment-170343095","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/852","id":170343095,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MDM0MzA5NQ==","user":{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-10T12:58:10Z","updated_at":"2016-01-10T12:58:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ybendana can you please test the PR? \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/170343095/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/170343320","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/852#issuecomment-170343320","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/852","id":170343320,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MDM0MzMyMA==","user":{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-10T13:03:12Z","updated_at":"2016-01-10T13:03:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mistercrunch I am slightly worried that some other subprocess might also need some work (celery workers?).

Paralellize the dag tests on existing builds:\n   - Run the unit tests on the full build matrix, for each PR\n   - Spread the dag tests on existing builds to \"parallelize\" them, for each PR\n     (e.g. backfill tests on one build, scheduler tests on another)\n   \n   => Simple but only pushes the problem a bit further as people will add more tests\n2. Trigger dag tests nightly through the travis api:\n   - Run the unit tests on the full build matrix, for each PR\n   - Run the dag tests on the full build matrix, nightly, triggered through the [travis api](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/triggering-builds)\n   \n   => Requires external service that triggers travis every night\n   => Some bugs might be caught after being merged to master (although before going into `airbnb_prod`)\n3. Trigger dag tests through a staging branch mechanism:\n   - Create a staging branch that acts as the trunk, keep master for validated changes through dag tests\n   - Run the unit tests on the full build matrix for each PR on trunk\n   - Run the dag tests on the full build matrix, for each PR on master\n   \n   => Heavily complexifies the process with extra PRs\n\nWe think the second option makes more sense, as it doesn't slow down the PRs while still protecting the `airbnb_prod` with dags tests (or integration tests).\n\nI you agree, we only need to update the travis configuration and find that extra service to trigger the nightly builds. Would you have a way of automating the travis trigger nightly from inside airbnb ?

related.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/172432637/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/172481831","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/748#issuecomment-172481831","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/748","id":172481831,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MjQ4MTgzMQ==","user":{"login":"thoralf-gutierrez","id":5640848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NDA4NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5640848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thoralf-gutierrez","html_url":"https://github.com/thoralf-gutierrez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thoralf-gutierrez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thoralf-gutierrez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thoralf-gutierrez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thoralf-gutierrez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thoralf-gutierrez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thoralf-gutierrez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thoralf-gutierrez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thoralf-gutierrez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thoralf-gutierrez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-18T09:52:51Z","updated_at":"2016-01-18T09:52:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hey

For one, you don't want to execute on a fixed schedule. You essentially want to be notified when new data arrives -- when it does, you want to execute a transformation to hive.\n\nIf you were using AWS, I'd recommend that you drop your csv files to S3. You can set S3 up to publish new object notifications via SNS/SQS. You can then write a SQS consumer to read the SQS notifications, pull the csv objects out of S3, transform it, and then insert it into Hive. \n\nThis is a continuous process.. and does not rely on a schedule. It's okay to have some ad-hoc DAGs and tasks in airflow that are not tied to a schedule, but often they will be triggered by some other job that is running on a schedule. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/174157417/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/174193859","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/904#issuecomment-174193859","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/904","id":174193859,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3NDE5Mzg1OQ==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-23T15:30:06Z","updated_at":"2016-01-23T15:30:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Good catch!
