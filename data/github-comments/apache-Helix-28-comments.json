However, as I explained in the PR description, the changes have been tested locally but since Zookeeper server makes no guarantee on exactly when the TTL nodes are deleted (see [here](https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.5.9/zookeeperProgrammers.html#TTL+Nodes)), the tests become flaky and as a result, are not added to this PR. I can add the tests, but we either need to wait a long time to be sure nodes are deleted, or we will see random test failures in the CI workflow.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/1122821548/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/1122905359","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/helix/issues/2084#issuecomment-1122905359","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2084","id":1122905359,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAPIHxc5C7i0P","user":{"login":"micahstubbs","id":2119400,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTk0MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2119400?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/micahstubbs","html_url":"https://github.com/micahstubbs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/micahstubbs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/micahstubbs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/micahstubbs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/micahstubbs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/micahstubbs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/micahstubbs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/micahstubbs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/micahstubbs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/micahstubbs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-10T21:42:33Z","updated_at":"2022-05-10T21:42:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"for reference, this is what the form should look like: \r\n\r\n<img width=\"512\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-05-10 at 2 42 06 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2119400/167726724-443e078b-b404-4e9a-9dd6-37ed9d4278ae.png\">\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/1122905359/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/1122907464","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/helix/issues/2084#issuecomment-1122907464","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2084","id":1122907464,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAPIHxc5C7jVI","user":{"login":"micahstubbs","id":2119400,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTk0MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2119400?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/micahstubbs","html_url":"https://github.com/micahstubbs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/micahstubbs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/micahstubbs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/micahstubbs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/micahstubbs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/micahstubbs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/micahstubbs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/micahstubbs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/micahstubbs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/micahstubbs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-10T21:44:26Z","updated_at":"2022-05-10T21:44:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Let's try to upgrade to 7.2 first and then try the form again.

They were all the same: `@ViewChild(child, opts)` now requires the second arg, `opts`. We pass in `{static: true}` to solve the TypeScript error and keep the old behavior.\r\n\r\n> If you use ViewChild or ContentChild, we're updating the way we resolve these queries to give developers more control. You must now specify that change detection should run before results are set. Example: @ContentChild('foo', {static: false}) foo !: ElementRef;. ng update will update your queries automatically, but it will err on the side of making your queries static for compatibility.
