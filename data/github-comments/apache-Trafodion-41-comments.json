As I override the new/delete operation to trace memory usage(actually not exactly override new/delete operation, as we have macro wrapping the new/delete operations, I managed simply add tracing code in those wrappers, as you can see them in Debug.h/.cpp), I do found about 3 leaking places, but not significant, I fixed them already in the recent commits, left only one global object(srvrGlobal), which should be living during the entire lifetime until process exit, thus we cannot free it. Also, I've gone through the codes very carefully(almost line by line), and I did not find any other leaking memories.\n\nI managed to run a group of YCSB tests with scale 10/stream 5 and scale 10/stream 10. I have some problem with uploading the log files here earlier this morning((maybe network or the zip file is not supported by github? no idea...), I will have another try later, or just put it on OneDriver or something else, and paste the URL here.\n\nAs T2 actually residents on server local, so the tests actually only run on single node as well as all streams are on the one same node, and seems rowsets requires ESPs cost plenty memories. According to the machine resource limitation, that's all I can ran for now. But still, I observed the memory growing during the tests run, but now I have no idea where the leaking spot is, as the tracing does not show anything from several rounds of tests, neither as I read the code. My suspicion is there might be some leaking in CLI, or may some references requested through CLI were not closed properly through, the modern CLI rowset APIs are quite different from the old fashion calls which T2 used to use. Anyway, I'm not quite familiar with CLI calls, so they are kind of complicated to me. And as we don't have any documents of CLI APIs(or it's just I never found, if you know there's any, please tel me), so this still needs time to investigate, and some help to understand the CLI would be better.\n\nMy opinion is we cannot have a pie with one bite, so we can merge this part first, in the meanwhile we keep investigate on the mem growing and CLI calls, and we will have another PR for this.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/229859758/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/229863536","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/561#issuecomment-229863536","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/561","id":229863536,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyOTg2MzUzNg==","user":{"login":"Traf-Jenkins","id":12548626,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQ4NjI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12548626?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/Traf-Jenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-01T06:22:15Z","updated_at":"2016-07-01T06:22:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Test

think it would be reasonable to have a JIRA describing the results and growth of memory during these tests. Studying the CLI API alone will not be enough since a whole lot of additional processing happen during execution. It could be any of the executor TCBs executing the sql statement as well. So some careful experimenting and repeated analysis needs to be done and some joint effort with executor may be needed to achieve this.  So it would be good to merge the functionality in and analyze the growth separately as part of the new JIRA. Will wait to see if  atleast one  other committer agrees. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/229867700/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/229868800","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/566#issuecomment-229868800","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/566","id":229868800,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyOTg2ODgwMA==","user":{"login":"sandhyasun","id":12959766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTU5NzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12959766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandhyasun","html_url":"https://github.com/sandhyasun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandhyasun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandhyasun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandhyasun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandhyasun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandhyasun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandhyasun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandhyasun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandhyasun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandhyasun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-01T06:53:40Z","updated_at":"2016-07-01T06:53:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The extra tests are going to fail since there is a hang issue during a TM rollback.
