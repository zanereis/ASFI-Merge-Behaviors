However, I don't think this can meet all the needs you discussed, which really needs to dynamically change the parameters passed into MessageFormat.  My thought was something along the lines of -\r\n\r\n```java\r\ninterface NbBundle.ParameterFilter {\r\n    Object[] filter(Class<?> clazz, String resName, Object[] arr);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nregistered in META-INF and called as part of `NbBundle.getMessage()`.  This should allow the sort of override you're talking about for any message - about panel is not the only problem.  A complication may be that I'm not sure NbBundle could use Lookup for this?  And need to be careful of performance concerns.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'd suggest taking this discussion into JIRA?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/362662452/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/362672248","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/393#issuecomment-362672248","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/393","id":362672248,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MjY3MjI0OA==","user":{"login":"SirIntellegence","id":3401182,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDExODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3401182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SirIntellegence","html_url":"https://github.com/SirIntellegence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SirIntellegence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SirIntellegence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SirIntellegence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SirIntellegence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SirIntellegence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SirIntellegence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SirIntellegence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SirIntellegence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SirIntellegence/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-02T18:51:35Z","updated_at":"2018-02-02T18:51:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Submitted to JIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NETBEANS-352","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/362672248/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/362904875","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/404#issuecomment-362904875","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/404","id":362904875,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MjkwNDg3NQ==","user":{"login":"jlahoda","id":124144,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDE0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/124144?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda","html_url":"https://github.com/jlahoda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-04T12:57:04Z","updated_at":"2018-02-04T12:57:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I wonder: is there a chance to move this into some existing directory (or a sub-directory of thereof)?
