This adds quite a bit more content to each snapshot in metadata, especially when collecting partition summaries. The rationale for this is:\r\n\r\n> This is needed in trino in order to reliably provide number of deleted rows to the user, also when delete happens to delete no files.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if that's a good reason to add this. If you want to rely on these summary properties, why not default to 0 if the property isn't there? Seems like the argument against that is the narrow case where the property is modified on the Iceberg side without anyone noticing, but I don't see a reason to modify these properties so the problem is very unlikely to occur.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I wouldn't expect summary properties to be used to report back. Typically, I'd recommend checking the metadata tree for things like number of deleted records. Although if you're happy with these for user reporting then it should be fine.

This made it challenging to implement the Accessors because it would first create the object that should be set to `inner`, and then the parent objects. Instead of visiting the leaves first, I've changed the code to pre-order traversal. This way we can just recursively construct the accessors.\r\n\r\nLet's consider the following schema:\r\n```\r\nSchema: table {\r\n  2: id: required int\r\n  1: data: optional string\r\n  3: location: optional struct<5: latitude: required float, 6: longitude: required float>\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore it would visit:\r\n```\r\nField: 2: id: required int\r\nField: 1: data: optional string\r\nField: 5: latitude: required float\r\nField: 6: longitude: required float\r\nStruct: struct<5: latitude: required float, 6: longitude: required float>\r\nField: 3: location: optional struct<5: latitude: required float, 6: longitude: required float>\r\nStruct: struct<2: id: required int, 1: data: optional string, 3: location: optional struct<5: latitude: required float, 6: longitude: required float>>\r\n```\r\nWe first visit all the fields, and then the objects.

@szehon-ho, @aokolnychyi:  PR is ready for review. \r\n\r\na) I tested with local file system and local test case in IDE, without cache (22ms), with cache (18ms) with 1000 manifest list files to read. \r\nNot so much difference, probably because it is local file system. As PR avoids reading manifest list files again (verified with logs), in S3 file system probably better difference can be seen with huge number of snapshots.\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Test\r\n  public void testExpireSnapshotUsingNamedArgs() {\r\n    sql(\"CREATE TABLE %s (id bigint NOT NULL, data string) USING iceberg\", tableName);\r\n\r\n    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {\r\n      sql(\"INSERT INTO TABLE %s VALUES (1, 'a')\", tableName);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    Table table = validationCatalog.loadTable(tableIdent);\r\n\r\n    Assert.assertEquals(\"Should be 1000 snapshots\", 1000, Iterables.size(table.snapshots()));\r\n\r\n    waitUntilAfter(table.currentSnapshot().timestampMillis());\r\n\r\n    Timestamp currentTimestamp =

time taken in ms: 22589  -- without cache\r\n```\r\n  \r\n**b) Also in the base code I found we use caching for `RewriteManifestsProcedure`, so I used the same pattern and syntax (keeping cache as default).**\r\nAlso found a bug in the base code and raised PR #4722 \r\n\r\nc) I have some more plans for improving the `expire_snaphots` (different idea than https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3457), I will work in the subsequent PR.\r\n\r\nIdea is that add a new column \"from_snapshot_id\" while preparing the actual files, then filter out (NOT IN filter) the expired snapshot ids rows from persisted output (without scanning again) and then same logic of df.except() to find the expired files.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1120406659/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1120420694","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/4471#issuecomment-1120420694","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4471","id":1120420694,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85CyENW","user":{"login":"peterxiong13","id":40230517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjMwNTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40230517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterxiong13","html_url":"https://github.com/peterxiong13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterxiong13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterxiong13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterxiong13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterxiong13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterxiong13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterxiong13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterxiong13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterxiong13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterxiong13/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-08T13:37:11Z","updated_at":"2022-05-08T13:37:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"我也碰到此问题了，快照过期和删除孤儿文件都卡在最后一步，10个小时都没反应","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1120420694/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1120421521","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/4471#issuecomment-1120421521","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4471","id":1120421521,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85CyEaR","user":{"login":"peterxiong13","id":40230517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjMwNTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40230517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterxiong13","html_url":"https://github.com/peterxiong13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterxiong13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterxiong13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterxiong13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterxiong13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterxiong13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterxiong13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterxiong13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterxiong13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterxiong13/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-08T13:42:42Z","updated_at":"2022-05-08T13:42:42Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"用表方式对快照过期则不会卡住，但很多文件都没有被删除掉，导致小文件一大堆","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1120421521/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1120424248","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/3409#issuecomment-1120424248","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3409","id":1120424248,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85CyFE4","user":{"login":"peterxiong13","id":40230517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjMwNTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40230517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterxiong13","html_url":"https://github.com/peterxiong13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterxiong13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterxiong13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterxiong13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterxiong13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterxiong13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterxiong13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterxiong13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterxiong13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterxiong13/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-08T14:00:51Z","updated_at":"2022-05-08T14:00:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"我也碰到此问题了，发现快照过期时很多文件并没有删除掉。用并行方式快照过期会卡住，移除孤儿文件也会卡住","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.

A few things confuse me a little:\r\n\r\n1. This appears to be a standalone kms client implementation, but I don't see how anyone could use this directly without bringing custom code (i.e. we don't dynamically load any of the aws clients individually).\r\n2. This doesn't appear to be implemented in the same pattern as the AWSClientFactory (I see there is a factory method on this implementation, but that's quite different from how other clients are accessed).\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of different configurations with AWS clients and I don't think the intent is to make Iceberg support every option, so it might be better to just maintain your own client factory with customizations like this.\r\n\r\nIf we were to support key generation, it would probably need to be integrated with the AWSClientFactory implementations and configurable via a property, but this seems to be getting into pretty narrow use cases that add additional complexity.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1121304920/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1121309746","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/4718#issuecomment-1121309746","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4718","id":1121309746,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85C1dQy","user":{"login":"abmo-x","id":69539469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NTM5NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69539469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abmo-x","html_url":"https://github.com/abmo-x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abmo-x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abmo-x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abmo-x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abmo-x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abmo-x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abmo-x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abmo-x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abmo-x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abmo-x/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-09T16:20:25Z","updated_at":"2022-05-09T16:20:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @singhpk234  for the quick fix!

Please find my comments as the following:\r\n\r\n1. Default AWS KMS client created by default AWSClientFactory relies on normal AWS credential provider chain which works out of box for typical AWS environment without the need of customoisation. If users need customisation then they can override the `awsKmsClient` method defined in the implementation.  \r\n2. I didn't use `AwsClientFactories.from`  because  AWSClientFactory relies on catalog properties for initialisation but Iceberg Encryption KMS client `initialise` method only brings table properties not catalog properties in the scope.\r\n\r\nIMHO, support key generation or not should be per table configuration and configured via table properties, not sure we should configure via AWSClientFactory . Apologies in advance if I understand you wrongly. Also cc @ggershinsky for more inputs.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1121361248/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
