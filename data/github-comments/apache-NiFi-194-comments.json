Given the Operation I can only generate one kind of error at a time. This looks good though, just want to verify I can get groups of errors then I'll merge\r\n\r\n@mattyb149 my suggestion (although I'll not be in a position to try it for a while), would be to create an index with a numeric field mapping, index a document with a known id, then run the processor in update mode with 2 records - 1 with a mismatched id (should result in a not_found error), the 2nd with the correct id but a non-numeric value for the numeric field (should give a \"format exception\")\r\n\r\nFrom memory, this is the kind of thing I've tried to show in the unit/integration tests\r\n\r\nThis could possibly all be done with a single FlowFile and run off the processor - the index operation can be set by the value of a field within a record. So something like:\r\n\r\n1. Op=index, id=1, fields: foo=\"bar\", baz=1\r\n2. Op=update, id=unknown, fields: foo=\"zap\"\r\n3. Op=update, id=1, fields: baz=\"not a number\"\r\n\r\nIndex=bulk_test, Index Op record path=/Op, id record path=/id\r\n\r\nThat's a chance Elasticsearch will set the \"baz\" fields mapping to string by default, but hopefully it'll choose Integer. If so, we'll need to separately define the index mappings and pre-create the index with an InvokeHTTP call (for example). If you don't get to it first, I'll try to put a Flow Definition together and attach it to the jira ticket as an example","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1683405494/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1683618041","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/7344#issuecomment-1683618041","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/7344","id":1683618041,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5kWfj5","user":{"login":"ferencerdei","id":89379649,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5Mzc5NjQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89379649?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferencerdei","html_url":"https://github.com/ferencerdei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferencerdei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferencerdei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferencerdei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferencerdei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferencerdei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferencerdei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferencerdei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferencerdei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferencerdei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-18T09:18:28Z","updated_at":"2023-08-18T09:18:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you for the effort you put into this change.

From that perspective, there are several create methods that support these operations, so my previous statement was not accurate.\r\n\r\nGiven that the basic purpose of this parameter is to support some types of migration, the question whether to extend the implementation to timestamps, instead of keeping it limited to the author. Preserving the created timestamp might make sense to maintain historical tracking, but it seems like the modified timestamp should reflect the time when the migration operation occurred.\r\n\r\nIs there some particular reason for not wanting to reflect the current timestamp when importing flows?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1688989107/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1689023712","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/7604#issuecomment-1689023712","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/7604","id":1689023712,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5krHTg","user":{"login":"ravinarayansingh","id":8307151,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMDcxNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8307151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravinarayansingh","html_url":"https://github.com/ravinarayansingh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravinarayansingh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravinarayansingh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravinarayansingh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravinarayansingh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravinarayansingh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravinarayansingh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravinarayansingh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravinarayansingh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravinarayansingh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-22T22:47:34Z","updated_at":"2023-08-22T22:47:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Is there some particular reason for not wanting to reflect the current timestamp when importing flows?\r\n\r\nThanks @exceptionfactory for quick response \r\n\r\nNo, there is no specific reason and you are right I should set ModifiedTimestamp with current timestamp.\r\nif  you are agree then I can update the PR with required changes \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1689023712/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1689890883","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/7636#issuecomment-1689890883","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/7636","id":1689890883,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5kubBD","user":{"login":"mr1716","id":9115680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMTU2ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9115680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr1716","html_url":"https://github.com/mr1716","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr1716/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr1716/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr1716/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr1716/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr1716/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr1716/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr1716/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr1716/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr1716/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-23T12:40:05Z","updated_at":"2023-08-23T12:40:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@exceptionfactory thanks.

In both basic and advanced scenarios using RecordPath, both components demonstrated effective functionality. I observed two rooms for improvement during testing:\r\n\r\nLogically, a sink service doesn't seem to align well within a processor package. Even if both are located in the same NAR, it could be valuable to organize these modules into distinct common, processors, and services sections for improved clarity. (summon @turcsanyip)\r\n\r\nTo further enhance the sink, it might be beneficial to implement a caching mechanism within the sink service. This would be particularly relevant in situations where there are numerous identical bulletins in the `BulletinRepository`. In such cases, if the `QueryNifiReporting` task runs with the `ZendeskRecordSink`, it could potentially create multiple identical tickets. Implementing a cache could mitigate this redundancy.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1696561182/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1696802789","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6941#issuecomment-1696802789","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/6941","id":1696802789,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5lIyfl","user":{"login":"malthe","id":26405,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26405?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/malthe","html_url":"https://github.com/malthe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malthe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malthe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malthe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malthe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malthe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malthe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malthe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malthe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malthe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-29T05:41:25Z","updated_at":"2023-08-29T05:41:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@exceptionfactory

Nothing in the Groovy 3x line appears to work with Java 21.  So on main i'm trying for now to move all things to Groovy 4.  The Tinkerpop/graph stuff has an even older relationship with Groovy and seems to be on entirely unsupported lines.  I am finding information gathering on Groovy super tough frankly.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I suggest we remove the groovy support from the graph module entirely.  We should in my view move to a mode whereby the only Groovy bits in our codebase are to allow people to write scripted components in groovy.  No unit tests should be in Groovy and we should eliminate those that are.  I did not realize what a complicated story this gave our build process.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1719643027/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1719650690","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/7691#issuecomment-1719650690","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/7691","id":1719650690,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5mf8mC","user":{"login":"joewitt","id":3057465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTc0NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3057465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt","html_url":"https://github.com/joewitt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-14T15:13:50Z","updated_at":"2023-09-14T15:13:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"reviewing.

We have used groovy because it was the easiest way to interact with: https://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/main/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-graph-bundle/nifi-graph-processors/src/main/java/org/apache/nifi/processors/graph/ExecuteGraphQueryRecord.java \r\n* From a gremlin perspective, pinning the groovy version is really important as all the tinkerpop tooling are built on top of specific groovy versions (as it is all groovy based), so it is causing headaches making specific builds work when it is pinned to the groovy version in tinkerpop. Therefore, flexibility to use a specific groovy version in this component would be really neat. \r\n* As for groovy tests, I am already working on refactoring these and removing all groovy tests\r\n\r\nSo to get to your proposal, I dont have any issues with that as long as I have some guidance on how the ExecuteGraphQueryRecordProcessor will work after that refactor. If you have a PR for me to review that would be immensely helpful.
