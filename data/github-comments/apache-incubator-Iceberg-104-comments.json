Even though compaction is running asynchronously with snapshotState(), it will eventually back up/block the threads executing notifyCheckpointComplete().\r\n\r\nIn the streaming ingestion path, here are a few things we can do or improve to mitigate the small files\r\n1. writer parallelism\r\n2. for partitioned tables, we can use DistributionMode to improve data clustering so that we can avoid that every writer task write to many partitions at the same time. Right now, Flink writer only has support for HASH mode. In the future, RANGE or BINPACKING might be more useful and general. They can also improve query performance with better data clustering.\r\n\r\nEven with above changes, Flink streaming ingestion can still generate small files. The parallel compactors and 2nd committer that Ryan mentioned might be able to keep up with the throughput. However, personally I would rather not over-complicate the streaming ingestion path and make it less stable. Let's get the data into long-term data storage (like Iceberg tables) first.  Other optimizations (like compaction or sorting) can happen in the background with scheduled (Spark) batch jobs.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/892373055/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/892430909","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/2927#issuecomment-892430909","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2927","id":892430909,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX841MWo9","user":{"login":"TangYan-1","id":76996884,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTk2ODg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76996884?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TangYan-1","html_url":"https://github.com/TangYan-1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TangYan-1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TangYan-1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TangYan-1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TangYan-1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TangYan-1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TangYan-1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TangYan-1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TangYan-1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TangYan-1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-04T07:26:58Z","updated_at":"2021-08-04T07:26:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks, @pvary  Seems I can't find any info about set iceberg.mr.catalog in official documentation.
