That is the kind of negative test I have in mind.\r\n\r\nI see. It makes it much easier to address your comments with a clear explanation. Thanks. It should behave the same way as `JSON_VALUE` does. Could you point me to tests that check that behaviour of `JSON_VALUE`? I'll adapt those. If you can't I'll try to write some myself once I am back from my vacation, but I'd really appreciate pointers to existing tests.\r\n\r\n> You can test your commits before submitting with ./gradlew build\r\n\r\nSorry about that, `./gradlew build` fails even on clean master locally for me so it is hard for me to rely on it, but you're right it would've caught the line that was too long. I fixed it.\r\n\r\n```\r\nFAILURE   6.6sec,   22 completed,   1 failed,   3 skipped, org.apache.calcite.adapter.os.OsAdapterTest\r\n          7.0sec, org.apache.calcite.chinook.EndToEndTest > test(String)[1], [1] sql/preferred-for-specific-user.iq\r\n          8.8sec,    4 completed,   0 failed,   0 skipped, org.apache.calcite.chinook.EndToEndTest > test(String)\r\n          8.8sec,    4 completed,   0 failed,   0 skipped, org.apache.calcite.chinook.EndToEndTest\r\n```\r\n\r\nBtw, as a side not. I've not written it before, because I found it unrelated to this PR, but I find this issue: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-6208 a bit useless. You can't really return an `ARRAY` from a `JSON_VALUE`, because it can only produce scalar values (which is in line with SQL standard). See `JsonFunctions#jsonValue` and e.g. https://github.com/apache/calcite/blob/5e837d02d0ba9e0b1e548acb5c218616234936c8/core/src/main/java/org/apache/calcite/runtime/JsonFunctions.java#L292 or

Cloud (formerly SonarCloud) is a SaaS code analysis tool designed to detect coding issues in 30+ languages, frameworks, and IaC platforms.Your code is checked against an extensive set of rules that cover many attributes of code, such as maintainability, reliability, and security issues, on each merge/pull request.\r\n\r\nSonarQube Cloud integrates seamlessly into your GitHub workflow and provides clear guidance for resolving any code quality and security issues detected. The majority of popular languages can be analyzed automatically; no configuration is required!\r\n\r\nWith [SonarQube Cloud](https://sonarcloud.io/github), you get:\r\n\r\n-   Fast, precise static analysis and feedback on your code\r\n    \r\n-   Support for popular languages, frameworks, and IaC tools\r\n    \r\n-   Free analysis for open-source projects and private projects up to max 50k LoC\r\n    \r\n-   Automatic analysis of pull requests and branches with results reported inline\r\n    \r\n-   IDE Support with [SonarQube for IDE](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarlint/) integration\r\n    \r\n-   Quality Gate (added as a GitHub check) acting at two different levels - first, preventing you from merging pull requests that contain issues - and later, helping you to release only clean, safe code\r\n    \r\n-   Sign up for SonarQube free tier and begin scanning your private and public repositories\r\n    \r\n\r\nA [GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/sonarcloud-scan) is available in the marketplace to make it easy for you (for projects where automatic analysis isn't available). SonarQube Cloud also integrates smoothly with Jenkins, CircleCI, TravisCI, CirrusCI, and many other tools.\r\n\r\nA free tier is available that allows you to explore the benefits of SonarQube Cloud using your public and private repositories. We also provide a no-commitment, [14-day trial](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarcloud/signup/) of SonarQube Cloud Team for unlimited team members, up to 1.9M LoC, AI CodeFix recommendations, and more. No need to speak with a sales rep or request a license key - get automatic code analysis results on your private projects in minutes! Want to see more examples of SonarCloud in action?

Cloud (formerly SonarCloud) is a SaaS code analysis tool designed to detect coding issues in 30+ languages, frameworks, and IaC platforms.Your code is checked against an extensive set of rules that cover many attributes of code, such as maintainability, reliability, and security issues, on each merge/pull request.\r\n\r\nSonarQube Cloud integrates seamlessly into your GitHub workflow and provides clear guidance for resolving any code quality and security issues detected. The majority of popular languages can be analyzed automatically; no configuration is required!\r\n\r\nWith [SonarQube Cloud](https://sonarcloud.io/github), you get:\r\n\r\n-   Fast, precise static analysis and feedback on your code\r\n    \r\n-   Support for popular languages, frameworks, and IaC tools\r\n    \r\n-   Free analysis for open-source projects and private projects up to max 50k LoC\r\n    \r\n-   Automatic analysis of pull requests and branches with results reported inline\r\n    \r\n-   IDE Support with [SonarQube for IDE](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarlint/) integration\r\n    \r\n-   Quality Gate (added as a GitHub check) acting at two different levels - first, preventing you from merging pull requests that contain issues - and later, helping you to release only clean, safe code\r\n    \r\n-   Sign up for SonarQube free tier and begin scanning your private and public repositories\r\n    \r\n\r\nA [GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/sonarcloud-scan) is available in the marketplace to make it easy for you (for projects where automatic analysis isn't available).
