Something to try to prevent such an error in the future.\r\n> \r\n> What about a test? Did you try to write a unit test to catch this? I think having 4 available workers, create a log, and then look at the raft groups and see that it has 4 members instead of 3 would work.\r\n\r\nSorry, it took so long to reply to you. about the log service, it is okay to verify according to the document (because the number of worker nodes is equal to the number of new raft groups), but when more than 3 worker nodes are started, a log is created at the time, the metadata service will broadcast the addition of Raft groups to unnecessary nodes outside the new raft group. \r\nPersonal suggestion: Ratis server adds verification. when an additional raft group is received, verify that the new raft group members must contain the current working node","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/comments/641847686/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/comments/642136277","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ratis/pull/120#issuecomment-642136277","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/120","id":642136277,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MjEzNjI3Nw==","user":{"login":"anshkhannasbu","id":54566284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NTY2Mjg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54566284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshkhannasbu","html_url":"https://github.com/anshkhannasbu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshkhannasbu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshkhannasbu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshkhannasbu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshkhannasbu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshkhannasbu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshkhannasbu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshkhannasbu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshkhannasbu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshkhannasbu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-10T16:57:18Z","updated_at":"2020-06-10T16:57:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @lokeshj1703 @bshashikant, can you guys review this?

\r\n\r\nThe concern here is we need consider the atomicity of reading role and reading term.\r\n\r\nFor leader case, `LeaderState` has its member `private final long currentTerm;`, which is read only, meanwhile `RoleInfo` has its member `AtomicReference<LeaderState> leaderState`, which is an atomic variable, thus current `getRoleInfoProto()` can ensure the atomicity of reading role and reading term together.\r\n\r\nBut for candidate and follower, since `LeaderElection` and `FollowerState` does not record currentTerm. If we want to ensure of atomicity, we need lock entire `RaftServerImpl` to read role and call `getState().getCurrentTerm()`. But I didn't see the requirement of return candidate and follower with its term.

in production cluster because the lock of DataBlockingQueue can not be free, the related jira is [RATIS-1004](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/RATIS-1004) and jstack file has been attached in
