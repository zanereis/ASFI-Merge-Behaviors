I think it is in a good direction. But I have a different thought about the interface. Technically producers shouldn't be aware of and care about the schema version when it produces a message. It should just use different schemas to send the messages and Pulsar clients should handle all the remaining logic.\r\n\r\nThe interface that I would be proposing is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<V> TypedMessageBuilder<V> newMessage(Schema<V> schema);\r\n```\r\n\r\n- it hides the schema version details from end-user\r\n- it allows applications to produce different POJOs using same producer.\r\n\r\nIn the implementation, Producer should maintain a map between schema and the schema version. If the schema is already registered, producer is able to find the schema version and attach the schema version when sending out the message. If the schema is not registered, it will register the schema and get the schema version. So any subsequent produce requests using that schema can use the right schema version. \r\n\r\nThis may require adding a new command in Pulsar wire protocol for registering a new schema.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIn any case, since this feature requires changing/adding public interface and (potentially) modify the wire protocol, can you write a PIP and start an email thread for discussing this PIP at dev@pulsar.apache.org

Start a Mongo service.\r\n\r\n    ```bash\r\n    docker pull mongo:4\r\n    docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name pulsar-mongo -v $PWD/data:/data/db mongo:4\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n2. Create a DB and a collection.\r\n\r\n    ```bash\r\n    docker exec -it pulsar-mongo /bin/bash\r\n    mongo\r\n    > use pulsar\r\n    > db.createCollection('messages')\r\n    > exit\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n3. Start Pulsar standalone.\r\n\r\n    ```bash\r\n    docker pull apachepulsar/pulsar:2.4.0\r\n    docker run -d -it -p 6650:6650 -p 8080:8080 -v $PWD/data:/pulsar/data --link pulsar-mongo --name pulsar-mongo-standalone apachepulsar/pulsar:2.4.0 bin/pulsar standalone\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n4. Configure the Mongo sink with the `mongo-sink-config.yaml` file.\r\n\r\n    ```bash\r\n    configs:\r\n    mongoUri: \"mongodb://pulsar-mongo:27017\"\r\n    database: \"pulsar\"\r\n    collection: \"messages\"\r\n    batchSize: 2\r\n    batchTimeMs: 500\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    ```bash\r\n    docker cp mongo-sink-config.yaml pulsar-mongo-standalone:/pulsar/\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n5. Download the Mongo sink nar package.\r\n\r\n    ```bash\r\n    docker exec -it pulsar-mongo-standalone /bin/bash\r\n    curl -O http://apache.01link.hk/pulsar/pulsar-2.4.0/connectors/pulsar-io-mongo-2.4.0.nar\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n## Debug in localrun mode\r\n\r\nStart the Mongo sink in localrun mode using the `localrun` command.\r\n\r\n> #### Tip\r\n> \r\n> For more information about the `localrun` command, see [`localrun`](reference-connector-admin.md/#localrun-1).\r\n\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./bin/pulsar-admin sinks localrun \\\r\n--archive pulsar-io-mongo-2.4.0.nar \\ \r\n--tenant public --namespace default \\\r\n--inputs test-mongo \\\r\n--name pulsar-mongo-sink \\\r\n--sink-config-file mongo-sink-config.yaml \\\r\n--parallelism 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Use connector log\r\n\r\nUse one of the following methods to get a connector log in localrun mode:\r\n\r\n* After executing the `localrun` command, the **log is automatically printed on the console**.\r\n\r\n* The log is located at:\r\n  \r\n    ```bash\r\n    logs/functions/tenant/namespace/function-name/function-name-instance-id.log\r\n    ```\r\n    \r\n    **Example**\r\n    \r\n    The path of the Mongo sink connector is:\r\n\r\n    ```bash\r\n    logs/functions/public/default/pulsar-mongo-sink/pulsar-mongo-sink-0.log\r\n    ```\r\n\r\nTo clearly explain the log information, here breaks down the large block of information into small blocks and add descriptions for each block.\r\n\r\n* This piece of log information shows the storage path of the nar package after decompression.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    08:21:54.132 [main] INFO  org.apache.pulsar.common.nar.NarClassLoader -

To find the log path of a specified connector, use the `workerId` to locate the connector log.\r\n\r\n### Use admin CLI\r\n\r\nPulsar admin CLI helps you debug Pulsar connectors with the following subcommands:\r\n\r\n* [`get`](#get)\r\n  \r\n* [`status`](#status)\r\n\r\n* [`topics stats`](#topics-stats)\r\n\r\n**Create a Mongo sink**\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./bin/pulsar-admin sinks create \\\r\n--archive pulsar-io-mongo-2.4.0.nar \\\r\n--tenant public \\\r\n--namespace default \\\r\n--inputs test-mongo \\\r\n--name pulsar-mongo-sink \\\r\n--sink-config-file mongo-sink-config.yaml \\\r\n--parallelism 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### `get`\r\n\r\nUse the `get` command to get the basic information about the Mongo sink connector, such as tenant, namespace, name, parallelism, and so on.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./bin/pulsar-admin sinks get --tenant public --namespace default  --name pulsar-mongo-sink\r\n{\r\n  \"tenant\": \"public\",\r\n  \"namespace\": \"default\",\r\n  \"name\": \"pulsar-mongo-sink\",\r\n  \"className\": \"org.apache.pulsar.io.mongodb.MongoSink\",\r\n  \"inputSpecs\": {\r\n    \"test-mongo\": {\r\n      \"isRegexPattern\": false\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  \"configs\": {\r\n    \"mongoUri\": \"mongodb://pulsar-mongo:27017\",\r\n    \"database\": \"pulsar\",\r\n    \"collection\": \"messages\",\r\n    \"batchSize\": 2.0,\r\n    \"batchTimeMs\": 500.0\r\n  },\r\n  \"parallelism\": 1,\r\n  \"processingGuarantees\": \"ATLEAST_ONCE\",\r\n  \"retainOrdering\": false,\r\n  \"autoAck\": true\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n> #### Tip\r\n> \r\n> For more information about the `get` command, see [`get`](reference-connector-admin.md/#get-1).\r\n\r\n### `status`\r\n\r\nUse the `status` command to get the current status about the Mongo sink connector, such as the number of instance, the number of running instance, instanceId, workerId and so on.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./bin/pulsar-admin sinks status \r\n--tenant public \\\r\n--namespace default  \\\r\n--name pulsar-mongo-sink\r\n\r\n{\r\n\"numInstances\" : 1,\r\n\"numRunning\" : 1,\r\n\"instances\" : [ {\r\n    \"instanceId\" : 0,\r\n    \"status\" : {\r\n    \"running\" : true,\r\n    \"error\" : \"\",\r\n    \"numRestarts\" : 0,\r\n    \"numReadFromPulsar\" : 0,\r\n    \"numSystemExceptions\" : 0,\r\n    \"latestSystemExceptions\" : [ ],\r\n    \"numSinkExceptions\" : 0,\r\n    \"latestSinkExceptions\" : [ ],\r\n    \"numWrittenToSink\" : 0,\r\n    \"lastReceivedTime\" : 0,\r\n    \"workerId\" : \"c-standalone-fw-5d202832fd18-8080\"\r\n    }\r\n} ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n> #### Tip\r\n> \r\n> For more information about the `status` command, see [`status`](reference-connector-admin.md/#stauts-1).\r\n> \r\n> If there are multiple connectors running on a worker, `workerId` can locate the worker on which the specified connector is running.\r\n\r\n### `topics stats`\r\n\r\nUse the `topics stats` command to get the stats for a topic and its connected producer and consumer, such as whether the topic has received messages or not, whether there is a backlog of messages or not, the available permits and other key information. All rates are computed over a 1-minute window and are relative to the last completed 1-minute period.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./bin/pulsar-admin topics stats test-mongo\r\n{\r\n  \"msgRateIn\" : 0.0,\r\n  \"msgThroughputIn\" : 0.0,\r\n  \"msgRateOut\" : 0.0,\r\n  \"msgThroughputOut\" : 0.0,\r\n  \"averageMsgSize\" : 0.0,\r\n  \"storageSize\" : 1,\r\n  \"publishers\" : [ ],\r\n  \"subscriptions\" : {\r\n    \"public/default/pulsar-mongo-sink\" : {\r\n      \"msgRateOut\" : 0.0,\r\n      \"msgThroughputOut\" : 0.0,\r\n      \"msgRateRedeliver\" : 0.0,\r\n      \"msgBacklog\" : 0,\r\n      \"blockedSubscriptionOnUnackedMsgs\" : false,\r\n      \"msgDelayed\" : 0,\r\n      \"unackedMessages\" : 0,\r\n      \"type\" : \"Shared\",\r\n      \"msgRateExpired\" : 0.0,\r\n      \"consumers\" : [ {\r\n        \"msgRateOut\" : 0.0,\r\n        \"msgThroughputOut\" : 0.0,\r\n        \"msgRateRedeliver\" : 0.0,\r\n        \"consumerName\" : \"dffdd\",\r\n        \"availablePermits\" : 999,\r\n        \"unackedMessages\" : 0,\r\n        \"blockedConsumerOnUnackedMsgs\" : false,\r\n        \"metadata\" : {\r\n          \"instance_id\" : \"0\",\r\n          \"application\" : \"pulsar-sink\",\r\n          \"id\" : \"public/default/pulsar-mongo-sink\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"connectedSince\" : \"2019-08-26T08:48:07.582Z\",\r\n        \"clientVersion\" : \"2.4.0\",\r\n        \"address\" : \"/172.17.0.3:57790\"\r\n      } ],\r\n      \"isReplicated\" : false\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  \"replication\" : { },\r\n  \"deduplicationStatus\" : \"Disabled\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n> #### Tip\r\n> \r\n> For more information about the `topic status` command, see [`topic status`](pulsar-admin/#stats-1).\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\nThis checklist indicates the major areas to check when you debug connectors. It is a reminder of what to look for to ensure a thorough review and an evaluation tool to get the status of connectors. \r\n\r\n* Does Pulsar start successfully?\r\n  \r\n* Does the external service run normally?\r\n  \r\n* Is the nar package complete?\r\n  \r\n* Is the connector configuration file correct?\r\n  \r\n* In localrun mode, run a connector and check the printed information (connector log) on the console.\r\n  \r\n* In cluster mode：\r\n  \r\n   * Use the `get` command to get the basic information.\r\n  \r\n   * Use the `status` command to get the current status.\r\n\r\n   * Use the `topics stats` command to get the stats for a specified topic and its connected producers and consumers.\r\n  \r\n   * Check the connector log.\r\n\r\n* Enter into the external system and verify the result.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/525724849/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/525845153","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/5058#issuecomment-525845153","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/5058","id":525845153,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNTg0NTE1Mw==","user":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-28T17:32:53Z","updated_at":"2019-08-28T17:32:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"run
