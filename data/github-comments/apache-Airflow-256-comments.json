I don't care about this I was just adding it to be consistent with with existing hook, in which pretty much every attribute was overridable in init.  There was already `password`, so an invitation to be a knucklehead already exists ;).  If you want to remove this init param I have absolutely no objection.\r\n\r\nBut concerning allowing private key to be provided directly in airflow connection, as opposed to only key file `path`, I assume you do not mean to object to that.  There is absolutely no difference between providing a private key here and `keyfile_dict` in GCP, or `password` in _any_ other conn uri.  The connection framework is fundamental to airflow and if we object to that, then we object to all hooks.  Moreover I think the case is strong that to require distributing keys across all nodes -- in other words adding special extra processing relative to other connection types -- rather _increases_ likelihood of security lapses relative to just being able to lean on the connection framework alone.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it makes sense to make a new PR with your proposed change and we can discuss there?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/532965215/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/532974905","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6145#issuecomment-532974905","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6145","id":532974905,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMjk3NDkwNQ==","user":{"login":"K3UL","id":4669258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NjkyNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4669258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/K3UL","html_url":"https://github.com/K3UL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/K3UL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/K3UL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/K3UL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/K3UL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/K3UL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/K3UL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/K3UL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/K3UL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/K3UL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-19T05:40:12Z","updated_at":"2019-09-19T05:40:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@mik-laj Ah !
