 你好. 請問一下你改的 master branch 是指主分支 2.7.x 嗎?  我測試是使用 2.6.6 的代碼進行修改的. 註冊中心使用的是 zookeeper.  consumer 設定 timeout 為 10分鐘, 我並沒有對 2.7.x 版進行調整並測試這個問題.  \r\n本地目前在 2.6.6 調整完 HeaderExchangeChannel.close() 內先調用 DefaultFuture.closeChannel(channel); 或者選擇改 在 finally 才調用 DefaultFuture.closeChannel(channel);  都是可以在 consumer 送出請求後, 等到 provider 接入後, 刪除 provider 進程,  consumer 都可以在幾秒內收到拋出的 \"Channel xx is inactive. Directly return the unFinished request\" 異常.  在未調整前. 我的 consumer 都是要等到 10 分鐘後才能得到一個 timeout exception.\r\n接著 大概需要幾天的時間 我會先把自己改過的版本 放置我們 測試區 進行驗證. 隨後會再往前推進到我們的正式的生產環境.\r\n(補充說明. 其實還有幾隻 dubbo 尋找 class loader 的代碼, 我是有特別修改為從當前線程取得 class loader , 但我認為不應該這幾隻修改, 會影響我本次測試的結果.)\r\n\r\n以上的信息
