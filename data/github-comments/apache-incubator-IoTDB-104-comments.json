The majority of popular languages can be analyzed automatically; no configuration is required!\r\n\r\nWith [SonarQube Cloud](https://sonarcloud.io/github), you get:\r\n\r\n-   Fast, precise static analysis and feedback on your code\r\n    \r\n-   Support for popular languages, frameworks, and IaC tools\r\n    \r\n-   Free analysis for open-source projects and private projects up to max 50k LoC\r\n    \r\n-   Automatic analysis of pull requests and branches with results reported inline\r\n    \r\n-   IDE Support with [SonarQube for IDE](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarlint/) integration\r\n    \r\n-   Quality Gate (added as a GitHub check) acting at two different levels - first, preventing you from merging pull requests that contain issues - and later, helping you to release only clean, safe code\r\n    \r\n-   Sign up for SonarQube free tier and begin scanning your private and public repositories\r\n    \r\n\r\nA [GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/sonarcloud-scan) is available in the marketplace to make it easy for you (for projects where automatic analysis isn't available). SonarQube Cloud also integrates smoothly with Jenkins, CircleCI, TravisCI, CirrusCI, and many other tools.\r\n\r\nA free tier is available that allows you to explore the benefits of SonarQube Cloud using your public and private repositories. We also provide a no-commitment, [14-day trial](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarcloud/signup/) of SonarQube Cloud Team for unlimited team members, up to 1.9M LoC, AI CodeFix recommendations, and more. No need to speak with a sales rep or request a license key - get automatic code analysis results on your private projects in minutes! Want to see more examples of SonarCloud in action? You can [explore current Open Source projects in SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io/explore/projects?sort=-analysis_date) that are using the [Clean as You Code](https://www.sonarsource.com/solutions/our-unique-approach/) methodology.\r\n\r\nWhat are you waiting for?

This command will read all tsfile in all data directory because we can't know which file has unsorted data.

device，会按照device顺序进行输出，内存占用会降低至单device级别。","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/1909525015/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/1909727020","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iotdb/issues/11967#issuecomment-1909727020","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/11967","id":1909727020,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCXnElM5x1B8s","user":{"login":"myysophia","id":25994521,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTk0NTIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25994521?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myysophia","html_url":"https://github.com/myysophia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myysophia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myysophia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myysophia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myysophia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myysophia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myysophia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myysophia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myysophia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myysophia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-25T09:19:57Z","updated_at":"2024-01-25T09:19:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"3q","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/1909727020/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/1909727528","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iotdb/issues/11967#issuecomment-1909727528","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/11967","id":1909727528,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCXnElM5x1CEo","user":{"login":"myysophia","id":25994521,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTk0NTIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25994521?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myysophia","html_url":"https://github.com/myysophia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myysophia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myysophia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myysophia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myysophia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myysophia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myysophia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myysophia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myysophia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myysophia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-25T09:20:13Z","updated_at":"2024-01-25T09:20:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/1909727528/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/1910298745","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iotdb/issues/11952#issuecomment-1910298745","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/11952","id":1910298745,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCXnElM5x3Nh5","user":{"login":"JackieTien97","id":16079446,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDc5NDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16079446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JackieTien97","html_url":"https://github.com/JackieTien97","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JackieTien97/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JackieTien97/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JackieTien97/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JackieTien97/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JackieTien97/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JackieTien97/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JackieTien97/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JackieTien97/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JackieTien97/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-25T14:14:06Z","updated_at":"2024-01-25T14:14:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"我用你的JDBC程序试了一下，并没有复现。是对于JDBC程序运行的时间有要求吗？我看你的JDBC程序是写了死循环一直写的。","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/1910298745/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hoora

The majority of popular languages can be analyzed automatically; no configuration is required!\r\n\r\nWith [SonarQube Cloud](https://sonarcloud.io/github), you get:\r\n\r\n-   Fast, precise static analysis and feedback on your code\r\n    \r\n-   Support for popular languages, frameworks, and IaC tools\r\n    \r\n-   Free analysis for open-source projects and private projects up to max 50k LoC\r\n    \r\n-   Automatic analysis of pull requests and branches with results reported inline\r\n    \r\n-   IDE Support with [SonarQube for IDE](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarlint/) integration\r\n    \r\n-   Quality Gate (added as a GitHub check) acting at two different levels - first, preventing you from merging pull requests that contain issues - and later, helping you to release only clean, safe code\r\n    \r\n-   Sign up for SonarQube free tier and begin scanning your private and public repositories\r\n    \r\n\r\nA [GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/sonarcloud-scan) is available in the marketplace to make it easy for you (for projects where automatic analysis isn't available). SonarQube Cloud also integrates smoothly with Jenkins, CircleCI, TravisCI, CirrusCI, and many other tools.\r\n\r\nA free tier is available that allows you to explore the benefits of SonarQube Cloud using your public and private repositories. We also provide a no-commitment, [14-day trial](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarcloud/signup/) of SonarQube Cloud Team for unlimited team members, up to 1.9M LoC, AI CodeFix recommendations, and more.
