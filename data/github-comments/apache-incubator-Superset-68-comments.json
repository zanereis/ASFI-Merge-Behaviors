Try to make BQ comply to what it needs to go through the `sqla` route in Superset. This requires essentially 2 things:\r\n* a SqlAlchemy dialect, that's easy-ish assuming that BQ SQL is close enough to ANSI SQL. Note that we only need a subset of the dialect defined, only the query part and the method to fetch metadata (tables, columns, views, ...)\r\n* a DBAPI interface: DBAPI is a python standard for how database interfaces should look like. connections and cursor objects, and a set of standard methods. \r\n\r\nThe pyhive project does both these things on top of both Presto and Hive and can be a source or inspiration here.\r\n\r\n2. The second approach would be to create a new big_query package under `connectors`, and create a brand new connector. This approach is a lot more flexible but it's much more code to write and maintain, and only helps Superset (where SQLALchemy/DBApi) helps BigQuery integration in other tools...\r\n\r\nThis has been discussed here:\r\nhttps://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-python/issues/2434","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/301257388/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/301278986","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/1231#issuecomment-301278986","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/1231","id":301278986,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMTI3ODk4Ng==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-13T22:38:10Z","updated_at":"2017-05-13T22:38:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I worked on integrating a headless browser to render chart images but never got around to finish the work:\r\nhttps://github.com/mistercrunch/superset/tree/phantom\r\n\r\nIf someone want to take over this branch, wrap things up and submit a PR you're welcomed to do so.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/301278986/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/301279240","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/2687#issuecomment-301279240","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/2687","id":301279240,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMTI3OTI0MA==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-13T22:44:46Z","updated_at":"2017-05-13T22:44:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"You get this on all time series line charts?

Do you have historical nodes setup? Does the segment metadata endpoint return column and type information? \r\n\r\nSuperset uses the segment metadata feature in Druid to provide the information it needs. The question of \"how do I get version X of Druid to show segment metadata\" really is a Druid question. The answer is probably to find a way for Druid to create the physical segment, or to upgrade Druid, though that's a question for the Druid community.\r\n\r\nFYI at Airbnb we have a framework that makes it easy to load data from our Kafka topics into Druid that works along with our logging framework which uses Thrift to serialize and as a way to enforce schemas. In our case this framework creates the Superset datasources in an alternative way (not using the segment metadata endpoint) and that allows us to have more control over things with a script that is more specific.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/301856312/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/301860413","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/2655#issuecomment-301860413","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/2655","id":301860413,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMTg2MDQxMw==","user":{"login":"ShengyaoQian","id":3270448,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNzA0NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3270448?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShengyaoQian","html_url":"https://github.com/ShengyaoQian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShengyaoQian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShengyaoQian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShengyaoQian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShengyaoQian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShengyaoQian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShengyaoQian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShengyaoQian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShengyaoQian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShengyaoQian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-16T17:46:47Z","updated_at":"2017-05-16T17:46:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@mistercrunch ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/301860413/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/301941404","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/2736#issuecomment-301941404","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/2736","id":301941404,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMTk0MTQwNA==","user":{"login":"joshwalters","id":1214370,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQzNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214370?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshwalters","html_url":"https://github.com/joshwalters","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshwalters/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshwalters/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshwalters/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshwalters/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshwalters/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshwalters/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshwalters/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshwalters/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshwalters/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-16T23:16:57Z","updated_at":"2017-05-16T23:16:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@kkalyan Yes, that does work.

Here are a few thoughts:\r\n\r\n* the representation could be a simple text and a subtle edit icon\r\n* if no specific time is select (`00:00:00`) I wouldn't show it, just show what is relevant.\r\n* clicking the edit icon would pop a small bootstrap popover to the right of the text\r\n* inside the popover a radio button for fixed/relative\r\n* fixed would go along with the nicest react datepicker you can find, it has to allow date and time\r\n* relative would be perhaps 3 boxes\r\n    * an input box that validates numeric\r\n    * a time unit dropdown (`seconds`, `minutes`, `hours`, `days`, `weeks`, `months`, `years`), default to `days`\r\n    * dropdown for `ago` or `from now`, defaults to `ago`\r\n* clicking the form controls in the popover flips the radio button accordingly to save a click. meaning if you click the time unit dropdown, it selects the `relative` option for the radiobutton, or if you click any part of the date picker, it chooses the `fixed` option\r\n* [probably out of scope], an option for UTC / timezones when using fixed dates\r\n\r\nFor an example of a rich control, check out this branch (unmerged) where I'm working on a popover for the `metrics` control.\r\nhttps://github.com/airbnb/superset/compare/metrics...mistercrunch:metrics?expand=1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/302161086/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/302162219","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/2771#issuecomment-302162219","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/2771","id":302162219,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMjE2MjIxOQ==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-17T17:19:59Z","updated_at":"2017-05-17T17:19:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"You
