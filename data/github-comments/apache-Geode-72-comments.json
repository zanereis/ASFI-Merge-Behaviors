Thanks for pointing this out and lots of other valuable information. Also, thank you for the extensive testing you have done.\r\n\r\nIf we decide to go with this solution, I agree that we should make the load-poll-interval parameter configurable for gateway receivers. Changing it to the lower value would slightly mitigate race condition effects.\r\n\r\nThe load-balance gateways command is working on server this way:\r\n- pauses gateway-sender\r\n- destroys all connections and then rely upon the mechanism used during connection creation (ClientConnectionRequest/Response) to do the better load balancing\r\n- resume gateway-sender\r\n\r\nThis command will result again in the burst of connection requests that could hit an issue caused by a race condition. \r\n\r\nMaybe instead of sending load information periodically from the servers, the locator could scrape it (perhaps using CacheServerMXBean) from the servers and apply it simultaneously for all receivers in the locator. The locator could get load when it receives a connection request, and the current connection load is stale (e.g., older than 200 ms), as we don't expect many connections from gateway-senders. This way, the locator would at least have an up-to-date connection load taken at a similar time on all servers. This solution should even catch the change in connection load when the load-balance command destroys all connections.\r\n\r\nMaybe, an algorithm that could work this way:\r\n- Connection request received, check if a connection load is stale (older than new parameter load-update-frequency=200ms)\r\n  - if yes, then try to get connection load from all servers asynchronously\r\n    - if received load from all servers, then apply it in the locator\r\n    - if any get fails, then check profiles again and immediately retry for all servers\r\n  - Use immediately the current load\r\n- If the connection request is not received, then just periodically get load, e.g., every 5 seconds (load-poll-interval)\r\n\r\nNot sure if this makes any sense as I don't know how fast locator can scrape the load. I can create a prototype if you see that this could maybe work?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/1072272422/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/1072621472","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/7443#issuecomment-1072621472","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/7443","id":1072621472,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAhObV84_7ueg","user":{"login":"mhansonp","id":26558973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTU4OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26558973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp","html_url":"https://github.com/mhansonp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-18T17:18:39Z","updated_at":"2022-03-18T17:18:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks good.

Geode's ResourceManager is a singleton and it will only have one instance of HeapUsageProvider. Geode has an implementation of HeapUsageProvider on the class path but it is not a service. Geode's instance handles all the JVMs and GCs we support. The only reason for defining a service that implements HeapUsageProvider is if you want to replace geode's built in one. So at that point you will have two on the class path and only the service one will be used.\r\nIf you define multiple services that implement HeapUsageProvider then only the first one returned by the ServiceLoader will be constructed and used. We could just document this behavior. I don't see a need to make it more complicated.
