play devil's advocate, by that logic, one could just have one single configuration for everything in streams and an enum that could delegate the parameters where necessary. I simply, and made back-wards compatible, a configuration that is tailored to each end-point that one could pull from Twitter. This allows for clarity of usage by the caller and ensures erroneous parameters aren't possible to be constructed which would be implicitly ignored by the the operation. \n\nIE: Tracking a stream for keyword, would be different than tracking individuals by ID. This is reflected in Twitter's API documentation. To mirror these parameters ensures the caller can use the module without having to have explicit knowledge of the inner workings of the provider. \n\nI hope that this isn't too far reaching, but code clarity seems of upmost importance to ensure proper adoption by a wider community.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/streams/issues/comments/42237930/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/streams/issues/comments/42249303","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/streams/pull/8#issuecomment-42249303","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/streams/issues/8","id":42249303,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMjQ5MzAz","user":{"login":"mfranklin","id":1291219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTEyMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1291219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfranklin","html_url":"https://github.com/mfranklin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfranklin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfranklin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfranklin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfranklin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfranklin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfranklin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfranklin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfranklin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfranklin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-05-05T22:39:08Z","updated_at":"2014-05-05T22:39:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Overall, lots of great improvements.

However, there are a few issues I see with it right off the bat:\n\n1) It includes commits from another author.  Your pull requests should only contain your code.\n2) It addresses more than one issue.  Please submit 1 pull request for 1 issue.  It is very difficult for us to review, test and validate the changes if they touch separate functional issues.  Things like the tests are great, but we need those added separately than a fix for the monitor threads not shutting down.\n3) The addition of isRunning and shutdown to the StreamsResultSet breaks the pattern of a ResultSet.  Granted, the class is documented poorly, so the intent may have gotten lost, but having a Result Set manage a shared data structure does not seem correct.  If you wanted to add or change the provider pattern to be shared queue based, then I would propose it to the list, get consensus (or lazy consensus) and then provide an implementation.  Since the pattern was already established, the community needs to have the opportunity to discuss before changing what is there.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/streams/issues/comments/43500256/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/streams/issues/comments/43501875","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/streams/pull/12#issuecomment-43501875","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/streams/issues/12","id":43501875,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNTAxODc1","user":{"login":"mfranklin","id":1291219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTEyMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1291219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfranklin","html_url":"https://github.com/mfranklin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfranklin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfranklin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfranklin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfranklin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfranklin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfranklin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfranklin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfranklin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfranklin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-05-19T13:24:22Z","updated_at":"2014-05-19T13:24:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@steveblackmon Checking to make sure you saw this was reviewed.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/streams/issues/comments/43501875/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/streams/issues/comments/43510043","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/streams/pull/16#issuecomment-43510043","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/streams/issues/16","id":43510043,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNTEwMDQz","user":{"login":"smashew","id":1704705,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDQ3MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1704705?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smashew","html_url":"https://github.com/smashew","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smashew/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smashew/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smashew/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smashew/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smashew/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smashew/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smashew/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smashew/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smashew/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-05-19T14:22:04Z","updated_at":"2014-05-19T14:22:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mfranklin Thank you very much for your comments as always. \n\nUnfortunately, work demands will unfortunately delay my ability to conform to these requirements at this time.

First, you might be able to get away without explicitly using classifiers since no one is depending on your test sources.  Instead you'll use dynamic profile activation.\n\nIn the past I've worked on projects that need to conditionally add source to a project based on the JDK being used.  In our case it was Java 1.5 versus Java 1.6, but the same should apply here.\n\nBasically, what you want to do is setup a profile that is automatically activated based on the jdk.  For instance:\n\n```\n<profile>\n    <id>java7</id>\n    <activation>\n        <jdk>[1.7,]</jdk>\n    </activation>\n    ....\n```\n\nIn this case, the java7 profile would only be activated when running with Java 1.7 or up.\n\nWhat you can then do is create a new folder src/test/java17/ that will contain the tests that require Java 1.7 or up to execute.  Then in your java7 profile, you can use the [build-helper-maven-plugin](http://mojo.codehaus.org/build-helper-maven-plugin/add-test-source-mojo.html)'s add-test-source goal to add your new folder.\n\nAll told, your new profile would be something like this:\n\n```\n    <profile>\n      <id>java7</id>\n      <activation>\n        <jdk>[1.7,]</jdk>\n      </activation>\n      <build>\n        <plugins>\n          <plugin>\n            <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>\n            <artifactId>build-helper-maven-plugin</artifactId>\n            <version>${helper.version}</version>\n            <executions>\n              <execution>\n                <id>add-test-source</id>\n                <phase>generate-sources</phase>\n                <goals>\n                  <goal>add-test-source</goal>\n                </goals>\n                <configuration>\n                  <sources>\n                    <source>src/test/java17</source>\n                  </sources>\n                </configuration>\n              </execution>\n            </executions>\n          </plugin>\n        </plugins>\n      </build>\n    </profile>\n```\n\nAnd that's it.  Btw, I didn't test this, so my syntax may be a bit off.
