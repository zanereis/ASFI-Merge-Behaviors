It's weird that we accept Strings, but not small Longs if the type is `Int`\r\n\r\n@ijuma Not sure I totally agree. I think we get into annoyingly complex and dangerous territory if we accept arbitrary conversions. String conversions are basically required because we need to accept configs from properties files/connect configurations/etc. Other numeric coercion isn't strictly required, and gets annoying complex. And most errors are caught trivially (e.g., forget to put an `L` on that long? Any trivial test will catch it for you).\r\n\r\nIn general, I think we should shy away from trying to rectify the types of arbitrary `Map<String, ?>` configs -- I understand why that type was used, but it creates a huge parsing/conversion mess.\r\n\r\nSince this PR was more about the unclear error messages, I'd suggest merging as is (perhaps with a clarification re: shorts, which I agree may not be accessible to all audiences that may want to use Kafka) and addressing any further refinements in parsing/conversion in a follow up JIRA.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/275019268/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/275031686","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2429#issuecomment-275031686","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2429","id":275031686,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NTAzMTY4Ng==","user":{"login":"mjsax","id":8959638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NTk2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8959638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax","html_url":"https://github.com/mjsax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-25T06:43:31Z","updated_at":"2017-01-25T06:43:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"One more general comment:\r\n\r\nThis RS raised the thought, that our standby task configuration is rather \"all or nothing\".

I think in many cases we should favor the latter over the former, but it seems we are only favoring that until the client has number of assigned tasks equal to the number of threads?\r\n\r\n>For example, say we have two client with one thread (hence one capacity) each and four tasks, and each client is assigned two tasks (1, 2), (3, 4); say a new topic is discovered an a new rebalance is triggered with no tasks added and no members changed, is it possible that we will then get (1, 3) and (2, 4) since each client runs over capacity?\r\n\r\nI've changed it so that it will tend to favour sticky ness more, so the scenario you have mentioned wont happen. In this case the previous assignments will stay the same, but 1 of the clients will get the new task.\r\n\r\n@mjsax, regarding your general comment - as discussed offline i think this is a task for another JIRA.

It seems that once all clients are over capacity then we just treat them equally when assigning (assuming no prev standby / active tasks considered).

Just to be sure, did you mean checking only join related APIs of `KStream/KTable` or all applicable APIs? So, are we going to treat `drop-null `behaviour to all APIs? For example, I see that flatmap (`KStreamFlatMapProcessor`) does not check for `null`. So, if we try to behave similar (avoid `null` keys) in all `Processors` I think we should avoid code replication.
