This is actually two fixes in one:\r\n\r\n  1. Avro should not be in `flink-dist`, because starting with `org.apache.flink`, it would always be loaded *\"parent first\"*. That causes problems because Avro classes exist multiple times, both in the parent and in the child classloader, failing equality and 'instanceof' comparisons.\r\n\r\n  2. The Avro Utils were never using any code in the user code jar, only code in the classpath.\r\n\r\nThis is good for now, but it shows that the revered classloading has some subtle implication as soon as flink dependencies occur both in the user code jar and in `/lib`.

The warning is nice, but without some exclusions from the shading phase, we will have many users wich build gigantic jars (happens to me as well sometimes). Duplicating dependencies into the user jar is more dangerous now than it used to be, given that we have the inverted classloading activated as a default. We saw such issues with Avro, and probably have similar issues with Kryo and custom serializers as well, if they end up both in app classpath and in the user jar.\r\n\r\nI know its harder to maintain, but in this case I think that immediate user experience trumps maintenance effort, so I would vote to add the exclusions back. The exclusions set should be much smaller now that we don't have Hadoop as a dependency here anymore. Having at least the flink projects (and flink-shaded projects) as exclusions, as well as scala / akka / kryo should really help.\r\n\r\nWe can use wildcard exclusions to make it more future safe, like replacing scala version with `*` (`<exclude>org.apache.flink:flink-runtime*</exclude>`) and excluding all artifacts for a group, like `<exclude>org.scala-lang:*</exclude>` and `<exclude>akka:*</exclude>`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/349269771/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/349296371","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/5118#issuecomment-349296371","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/5118","id":349296371,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0OTI5NjM3MQ==","user":{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-05T12:56:41Z","updated_at":"2017-12-05T12:57:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Can't we do what I suggested earlier: don't build a fat jar if you don't specify the `build-jar` profile.
