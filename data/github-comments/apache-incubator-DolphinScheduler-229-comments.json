looking into other modules' start scripts, it seems even config `bin/env/dolphinscheduler_env.sh` will not take effect globally. In each module's start script except that of `worker-server`, it sources the `dolphinscheduler_env.sh` in its own `bin` folder instead of the global `bin/env/dolphinscheduler_env.sh`. Also each module's start script uses its own lib, which means if users use mysql driver, they need to add mysql-connector jar into every module's lib folder. Therefore, there are two problems:\r\n* Why `worker-sever` uses the global `bin/env/dolphinscheduler_env.sh` but others don't? \r\n* Is there any way more convenient for users to config `dolphinscheduler_env.sh` or add extra jar, e.g. mysql-connector jar, into lib folder?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1107881729/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1107894534","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/pull/9733#issuecomment-1107894534","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/9733","id":1107894534,"node_id":"IC_kwDOClTkms5CCSEG","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-24T18:35:01Z","updated_at":"2022-04-27T03:29:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#

In each module's start script except that of `worker-server`, it sources the `dolphinscheduler_env.sh` in its own `bin` folder instead of the global `bin/env/dolphinscheduler_env.sh`. Also each module's start script uses its own lib, which means if users use mysql driver, they need to add mysql-connector jar into every module's lib folder. Therefore, there are two problems:\r\n> \r\n> * Why `worker-sever` uses the global `bin/env/dolphinscheduler_env.sh` but others don't?\r\n> * Is there any way more convenient for users to config `dolphinscheduler_env.sh` or add extra jar, e.g. mysql-connector jar, into lib folder?\r\n\r\nFor ```dolphinscheduler_env.sh```. I think it can be solved in a unified way for the following scenarios.\r\n\r\nFirst of all by adding a variable like ```--envpath``` in each modules ```start.sh```.\r\n\r\n1. For those users who want to use in ```docker``` deployment. Setting the default value of ```--envpath``` to ```source``` each module's own ```dolphinscheduler_env.sh``` when executing ```bash bin/start.sh``` in docker container's starting.\r\n2. For those users who want to use in ```non docker and cluster``` deployment. Then specify ```--envpath  source ${DOLPHINSCHEDULER_HOME}/bin/env/dolphinscheduler_env.sh``` in ```start-all.sh/stop-all.sh/scp-hosts.sh/dolphinscheduler-daemon.sh```.\r\n3. For thos users who want to use in ```user defined``` deployment. Then users can chose using the way of setting ```${DOLPHINSCHEDULER_HOME}/bin/env/dolphinscheduler_env.sh``` or By using ```bin/start.sh -- envpath``` to customize its own path.\r\n\r\nIf we do this. we should also modify the docs.
