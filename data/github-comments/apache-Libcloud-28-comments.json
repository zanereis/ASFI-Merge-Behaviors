The issue was created when a fix for \"AWSRequestSignerAlgorithmV4\" (https://github.com/apache/libcloud/commit/4bff0f076776e6d59945381c1e2969826131fc11) was added. This caused the heads \"host\" and \"accept_encoding\" to be removed from the requests to AzureBlobStorage. The Fix retains the current functionality and sets the headers on for Azure.\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/239078144/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/239078205","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/851#issuecomment-239078205","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/851","id":239078205,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzOTA3ODIwNQ==","user":{"login":"tonybaloney","id":1532417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzI0MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1532417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney","html_url":"https://github.com/tonybaloney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-11T05:44:19Z","updated_at":"2016-08-11T05:44:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"too easy 👍 \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/239078205/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/239078897","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/822#issuecomment-239078897","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/822","id":239078897,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzOTA3ODg5Nw==","user":{"login":"tonybaloney","id":1532417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzI0MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1532417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney","html_url":"https://github.com/tonybaloney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-11T05:50:59Z","updated_at":"2016-08-11T05:50:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm pushing this in unless any serious objections?

The issue was created when a fix for \"AWSRequestSignerAlgorithmV4\" (https://github.com/apache/libcloud/commit/4bff0f076776e6d59945381c1e2969826131fc11) was added. This caused the heads \"host\" and \"accept_encoding\" to be removed from the requests to AzureBlobStorage. The Fix retains the current functionality and sets the headers on for Azure.\nThe copy of the patch that failed is found in: .git/rebase-apply/patch\nWhen you have resolved this problem, run \"git am --continue\".\nIf you prefer to skip this patch, run \"git am --skip\" instead.\nTo restore the original branch and stop patching, run \"git am --abort\".\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/242633304/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/242633637","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/855#issuecomment-242633637","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/855","id":242633637,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MjYzMzYzNw==","user":{"login":"tonybaloney","id":1532417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzI0MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1532417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney","html_url":"https://github.com/tonybaloney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-26T05:26:48Z","updated_at":"2016-08-26T05:26:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"also, convention is that optional parameters that are not defined in the base classes are prepending with `ex_` so I'd ask that the filter was `ex_network_id`.
