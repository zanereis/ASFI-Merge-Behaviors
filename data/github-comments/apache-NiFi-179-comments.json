The existing value of USE_SPECIFIED_OR_FAIL is correct here. When we startup in standalone, not part of a cluster, we want to go ahead and startup, even if the instance is missing one of the extensions referenced in the dataflow. When a user looks at the UI, this is made clear by the fact that the processor is \"Ghosted\" and tooltips, etc. explain exactly what is wrong, and it is easy to address.\r\n\r\nHowever, when a node is part of a cluster, things are a bit more complex. Every node in the cluster is expected to be doing the same thing. This change would result in some nodes in the cluster doing one thing, while other nodes are potentially doing something completely different. For example, if one of 5 nodes is missing an extension, or has an outdated version of the extension, the UI may show that version 1.19 is running. Meanwhile, one node is running version 1.15 of that extension, which behaves differently. This can lead to a great deal of confusion.\r\n\r\nIt is also worth noting that making this change would not really enable zero downtime rolling upgrades. It would remove one of the roadblocks (with significant downside/tradeoffs). However, there are many other things that would have to be considered. Things like cluster protocols between nodes, the load-balancing protocol, site-to-site protocol, etc.\r\n\r\nIn short, there are many parts of the codebase that operate on the assumption that nodes are homogenous (with respect to the nifi version). This change would allow that assertion to no longer hold, which can cause a lot of problems, many of which may be very difficult to understand and troubleshoot.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1287071378/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1287089943","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6562#issuecomment-1287089943","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/6562","id":1287089943,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5Mt28X","user":{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-21T15:04:14Z","updated_at":"2022-10-21T15:04:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @exceptionfactory. I think this does prevent exactly what the Jira describes, and this is good to address. But I don't think it goes far enough, actually. This function actually has the ability to sidestep authorization to the Parameter Context itself. When a user sets a processor's properties, if any property references a parameter, we have an authorization check that the user making the change has read permissions to the parameter context. But consider if a user wanted to sidestep it using a value of:\r\n```\r\n${literal('#'):append('{'):append('myParameter'):append('}'):evaluateELString()}\r\n```\r\nNow, the framework has no way to detect that hey, this is actually referencing a parameter. So it doesn't do any validation checks.

In cases where deployment environments are entirely version controlled, these sorts of issues would seem unlikely to present themselves. Perhaps a flow requires a version of an extension that a new NiFi version doesn't contain, but i would also consider this an error by the operator.\r\n\r\nSince we know NiFi is capable of rolling upgrades, is there an alternative recommended approach?\r\n\r\n[1] [socket site-to-site version negotiation](https://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/main/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-framework-bundle/nifi-framework/nifi-site-to-site/src/main/java/org/apache/nifi/remote/protocol/socket/SocketFlowFileServerProtocol.java#L52)\r\n[2] [http site-to-site version negotiation](https://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/main/nifi-commons/nifi-site-to-site-client/src/main/java/org/apache/nifi/remote/client/http/TransportProtocolVersionNegotiator.java) ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1287187904/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1287250851","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6512#issuecomment-1287250851","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/6512","id":1287250851,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5MueOj","user":{"login":"Lehel44","id":7498857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0OTg4NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7498857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lehel44","html_url":"https://github.com/Lehel44","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lehel44/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lehel44/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lehel44/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lehel44/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lehel44/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lehel44/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lehel44/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lehel44/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lehel44/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-21T17:32:14Z","updated_at":"2022-10-21T17:32:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @turcsanyip @exceptionfactory for the review.

I was merely pointing out that having different logic for standalone and for clustered nodes is very much intentional, not an oversight. The `USE_SPECIFIED_OR_COMPATIBLE_OR_GHOST` strategy is used on startup for standalone nodes. This allows us to automatically upgrade processors from 1.18 to 1.19 when you upgrade, or to startup with a ghosted component if it's not available. But we don't want that behavior when connecting to a cluster. We don't want some nodes ghosting a component while others do not.\r\n\r\nYou do have a good point on the protocol version negotiation for site-to-site and load balancing. But we don't have the same for the cluster protocol, which would be important.\r\n\r\nThe scenario where one node could be missing or has an outdated version of an extension is not necessarily an operator error. This will always be the case when doing a rolling upgrade. Some nodes will be on one version of an extension (say 1.19) while others will be on another version of the extension (say 1.20). The new version may have additional properties, or may be missing certain properties. Or Relationships. But even after the upgrade, there could be a mismatch of versions. And yes, that would likely imply operator error. But just because something is operator error doesn't mean that we should simply let it happen and blame the operator. To the extent that's reasonable, we should prevent operators from doing things that we know are wrong.\r\n\r\nTo be clear here, I'm not saying \"No way, let's not allow for rolling upgrades!\"\r\nWhat I am saying is: \"The current value is there intentionally, it's not a bug. We don't want to just switch it and assume that no problems will arise.
