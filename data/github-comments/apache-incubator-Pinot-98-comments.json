It is a function of   how large your segment is (which includes  number of rows, cardinality of columns, number of columns, length of string columns, the type and number of indices you have in there, etc.). In general, DO NOT use number of rows as the limit. It is better to use segment size as the limit. I hope you are doing that. If so, can you share what the size is, and can you reduce the size?

May not be double (if mmaped), but some extra.\r\n- What happens if segment A takes a long time to complete, and it is a high ingestion use case? Can we stop consumption in A+ after reaching (say) 10% of expected number of rows?

This can be done from the controller. For different partitions, it can provide a slightly increased or decreased number of rows as threshold. The variations may have to be significant for high ingestion use cases, so this will. have to be a function of ingestion rate. This will move us towards a system where at any given time, only some partitions are awaiting completion while others are consuming. Presumably a high ingestion system has several partitions so that we see new rows all the time, and for a low ingestion rate, it may not matter too much.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/885903527/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/885926872","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/7184#issuecomment-885926872","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/7184","id":885926872,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c40zivY","user":{"login":"Jackie-Jiang","id":17555551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTU1NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17555551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang","html_url":"https://github.com/Jackie-Jiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-23T21:38:30Z","updated_at":"2021-07-23T21:38:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@atris The test failure is in star-tree cluster integration test, which is related to the change in this PR.

I think we should look at into coming up with a more generic solution that would work over all Kafka partitions, other streaming solutions (Kenesis for example), and segments that are generated offline as well (a virtual id could be added to each row or segment as the segment is added into Pinot).\r\n\r\nMaintaining a global monotonically increasing counter would be difficult and inefficient to do, but an approximate monotonically increasing counter across all instances should not be that difficult or inefficient and would allow for producing \"good enough\" results for the usecase (internal application polls Pinot at regular intervals to fetch updates) and results could be further fine tuned by doing something like comparing hash of old rows vs new rows while polling the resultset for more results.\r\n\r\nFWIW, I would vote for a holistic solution that is \"good enough\" rather than a \"perfect\" solution that would work only for a single partition Kafka stream.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/886098400/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/886137028","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/7169#issuecomment-886137028","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/7169","id":886137028,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c400WDE","user":{"login":"ramabme","id":84807309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODA3MzA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84807309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramabme","html_url":"https://github.com/ramabme","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramabme/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramabme/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramabme/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramabme/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramabme/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramabme/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramabme/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramabme/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramabme/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-25T02:20:17Z","updated_at":"2021-07-25T02:20:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Cleaned

But Pinot explicitly converts Collection to Object[] ([code snippet](https://github.com/apache/pinot/blob/master/pinot-spi/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/spi/data/readers/BaseRecordExtractor.java#L47)) before calling those json transformations, thus leading to issues like: either no values were extracted with ingestion transformation like `$.commits[*].sha` or throwing PathNotFoundException with sth like `$.commits[0].sha`. \r\n\r\nThe logic to covert Collection to Object[] is necessary, as Object[] is assumed by some transformations, used for MV values on both ingestion and query path.

The inputFilePath that I'm getting passed inside the `SegmentGeneratorConfig`, which is passed to `SegmentIndexCreationDriverImpl` is a path to a local temp directory where the input file has been copied. So the real input path has been lost is that case, which means if the input file path pattern is matching anything other than the file name, it won't work. I see that `SegmentGenerationJobRunner.submitSegmentGenTask()` (in pinot-batch-ingestion-standalone) is where the input file gets copied to the local temp dir, I assume this is so that the input data can be read from a regular Java File vs. needing to use abstract FileSystem stuff everywhere. Wondering if it's worthwhile to at least try to replicate (say for 2-3 levels) the input file hierarchy inside of the temp input dir. Though this same change would need to be made for Hadoop & Spark segment generation code too.\r\n2. I didn't want to hit the `pom.xml` files, but my build was failing without those changes to skip checks on Eclipse-generated files by rat and the apache license checker. I also had to do some dependency management to avoid a build failure due to pinot integration tests pulling in some local cloud test code which used a different version of AWS SDK jars. But I could try to separate those into a different PR.\r\n3. I noticed a few other bits I should clean up when reviewing the committed files (e.g. Javadoc for `InputFileSegmentNameGenerator`, cleaning up use of `@Nullable` in arguments). I've made those changes in my branch, just haven't pushed yet to update the PR.\r\n\r\nAnyway, looking for input on items 1 & 2 above.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/888686908/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/888690584","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/7224#issuecomment-888690584","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/7224","id":888690584,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c40-FeY","user":{"login":"klsince","id":61892277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxODkyMjc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61892277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/klsince","html_url":"https://github.com/klsince","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klsince/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klsince/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klsince/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klsince/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klsince/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klsince/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klsince/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klsince/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klsince/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-28T23:41:51Z","updated_at":"2021-07-28T23:41:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Came into this issue while using jsonPathArray() during ingestion to extract the `id` field from `labels` JSONArray into a Pinot MV column. The output array from jsonPathArray() has [Int, Int, Long, Int] and led to error saying 'Long can't be cast to Integer' in this [method](https://github.com/apache/pinot/blob/master/pinot-common/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/common/utils/PinotDataType.java#L246). Casting to `Number` to convert types for those numeric PinotDataType would fix this issue. \r\n\r\n```\r\n      \"labels\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"id\": 100632567,\r\n...\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"id\": 100632569,\r\n...\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"id\": 2910737149,\r\n...\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"id\": 1260414978,\r\n     ...\r\n        }\r\n      ],\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this fix can't handle more complex cases, like numbers, strings, list, maps are mixed in output array from jsonPathArray(). The [complexType](https://docs.pinot.apache.org/basics/data-import/complex-type) might help in those cases.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/888690584/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/888708262","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/7222#issuecomment-888708262","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/7222","id":888708262,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c40-Jym","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-29T00:29:50Z","updated_at":"2021-08-20T04:30:39Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/7222?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) Report\n> Merging [#7222](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/7222?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (37e98be) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/commit/f3ce66fe4781205ee74b99529918888347575f04?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (f3ce66f) will **decrease** coverage by `2.17%`.\n> The diff coverage is `86.95%`.\n\n> :exclamation: Current head 37e98be differs from pull request most recent head 649b0d8.
