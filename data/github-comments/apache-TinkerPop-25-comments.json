It just seems that this PR is a \"this would be cool\" and implemented. Not: \"So, primitives all fit this style of manipulation in a flow-based system...\"\r\n\r\nQuestions that arise:\r\n\r\n* What about `unfold()`? Now we are in character manipulation or just single character strings?\r\n* What about `fold()`? Does character folding become strings?\r\n* What about `range()` on doubles/floats? Is that a way to clip precision?\r\n\r\nI don't think we should just add this PR without a fully thought through model for all primitives and how they will be effected by the current or \"need to be built\" steps.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/282323112/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/282324621","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/564#issuecomment-282324621","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/564","id":282324621,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MjMyNDYyMQ==","user":{"login":"okram","id":148925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODkyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/148925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram","html_url":"https://github.com/okram","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-24T15:48:17Z","updated_at":"2017-02-24T15:48:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Also, what other string operations do we need?

Thanks for doing that. \r\n\r\nI've given this a quick review and have a few top-level comments:\r\n\r\n* Note that our code style is to explicitly use `final` for all variable declarations that require it - i think we make exceptions on exceptions in catch blocks and the var declaration of a `for()` loop, but that's about it. I think you've missed a few of those.\r\n* Could you please rename `BasicGraphManager` to `DefaultGraphManager`? We only use the term \"Basic\" in one other class naming, so it's a bit of an anomaly compared to \"Default\".\r\n* Does this change introduce any compile-time breaking changes for anyone who has depended on the  `GraphManager` class (or other things you've modified)? I'm wondering if this is a change better suited for the master branch and 3.3.0. If it stays on `tp32` I may have to ask you to provide a second pull request to master that can also be evaluated as part of a second review/vote.\r\n* The addition of `addGraph()` is nice.\r\n* Can you elaborate on the usage of `openGraph()` - I think I get it, but it's not clear to me based on the javadoc/default implementation\r\n* Please add a entry (or more) to CHANGELOG for these updates.\r\n* Please update the reference documentation to include your new Gremlin Server configuration option here: http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/reference/#_configuring_2 - not sure how much you need to write here. Users of `GraphManager` have likely dug pretty deep into the code and will see how it works. Perhaps include a link to the javadoc for `GraphManager` and beef up the class javadoc there so that implementers know what to do.\r\n\r\nJust a bit of warning - from my perspective, this is a fairly involved pull request you've started (and thanks!) so it will likely take a some time and iterations to get through before we can get it merged.  \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/285653186/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/285699513","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/569#issuecomment-285699513","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/569","id":285699513,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NTY5OTUxMw==","user":{"login":"dpitera","id":13453236,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDUzMjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13453236?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpitera","html_url":"https://github.com/dpitera","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpitera/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpitera/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpitera/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpitera/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpitera/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpitera/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpitera/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpitera/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpitera/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-10T15:33:56Z","updated_at":"2017-03-10T15:33:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Does this change introduce any compile-time breaking changes for anyone who has depended on the GraphManager class (or other things you've modified)?\r\n\r\nI believe the answer is no (in the non-mutated use of pure tinkerpop) because:\r\n\r\n1. The previous implementation's graphManager instantiation could only be retrieved by two places:\r\n  1. The [ServerGremlinExecutor](https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/ad51fb24eb4d621763f6b3c02029daa54e7dc20d/gremlin-server/src/main/java/org/apache/tinkerpop/gremlin/server/util/ServerGremlinExecutor.java#L202) which is only accessible through the [GremlinServer](https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/c5b9680e70d696d000b945abbd72a3b8a3f97256/gremlin-server/src/main/java/org/apache/tinkerpop/gremlin/server/GremlinServer.java#L328) which users do not have access to the instantiation unless they have modified their implementor's logic to define its own \"GremlinServer\" and not use Tinkerpop's\r\n  2. The [Context](https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/4293eb333dfbf3aea19cd326f9f3d13619ac0b54/gremlin-server/src/main/java/org/apache/tinkerpop/gremlin/server/Context.java#L80) which also is instantiated by the same graphManager pulled from the servergremlinexecutor, and the Context class is final (and thus cannot be extended) and there is no way to retrieve that `Context` in the code.\r\n\r\nTherefore, i am not sure who would have been able to make use of the graphManager themselves without using a modified version of tinkerpop.\r\n\r\n> Can you elaborate on the usage of openGraph()\r\n\r\nThe `addGraph()` and `getGraph()` are to act as modifiers to the object holding the graph references, while `opengraph()` allows for a mechanism by which to instantiate a graph dynamically through the graphManager (and thus allow for reference tracking of it) that is not currently in said graphManager's reference tracking object. The use of a `Supplier` here allows for the implementor to define his/her own custom function by which to instantiate the graph\r\n\r\n>  If it stays on tp32 I may have to ask you to provide a second pull request to master that can also be evaluated as part of a second review/vote.\r\n\r\nI would say once we get this one merged, then we can open the PR on master, but I would like to get it into the next release as well\r\n\r\n> it will likely take a some time and iterations to get through before we can get it merged\r\n\r\nSounds good. I usually prefer quality to expediency. When I get around to fixing up some of your requests, I will leave a comment here saying I have pushed new code.\r\n\r\nThanks for your review.

Normally we wouldn't allow such a change on `tp32` because it does immediately make people's code not compile if they used that class in that way but this class is fairly internal. If someone is using it they likely know what they are doing. @dpitera I tend to agree that this is outside the scope of what would need to remain compatible. That said, I think you will have to add an entry to the upgrade docs (i guess the user section???) about this breaking change and just mention how they go about fixing it (i.e. use the `DefaultGraphManager`). We'll probably also want to send a quick email to the dev list to just alert everyone to a break to make sure no one is buggin' about that.

it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/285709509/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/286483513","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/570#issuecomment-286483513","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/570","id":286483513,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NjQ4MzUxMw==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-14T16:45:21Z","updated_at":"2017-03-14T16:45:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Changes
