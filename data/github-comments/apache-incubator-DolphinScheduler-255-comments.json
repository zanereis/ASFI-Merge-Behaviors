It looks like `bitnami repo` has updated `postgresql` and `zookeeper` versions. And they don't contains the low version. \r\n\r\nI think is a huge problem. When DS release a new version, the `postgresql` and `zookeeper` version will be specified and not changed anymore. And the people who want to deploy on K8s will occur this problem.\r\n\r\n- Question two is still on 300b1 and I'm not sure is fixed by the dev or not. I'll check later.
