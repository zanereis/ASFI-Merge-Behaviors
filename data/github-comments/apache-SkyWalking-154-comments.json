could be many reasons. Two kinds of them\r\n1. SkyWalking doesn't make sure the data always there in the storage. Due to your performance limits of OAP and storage cluster deployments, no one can guarantee that. The 1st priority of SkyWalking is keeping your business application safe in memory and network perspective. So, the agent will abandon some traces if your backend(OAP or storage) is not powerful enough. You should be able to see abandon logs in the agents.\r\n1. There are some plugins have bugs, the trace/span are generated, but not finish as expected.
