As a result, the type of `innerExpression` field is String whose value is `(order_id)`, which should be parsed as `ColumnSegment` object.\r\n- the field text of `ExpressionProjectionSegment` is a Stirng type, which cannot be converted to a AST expression, for example, in the select list of this sql text `select 10 + 30, order_id + 10, order_id, user_id from t_order`, the expression of `10+30`  will be parsed as an `ExpressionProjectionSegment` object.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/864961831/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/864976572","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/pull/10889#issuecomment-864976572","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/10889","id":864976572,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2NDk3NjU3Mg==","user":{"login":"guimingyue","id":1716196,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MTYxOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1716196?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guimingyue","html_url":"https://github.com/guimingyue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guimingyue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guimingyue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guimingyue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guimingyue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guimingyue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guimingyue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guimingyue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guimingyue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guimingyue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-21T12:01:37Z","updated_at":"2021-06-21T12:01:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Hi @guimingyue ,\r\n> \r\n> That's exactly for our first step.

This PR looks fine with me, and we can consider the following two points for the next PR,\r\n> \r\n> 1. Remove the stale `StandardMetaDataContexts ` constructor\r\n> 2. Add a tableName field in `TableMetaData` wo avoid `Map<Map<String, TableMetaData>, Map<String, TableMetaData>> build()`\r\n> \r\n> Also, @Beyondeclipse, do you think this PR has room to improve in #10911? Could you give more explanation?\r\n> \r\n> @terrymanu , could you have a look at `ShardingSphereRulesBuilder.java` of this PR, since I saw it involves your `todo` comment?\r\n\r\nOK, thank you.
