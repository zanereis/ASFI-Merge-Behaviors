That can be changed, much like master in git can be changed.\r\nAncestors can't be changed.\"\r\n\r\nThe current main can change when rollback is performed. The snapshot which gets resolved for a given time T should remain constant regardless of what is the current main ancestor lineage. History entries capture all the changes on the main table state and are what enable this ability to time travel to a snapshot which are outside the current table ancestors which is ultimately desired behavior. It also doesn't make sense to treat main as a separate case, and have a different semantic for non-main branches when it comes to time travel. \r\n\r\nMaybe we could maintain separate history metadata for branches, but most likely it would need to be opt-in by users for specific branches and would need to not add too much metadata to manage.\r\n\r\nSo for now, it makes sense just to do time travel to a branch tip or time travel to a given tag.

Do we want to handle a situation where a single FsspecFileIO instance is handling locations of varying schemes?\r\n2. In order to use the `Dict[str, str]` type that's been added to the parent FileIO interface, I've set a `client_` prefix for client kwargs and `fs_` prefix for filesystem kwargs. They're then plucked out in the `_fs_properties()` and `_client_properties()` methods. Should this be where we also look for the java property keys and plug them in?
