thanks for the advice.\r\n\r\nSorry, but trying to work out one final thing. In ```TopicsImpl.java```, the Web Target I think refers to the REST endpoint (```PersistentTopicsBase```), but what I found strange was that I thought it cycled back on itself. So when I looked at the files, PersistentTopicsBase#createSubscription called TopicsImpl#createSubscriptionAsync whose web target seemed to link back to PersistentTopicsBase#createSubscription.

`MaxMessageSize` should be agreed between client, broker and bookie. So a better approach would be:\r\n> \r\n> 1. adding a setting `MaxMessageSize` setting to broker configuration.\r\n> 2. introduce a mechanism between client and broker to fetch some broker configurations when the client establishes a connection to broker. in this case, broker can return the MaxMessageSize it supports. so the client knows exactly the MaxMessageSize setting which it can use.\r\n> \r\n> in any case, since we are changing a default value that is impacting end-users directly, a PIP is required.\r\n\r\nI simply think client and broker use PulsarDecoder.MaxFrameSize or PulsarDecoder.MaxMessageSize  config，like:\r\n```java\r\n[client]\r\nif (payloadSize > PulsarDecoder.MaxMessageSize) \r\nif (compressedSize > PulsarDecoder.MaxMessageSize) \r\n[broker]\r\nnew

adding another support for ```MessageBuilder<O> process(I input, Context context);``` will likely involve adding another function interface that users can implement and adding support for it in the functions framework .  This will be a bigger change and perhaps require broader discussion.  \r\n\r\nI am not sure adding another function interface is the correct way to go about this.  My concerns about this:\r\n\r\n1. User's will have to implement another interface to take advantage of being able to set these message confs for returned output.  If a user has already written a function using our current function interface, he or she will have to change it.  This forces users to make a considerable amount of changes instead of just calling an additional method.\r\n\r\n2. Additional interface we will have to support in the function runtime.  While this is not a deal breaker for me, but I rather not support any more interfaces than necessary.  In my opinion, only when we absolutely cannot use the existing function interface to accomplish something should we consider this because this can additional complexity to the function runtime.\r\n\r\n3. My vision for functions is that we keep a certain distance from a producer and consumer API to distinguish functions a way to do lightweight compute and not just some generic consume/produce application.  So I would rather not have any more APIs that resemble consumer/producer semantics.  Again this is just a preference.\r\n\r\n> It is very error-prone. If people didn’t pay attention or then implementation doesn’t handle correctly, the message conf is going to apply to every message\r\n\r\nI understand your concern for this\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nif (foo) {\r\nmessageBuilder.setKey(foo)\r\n}\r\n\r\nif (bar) {\r\nmessageBuilder.setProperties(bar)\r\n}\r\n\r\nmesageBuilder.setValue(val)\r\n\r\nreturn messageBuilder;\r\n```\r\n\r\nis that really less error prone than:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (foo) {\r\nmessageBuilderConf.setKey(foo)\r\n}\r\n\r\nif (bar) {\r\nmessageBuilderConf.setProperties(bar)\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontext.setOutputMessageConf(messageBuilderConf);\r\n\r\nreturn val;\r\n```\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/485191485/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/485203073","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/3217#issuecomment-485203073","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/3217","id":485203073,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NTIwMzA3Mw==","user":{"login":"ConcurrencyPractitioner","id":25971966,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTcxOTY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25971966?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConcurrencyPractitioner","html_url":"https://github.com/ConcurrencyPractitioner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConcurrencyPractitioner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConcurrencyPractitioner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConcurrencyPractitioner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConcurrencyPractitioner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConcurrencyPractitioner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConcurrencyPractitioner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConcurrencyPractitioner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConcurrencyPractitioner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConcurrencyPractitioner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-21T00:13:39Z","updated_at":"2019-04-21T00:13:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Oh sorry, found the answer.

Hence the function implementor should not change any kind of state of context. At the time that you introduce `context.setOutputMessageConf(messageBuilderConf)`, you are turning context from immutable to mutable. The problem arises, because the context is shared by all the context.publish calls. Hence you have to take care of the sequence `setOutputMessageConf` and calling `context.publish`, if you don't take care of the sequence, race conditions can arise and unpredictability also arise. A lot of unknown bugs will be introduced. And that's what I called error prone.\r\n\r\nIn the approach I proposed, context.newOutputMessageBuilder() returns a brand new builder for each calls. The function implementation can attach different properties to different builders and they are isolated. you don't need to worry about the sequence of setting properties between two publish calls.\r\n\r\nJust think about the following implementation. \r\n\r\n```\r\nMessageBuilder<T> msgBuilder1 = context.newOutputMessage(\"topic\");\r\nmsgBuilder1.key(\"key1\");\r\nMessageBuilder<T> msgBuilder2 = context.newOutputMessage(\"topic\");\r\nmsgBuilder2.key(\"key2\");\r\nMessageBuilder<T> msgBuilder3 = context.newOutputMessage(\"topic\");\r\n\r\nmsgBuilder3.value(\"value3\");\r\nmsgBuilder2.value(\"value2\");\r\nmsgBuilder1.value(“value1\");\r\n\r\nmsgBuilder1.sendAsync();\r\nmsgBuilder2.sendAsync();\r\nmsgBuilder3.sendAsync();\r\n```\r\n\r\n> adding another support for MessageBuilder<O> process(I input, Context context); will likely involve adding another function interface that users can implement and adding support for it in the functions framework . This will be a bigger change and perhaps require broader discussion.\r\n\r\n\r\n@jerrypeng I am not proposing adding a new interface. it is still the same function interface. but the generic type of the function is `MessageBuilder<T>`. \r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class MessageBuilderFunction<I, O> implements Function<I, TypedMessageBuilder<O>> {\r\n    @Override\r\n    public TypedMessageBuilder<O> process(I input, Context context) throws Exception {\r\n\r\n        TypedMessageBuilder<O> msgBuilder = context.newOutputMessage();\r\n        \r\n        msgBuilder.value(process(input));\r\n        msgBuilder.key(...);\r\n\r\n        return msgBuilder;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n The only change is in PulsarSink#write(Record<T> record), check if `record.getValue` is a TypedMessageBuilder, if so use the builder. It is a simple and straightforward change without changing any interfaces.\r\n\r\nRegarding your concerns about my proposal, I believe it comes from your misunderstanding on my proposal. but anyway I am replying one by one as below.\r\n\r\n> User's will have to implement another interface to take advantage of being able to set these message confs for returned output. If a user has already written a function using our current function interface, he or she will have to change it. This forces users to make a considerable amount of changes instead of just calling an additional method.\r\n\r\nIf users already have functions, they probably don't need to attach properties to the output message. If users really want to change old functions to attach propertites, what he needs to do is change the generic type from `O` to `TypedMessageBuilder<O>`, and change `return O;` to `return context.newOutputMessage().value(O);`. I don't see how this can be a considerable amount changes than calling additional method.\r\n\r\n> Additional interface we will have to support in the function runtime. While this is not a deal breaker for me, but I rather not support any more interfaces than necessary.\r\n\r\nThis is not a new interface. As I described above, this only requires a few lines change in PulsarSink. I don't see why this is a breaker.\r\n\r\n> My vision for functions is that we keep a certain distance from a producer and consumer API to distinguish functions a way to do lightweight compute and not just some generic consume/produce application. So I would rather not have any more APIs that resemble consumer/producer semantics. \r\n\r\nwhy it is called lightweight computing? It is because users don't have to worry about error handling, exactly-once, code distribution, failover and many things that they have to worry about using a pure producer or consumer. but it doesn't mean they shouldn't use the well-defined pulsar api around message builder. \r\n\r\nPulsar functions is part of Pulsar. we should use whatever is already defined as an API in pulsar, rather than spinning off any kind of new interfaces.\r\n\r\nHence I don't see how `newOutputMessage()` would introduce any complexity into functions. It is actually much simpler, more flexible and easier to maintain than current messy `context.publish` interfaces.\r\n\r\n ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/485254074/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/485254524","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/4046#issuecomment-485254524","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/4046","id":485254524,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NTI1NDUyNA==","user":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-21T14:06:56Z","updated_at":"2019-04-21T14:06:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"run java8 tests","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/485254524/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/485254585","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/1964#issuecomment-485254585","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/1964","id":485254585,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NTI1NDU4NQ==","user":{"login":"sekarpdkt","id":2845842,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NDU4NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2845842?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekarpdkt","html_url":"https://github.com/sekarpdkt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekarpdkt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekarpdkt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekarpdkt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekarpdkt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekarpdkt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekarpdkt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekarpdkt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekarpdkt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekarpdkt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-21T14:07:43Z","updated_at":"2019-04-21T14:07:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I tried it in Ubuntu.
