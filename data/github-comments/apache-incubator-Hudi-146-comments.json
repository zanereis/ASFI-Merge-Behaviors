Hi,When I test Spark3, I find that Spark SQL for Hoodie with Spark3 uses the source code of Spark, but columns aliases in Merge Into is not supported in Spark3, it will throw the following exception: 'Columns aliases are not allowed in MERGE.'.I think there are two solutions, one is to modify the source code of Spark3 to make Spark support, the other is to write code in hudi-spark3 to implement Spark SQL for Hoodie, but I personally feel that this is a big change, I do not know if I understand correctly.

At this point, we are still seeing several test failures when enabling metadata https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/3411/, and some of them are actual bugs. So, we have taken a call to stabilize this after Hudi 0.9.0, potentially in another minor release 0.9.1.\r\n\r\nFor other defaults, I think @nsivabalan has separate PRs put out to enable some of them.

And also you can run the test case in spark3 by the follow command:\r\n> > > mvn clean install -DskipTests -Pspark3\r\n> > > mvn test -Punit-tests -Pspark3 -pl hudi-spark-datasource/hudi-spark\r\n> \r\n> Hi, @pengzhiwei2018 The result is:'Tests: succeeded 56, failed 6, canceled 0, ignored 0, pending 0'.Two of them are ORC exceptions, and the other three I think are due to time zone differences, but I don't know how to solve the time zone difference, and the other one is the mismatch of exception information. The detailed results are as follows:\r\n> \r\n> `1、Test Different Type of Partition Column *** FAILED *** Expected Array([1,a1,10,2021-05-20 00:00:00], [2,a2,10,2021-05-20 00:00:00]), but got Array([1,a1,10.0,2021-05-20 15:00:00], [2,a2,10.0,2021-05-20 15:00:00]) 2、- Test MergeInto Exception *** FAILED *** Expected \"... for target field: '[id]' in merge into upda...\", but got \"... for target field: '[_ts]' in merge into upda...\" (TestHoodieSqlBase.scala:86) 3、test basic HoodieSparkSqlWriter functionality with datasource insert for COPY_ON_WRITE with ORC as the base file format with populate meta fields true *** FAILED *** 4、test basic HoodieSparkSqlWriter functionality with datasource insert for MERGE_ON_READ with ORC as the base file format with populate meta fields true *** FAILED *** 5、Test Sql Statements *** FAILED *** java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: UnExpect result for: select id, name, price, cast(dt as string) from h0_p Expect: 1 a1 10 2021-05-07 00:00:00, Actual: 1 a1 10 2021-05-07 15:00:00 6、Test Create Table As Select *** FAILED *** Expected Array([1,a1,10,2021-05-06 00:00:00]), but got Array([1,a1,10,2021-05-06 15:00:00]) (TestHoodieSqlBase.scala:78) `\r\n\r\nI have rebased the code to the master and test for spark3.
