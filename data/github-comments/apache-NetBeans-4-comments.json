Here is what currently happens:\r\n\r\n1. `j2ee.persistence-external-resources.zip` is downloaded into the external directory\r\n2. the `build.xml` of the module declares a `build-init` task, that unzips the files into the folder `./src/org/netbeans/modules/j2ee/persistence/dd/resources/`\r\n3. From that directory these files are included into the final archive\r\n\r\nSo what I would do:\r\n\r\n- remove the XSDs from the projects `.gitignore` file\r\n- expand the contents of the zip as the `build.xml` does (make sure the XSD are in the correct location)\r\n- add the source files directly to the repository\r\n- remove the whole `external` folder\r\n- remove the `build-init` task from

I  checked out your PR and did a short test.  The purpose was to see how this changes for the default IDE user using default settings:\r\n\r\nWith your PR  (and with default settings) the following snippet:\r\n```java\r\npublic static void example() {\r\n    if (x == y) try {\r\n        System.out.println();\r\n    } catch (Throwable t) {\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nwill now be left intact, whereas previously it would be reformatted into (braces added):\r\n```java\r\npublic static void example() {\r\n    if (x == y) {\r\n        try {\r\n            System.out.println();\r\n        } catch (Throwable t) {\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nExactly as you claim. Check!\r\n\r\nI also did a small regression test. The following code snippet\r\n\r\n```java\r\nif (x == y) \r\n    System.out.println();\r\n```\r\nwill be reformatted into\r\n\r\n```java\r\nif (x == y) {\r\n    System.out.println();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nboth with and without the PR. Check !\r\n\r\nPersonally I find this change in default behavior to be acceptable even if the ideal situation would be that your proposal would be 100% opt-in based.  Let's see what other say. I'm imagining that your proposal would be more acceptable if you could make it completely without side-effects for existing users. Then it would be more or less impossible to argue against. But again, it is ok for me personally.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/338463594/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/338464100","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/171#issuecomment-338464100","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/171","id":338464100,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzODQ2NDEwMA==","user":{"login":"geertjanw","id":5309985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMDk5ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5309985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw","html_url":"https://github.com/geertjanw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-22T09:33:29Z","updated_at":"2017-10-22T09:33:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Yes, by hand. :-) If someone has a way to automate this, great;
