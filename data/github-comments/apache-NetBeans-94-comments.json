Flaky tests are a major PITA. \r\n\r\nRight, I encourage everyone to add `@RandomlyFailing` to any test that is randomly failing.

Such a flaky tests should be executed only by \"Java editor\" guys, not everyone. We don't want to fix buggy Java editor code, we only want to know whether we cause regressions there by our own changes. Adding `@RandomlyFailing` annotation gets us into such state incrementally. The other option is to exclude the whole module from CI testing - I'd  rather delay such decision and rather start using `@RandomlyFailing` aggresisvelly.\r\n\r\n> So if noone steps up to fix a test, I think shooting it down is a valid option. Just my 2cents.\r\n\r\nRight. However this case isn't an example of randomly failing test. The test works reliably on JDK-8 and nobody bothered to execute it on JDK-11 yet. It is failing reliably on JDK-11 because of a bug in the platform. It should be fixed, not shoot down. We should have a CI executing the test on JDK-11 too.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/961616238/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/961806020","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/3206#issuecomment-961806020","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/3206","id":961806020,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M45U_7E","user":{"login":"JaroslavTulach","id":26887752,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODg3NzUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26887752?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach","html_url":"https://github.com/JaroslavTulach","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-05T11:08:28Z","updated_at":"2021-11-05T11:09:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> This problem shall be fixed automatically as soon as this PR is merged. \r\n> Then `java.source.nbjavac` disappears from the _NetBeans Distribution_ update center.\r\n\r\nI've just built new, fresh version from 92c782a8e3bb22, made sure there is no\r\n```bash\r\nnetbeans$ find nbbuild/ | grep java.source.nbjavac\r\n```\r\nand then `ant tryme`.

It matches my results too using other JMH benchmarks I wrote once. (I usually have \"time\" set to 5s instead of 500ms to give the JIT a bit more iterations)\r\n\r\na few remarks:\r\n - JDK 7 won't play a role for NetBeans since the language level is set to 8, but its still interesting to have the numbers\r\n - I don't think javac will play a role in this particular case, since it should produce same bytecode for all language levels [1]\r\n   - the differences are due to improvements to fast paths in the JDK and JIT\r\n   - so it basically depends on what JDK NB is running on, not how it was built (in this particular case)\r\n - ~~the regression on 11 is interesting, my guess is that it has to do with extra logic of compact strings, which is a 9+ feature and took probably a while to get fully optimized~~\r\n - its always nice to see how significant the improvement is, caused by a simple JDK upgrade.\r\n   - e.g due to: https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/pull/71\r\n\r\nMy take on this: Since indexof is not dependent on the javac language level, lets optimize for latest JDK versions. The difference is very small but the code difference is tiny too. If 'c' compared to \"c\" is a little bit faster, its hard to find reasons to not use it. \r\n\r\nEven if the performance is going to be equal one day (as it is with replace, append etc), it wouldn't cause a regression either - not in code style or performance.\r\n\r\n [1] javac is translating it to standard `invokevirtual` `java/lang/String.indexOf:(Ljava/lang/String;)I` or `java/lang/String.indexOf:(I)I` with no additional invokedynamic magic applied like it would for string concatenations. \r\n\r\nYou can check this with `javap -c -v /path/to/Foo.class` (it helps using small classes as input to keep the output smaller)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/966959808/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/966964615","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/3296#issuecomment-966964615","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/3296","id":966964615,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M45orWH","user":{"login":"sdedic","id":26788611,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg4NjEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26788611?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic","html_url":"https://github.com/sdedic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-12T09:46:55Z","updated_at":"2021-11-12T09:46:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Sigh.
