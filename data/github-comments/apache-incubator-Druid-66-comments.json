I am not familiar with Avro, some of my considerations (may not right, please point out) :\n1. Druid support limited dimensions with String and list of String, so nested structure is not needed. This make the implementation simple enough;\n2. Avro need a Schema File to generate object. If dynamic schema is supported, there is still a problem that data types may mismatch with parquet files. From this perspective, a strict matched schema file must be provided.

What you end up with is a GenericRecord object with the data for a row, without writing several converter classes.\n\nFor nested data, parquet-avro support doesn't impose a nested structure, but it can handle nesting if that's what the file contains. Parquet supports nesting just like Avro so it's better to have an object model that can deal with it, even if you ignore the map and array columns.\n\nI think using a pre-built object model will be the simplest way forward.

main reason that we have to use `mvn install` to get the tarball is because we've changed the layout of extension files in the tarball, in order to get extensions files we have to call `pull-deps` in the end of the build, which requires extension jars installed in the local repository.\n\nThe pain point comes from the fact that releasing RCs becomes very convoluted. In order to get the tarball, you have to manually change pom tags and then do `mvn install`.\n\nA simple hack is let `mvn package` install the jars in the local repository so that we can get the tarball by `mvn package`,\n\n```\ndiff --git a/pom.xml b/pom.xml\nindex cacd1aa..2b3273e 100644\n--- a/pom.xml\n+++ b/pom.xml\n@@ -650,6 +650,14 @@\n

I can weigh in a bit here, performance is always paramount and multiple ways to do the same thing is not necessarily a problem as long as there is a \"preferred\" way and we are just maintaining one of them for legacy reasons.\n\nOn the topic of this change in particular.  I like the general idea of it.  It seems to be trying to simplify the various logic and making it easier to actually do the queries.  I think a lot of it is likely working around the annoyance of how difficult it is to actually register new filter objects.\n\nIt can make it a little more difficult if we implement `!=` and other things this way to do optimizations.  Should we expect the \"not\" filter or should we expect a selector with a `!=`.\n\nIf I can redirect the effort a little bit, I think this might be really nice if accompanied by a \"new\" filter that essentially implements a \"WHERE\" clause.  There could be a part of the query pipeline added that essentially rewrites the \"WHERE\" clause into a set of the \"primitive\" filters that we have today.  If we had that, then we could hide the \"selector\" filter behind said rewriting.  We could tell users to use that method for their filters and behind the scenes, we can generate whatever ends up being the most performant.\n\nHow does that

please Let me explain more what's my point:\n1 - This PR is introducing operators like `<`or`>` and doesn't cover all the aspect of it and bound filter does so i don't see how we can have two filters together.\n2 -  While it is true from a human perspective it is cool to have one filter that does everything using math like operators, but i think druid API is designed to be automatically generated. So having Filters in the form of POJOs structure is better IMO than having a filter that uses special characters like `!=`. \n 3 - IMO i don't think it is the way to go to have multiple API doing the same thing, if there is no reason to change the API i don't see why we changed.\n\nSo know you may ignore 2 and 3, but i don't think 1 can be ignored. If so please explain how this can be ignored or fixed.\nThanks!     \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/186236287/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/186251893","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/2419#issuecomment-186251893","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2419","id":186251893,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4NjI1MTg5Mw==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-19T15:08:00Z","updated_at":"2016-02-19T15:08:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"travis said `BUILD SUCCESS` but marked it failed (https://travis-ci.org/druid-io/druid/builds/110276622)?
