blackdrag,\n\nthat's what i thought about as well.\n\nIn fact one reason for me is, that in GroovyMain the given \"script\" String has to be an existing file if it is a scriptfile. In the ClassLoader it is possible to write pathes in the classpath which doesn't actually exist, but could exist later. That's why we can use file.exists() in GroovyMain, while this check isn't working for any cases in the ClassLoader.\n\nAnother reason is, that the defined URI pattern is completely RFC conform and it just fails in Cygwin environments if the given script is created with a false cygpath call. This problem is catched by using the file instead of the URI. But if we got a correct URI in GroovyMain (the only way to determine if it's correct, if we ignore this exception driven development I had to implement in the ClassLoader, is to use the pattern) we should use this URI as is.\n\nI'm not sure which way is the better one. My solution in the GroovyClassloader should also work in GroovyMain, but if we would use it, we couldn't remove the URI pattern because it is already used in `public String getText(String uriOrFilename)` as well.\n\nGreets,\nMarcus\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/117498140/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/118081364","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/43#issuecomment-118081364","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/43","id":118081364,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExODA4MTM2NA==","user":{"login":"PascalSchumacher","id":2707245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDcyNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2707245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher","html_url":"https://github.com/PascalSchumacher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-02T16:13:51Z","updated_at":"2015-07-02T16:13:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@blackdrag
