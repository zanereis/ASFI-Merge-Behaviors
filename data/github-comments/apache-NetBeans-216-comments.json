This is something what is done once (if at all) and then no longer really relevant during dev time. Highlighting is a generic font/colors attribute. Sometimes showing less is better :) (I also do agree with @matthiasblaesing, the coloring setting should probably not even exist since it should be under fonts/colors - but this is not your fault, the UI was already there)\r\n\r\nNow, if we agree that we don't care about coloring options, all what is left is the order-by combo box. And since it has only two items, it is a checkbox in disguise, which would fit pretty well right next to the other check boxes on the main dialog ;). But if you implemented the link to the options already - thats also fine with me.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a problem though: duplicated code.
