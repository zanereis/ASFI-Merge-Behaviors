Thanks for the comments here, they are quite helpful in understanding the motivations. \n\nI think of \"users\" of Kafka Streams mainly in two categories: 1) application developers who are only interested in the computational logics, who would not be interested in learning Kafka specs like partition assignment and task migration, state management / serdes, stream-time extraction, etc; for example, \"as a data scientist I should not need to worry which partition this record is going to while coding my stream analytics application\". 2) framework developers, who can then extend the interfaces like StateStore, TimestampExtractor, PartitionGrouper, Partitioner, Seriailizer etc. When I talked about \"confusing users\" I meant this KStreamPartitioner will be exposed to the first categories of users who would then be forced to learn how to specify the partitioning for Kafka, what are the other uses of this topic in the Kafka cluster, etc, while it would be great if we could expose it only to the second group of users, who would then design those functions and wrap them as config values for the first group of users to apply. And by reducing the control of partitioners only to a small group of users the likelihood of conflicting partitioning schemes for shared topics would also be reduced (as I meant for \"less vulnerable\").\n\nThat said, if moving forward we realize there is no clear boundary between these two groups of users and people treat it as less burden to be exposed to some low-level details in their APIs we can consider adding them back.

As discussed, I tried to attack this from both sides of the deadlock. I refactored Partition to not hold the leaderIsrUpdateLock when completed the delayed requests, and I refactored GroupMetadataManager to divide storage into two calls so that we didn't need to hold the group metadata lock when doing the actual append.  Both solutions are... a little ugly.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/156266609/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/156273493","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/518#issuecomment-156273493","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/518","id":156273493,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NjI3MzQ5Mw==","user":{"login":"benstopford","id":1297498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTc0OTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1297498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benstopford","html_url":"https://github.com/benstopford","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benstopford/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benstopford/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benstopford/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benstopford/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benstopford/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benstopford/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benstopford/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benstopford/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benstopford/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-12T23:48:47Z","updated_at":"2015-11-12T23:48:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I can't really comment on the Python but the logic looks good to me. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/156273493/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/156281851","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/520#issuecomment-156281851","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/520","id":156281851,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NjI4MTg1MQ==","user":{"login":"gwenshap","id":1189030,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODkwMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1189030?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap","html_url":"https://github.com/gwenshap","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-13T00:42:11Z","updated_at":"2015-11-13T00:42:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yeah, looks like the main problem is that MiniKDC generates its own KRB5 file and doesn't take any inputs regarding what to put there.\n\nSince MiniKDC is a single file, perhaps we can just fork it into our tools package and modify the part that generates KRB5? Maybe fix the annoying bug in the log (hostname:hostname rather than host:port...) while we are at it.
