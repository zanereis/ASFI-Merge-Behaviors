higher\r\n`runc` no more use default(`/run/runc`) directory as a root directory.\r\nIt uses `/run/docker/runtime-runc/moby`.\r\n\r\n### Docker 18.06 -> 18.09\r\nThe name of `runc` is changed from `docker-runc` to `runc`.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMHO, there are few options to have multiple versions of docker, but I think it would be easier to configure the version at the deployment time.\r\n\r\nFor example, we can have both versions of docker binaries in the invoker as @markusthoemmes suggested.\r\nIt will have two binaries, `docker-runc` and just `runc`.\r\nBased on the configuration, `DockerClient(RuncClient)` will selectively look for one of them.\r\n(Currently, it is hardcoded to `/usr/bin/docker-runc`)\r\n\r\n### Keeping docker-1.12\r\nBesides of the above things, If we want to keep docker-1.12, we need to differentiate the ansible script based on the version flag as well.\r\nThe mounting directory for `runc` will vary between `/run/runc` and `/run/docker/runtime-runc/moby`.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/483195067/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/483196947","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/4430#issuecomment-483196947","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/4430","id":483196947,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MzE5Njk0Nw==","user":{"login":"markusthoemmes","id":1289147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODkxNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1289147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes","html_url":"https://github.com/markusthoemmes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-15T10:27:17Z","updated_at":"2019-04-15T10:27:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I

\r\nAs you can see in the altered PR I have finally decided against removing the `reportFailure` method. \r\n\r\nReasoning: \r\nI finally understood that the underlying problem causing duplicate metrics and log markers was that some of the methods threw exceptions of type `Exception`. \r\nWith that`reportFailure` was not able to distinguish between those cases and other probably connection related exceptions and was not able to decide to not send the metric again.\r\n\r\nOne option would have been to remove sending the metric in the first case. But this would have caused loss of specific error information. So I decided to introduces specific ArtifactStoreExceptions for all of missing cases (following the pattern of the already existing and used `PutException`).\r\n\r\nWith that the core problem of sending metrics twice was solved.  \r\nI now could have moved the decision logic out of `reportFailure`into new or existing `recoverWith`sections. \r\nIn my opinion this would have lead to code duplication which was not worth the gain of making the decision more local to the originating place.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/486134486/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/486265454","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/4455#issuecomment-486265454","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/4455","id":486265454,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NjI2NTQ1NA==","user":{"login":"cjelger","id":24548615,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQ4NjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24548615?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjelger","html_url":"https://github.com/cjelger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjelger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjelger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjelger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjelger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjelger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjelger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjelger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjelger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjelger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-24T14:27:37Z","updated_at":"2019-04-24T14:27:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm not a scala developer and it definitely looks weird to me (something like a merge between `ruby` and `perl`), but it seems the issue is coming from:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/blob/master/core/controller/src/main/scala/org/apache/openwhisk/core/controller/Actions.scala#L505","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/486265454/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/486279615","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/4455#issuecomment-486279615","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/4455","id":486279615,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NjI3OTYxNQ==","user":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-24T15:01:08Z","updated_at":"2019-04-24T15:01:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks @cjelger for reporting this - we should make it possible to update an action to a non-deprecated kind.

Even if a container runs with volume mapping, it will be paused after 50ms.\r\nSince we can add volume at container creation time, it will induce a bigger ColdStart time.\r\nAnd if you are thinking of a shared volume at the host level, you need to take care of a concurrent modification issue. Also, one user's volume should not be accessed by the others, you need proper permission and multi-tenancy support as well. I think there might be more issues than I described.\r\nSo it is generally recommended to use object storages for serverless.\r\n\r\nIf you still want to try the way, I think `DockerClient` would be a good starting point.\r\nSince users should be able to configure their volume, one option could be relying on annotations.\r\nSo users would specify volume information in annotation and OpenWhisk adds volume mapping based on the information at container creation time. \r\n\r\nSince I pondered on this shortly and naively, please consider that there would be some issues.\r\n\r\nAnd you may find this useful for this kind of discussion.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#discussion\r\n\r\nWe have slack channels and dev mailing

the functional point of view, this PR is now ready for merge. All tests are successful and the testcases also work when nodejs:10 is the default nodejs runtime.\r\n\r\nMost comments have been addressed.\r\nExcept of moving the check of the exec annotation into a subroutine. This is the check:\r\n```\r\n      .convertTo[Seq[JsObject]]\r\n      .find(_.fields(\"key\").convertTo[String] == \"exec\")\r\n      .map(_.fields(\"value\"))\r\n      .map(exec => { exec.convertTo[String] should startWith(\"nodejs:\") })\r\n      .getOrElse(fail())\r\n```\r\nThe checks (at 7 places) are in multiple classes so we would need something outside to them. I tried to find a good place for such a common subroutine for the tests, but I was not really successful. But I am not that deep in openwhisk, yet, and my Scala skill is not at expert level... yet :-). \r\nTherefore hints and tricks are highly welcome :-).\r\n\r\nDepending on how important it is to merge this PR right now...

thanks a lot for providing this PR - very thorough work. Particularly, the performance tests are helpful for deciding whether the update to a newer Docker version is a feasible.\r\n\r\nSome thoughts around the transient data directory `docker-runc` is using for containers:\r\n* When Docker 18.06 uses `docker-runc`, directory `/run/docker/runtime-runc/moby` is used as base directory.\r\n* `docker-runc` itself has different default directories that are used when not specifying the `--root` option. These are `/run/runc` for root (uid 0) and `/run/user/<uid>/runc` for non-root users.\r\n* Apparently, all uses of `docker-runc` need to make sure that they use the same data directory as Docker - otherwise `docker-runc` won't be able to work on the containers created by Docker before.\r\n* In `ansible/roles/invoker/tasks/clean.yml`, you explicitly use the `--root` option to make sure the proper directory is used.\r\n* You have no changes in the Scala `RuncClient` used by the invoker. (BTW - the comment is wrong.)\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/blob/c68fc94212009d3a5cd98d6ea7e06482272c487b/core/invoker/src/main/scala/org/apache/openwhisk/core/containerpool/docker/RuncClient.scala#L56-L64\r\n* The Scala `RuncClient` works because you always mount the (configurable) transient data directory location to `/run/runc` in file `ansible/roles/invoker/tasks/deploy.yml` and `docker-runc` is run by root user.\r\n* What happens if the invoker process is run by a non-root user? Won't `docker-runc` invoked by Scala `RuncClient` then fall back to the default transient data directory, i.e. `/run/user/<uid>/runc`?\r\n* I do not know the details of lean setup - but what happens in other setup variants? Do we always make sure that the proper transient data directory location is available at `/run/runc` when running Scala `RuncClient`? Which user runs the process?\r\n* Can we make things more robust by also using the `--root /run/runc` option in Scala `RuncClient`?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/490030169/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/490078912","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/4430#issuecomment-490078912","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/4430","id":490078912,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MDA3ODkxMg==","user":{"login":"sven-lange-last","id":17647888,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NjQ3ODg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17647888?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sven-lange-last","html_url":"https://github.com/sven-lange-last","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sven-lange-last/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sven-lange-last/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sven-lange-last/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sven-lange-last/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sven-lange-last/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sven-lange-last/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sven-lange-last/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sven-lange-last/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sven-lange-last/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-07T13:27:19Z","updated_at":"2019-05-07T13:27:19Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@style95
