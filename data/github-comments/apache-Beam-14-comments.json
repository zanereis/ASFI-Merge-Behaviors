The purpose is to remove the dependencies of Spark and Flink runner on Beam to enable them to run the WordCountIT in examples, as Dataflow currently does. As things were in the codebase, both Spark and Flink depended on examples for some of the code in WordCount.java and TfIdf.java. In the Flink case I've removed the tests; in the Spark case I've just added the code in. I'd love to hear your guys' thoughts on what the right thing to do is going forward.\n\nThe benefit we get from this is that this is where the new End-to-End tests seem to be going, such that they can be written in a runner-agnostic way and then run just by flipping a few flags (for example, see the commands below for running this test).

That POM doesn't have a surefire plugin section, so it does not explicitly set the `beamTestPipelineOptions`. On my machine that wasn't a problem but on travis the last active setting for `beamTestPipelineOptions` seems to be used. I copied this section from the Java Examples pom to make it work:\n\n```\n<plugin>\n  <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>\n  <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>\n  <configuration>\n    <systemPropertyVariables>\n      <beamTestPipelineOptions>\n      </beamTestPipelineOptions>\n    </systemPropertyVariables>\n  </configuration>\n</plugin> \n```\n\nI verified that this is actually what happens by printing the `beamTestPipelineOptions`, in this log we can see that the wrong settings are used for the Java 8 Example tests: https://s3.amazonaws.com/archive.travis-ci.org/jobs/131433948/log.txt. (Search for `[INFO] Building Apache Beam :: Examples :: Java 8 All 0.1.0-incubating-SNAPSHOT`\n\nBefore, this wasn't a problem because there we're no other POMs that were setting this property.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/220365331/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/220383000","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/350#issuecomment-220383000","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/350","id":220383000,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMDM4MzAwMA==","user":{"login":"tgroh","id":429866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTg2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/429866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh","html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-19T16:42:49Z","updated_at":"2016-05-19T16:42:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"R:
