Search before asking\n\n-[X] I had searched in the [issues](https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues?q=is%3Aissue) and found no similar issues.\n\n\n### What happened\n\nBased on the previous methods such as dingtalk and email components, I developed components suitable for myself: telephone alarms and internal OA message push. The local test was correct, but after packaging and deployment, I found that they were not added to the deployment directory. The lib/plugin/alert folder still contains the original plugins. Is there something wrong with the build process?\n\n### What you expected to happen\n\nThe plugin component can be loaded as many times as possible.\n\n### How to reproduce\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42203474/138236750-f810dc5b-d447-4582-abb6-7decb341bc21.png)\r\nI successfully configured and developed it successfully, and it was correctly declared in the outermost pom.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42203474/138236847-3aa1c013-6169-469a-aac2-f6a5b10a50b6.png)\r\n\n\n### Anything else\n\nMy two components are also configured with their own pom.xml, and the local test is all ok.\n\n### Are you willing to submit PR?\n\n-[X] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n-[X] I
