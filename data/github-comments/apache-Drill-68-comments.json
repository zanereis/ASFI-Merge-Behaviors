According to their website, LGTM takes the codebase, \"generates a database to represent the codebase\", then uses codeQL to run queries on the database to generate alerts. They use data science to identify the errors (from analyzing a lot of other projects and finding common errors).\r\n\r\n2. It depends. Sometimes, alerts are a false-positive (incorrect); however, pertaining to drill, most of the alerts were meaningful as they were valid issues that needed to be fixed; however, some of them are not. For example, \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71536798/112870474-4016f680-908c-11eb-8cf4-cc809fa74b6e.png)\r\nThis already has a guard if the counter is greater than the length of the data, despite that, it still throws the alert, and so I tried to use a try and catch statement.\r\n\r\nAlso, like I said in my previous comment. Sometimes the value is initialized in the null value as an arbitrary value so that it can be used later. Just declaring it isn't enough as it causes an error. \r\n\r\n3. For hashcode, it recommends overriding both `hashCode` and `equals` methods to ensure they're consistent. The thing is, in most cases, there is no hashCode or equals method.\r\n\r\ne.g \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71536798/112872150-06df8600-908e-11eb-9c6f-8b74c4cf0add.png)\r\nThis results in this hashcode alert\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71536798/112872311-3a221500-908e-11eb-8ce2-af6cc489271f.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nFor nulls, it recommends to ensure that the value is not null when its dereferenced. \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71536798/112872646-99802500-908e-11eb-92b0-bd39b418ffd4.png)\r\n\r\nThe thing, the alert is essentially explaining that the value might be null b/c it was initialized as so, but thats because it has to be arbitrary initialized so that it can be called in different statements.

For some reason, Github does not notify me of new comments, even though I'm a \"watcher.\" Odd.\r\n\r\nThanks also for the explanation and generated code. I agree with your analysis. If we ever do a \"revised edition\" of the Drill book, we should explain this detail.\r\n\r\nI wonder: is this the only remaining function that has this problem? When I quickly glanced through the UDFs, it seemed some used the pattern like the one you are using here, others use the \"wrong\" pattern. Should we fix all of them to avoid having to fix them one by one?\r\n\r\nAlso, the reason that I said that one of the VARCHAR fields would probably be null is because of the name of the function:\r\n\r\n``` java\r\n  public static class ConcatRightNullInput implements DrillSimpleFunc {\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe seem to also have:\r\n\r\n``` java\r\n  public static class ConcatLeftNullInput implements DrillSimpleFunc {\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich, by the way, has the same bug you are fixing here.\r\n\r\nThere is also:\r\n\r\n``` java\r\n  public static class ConcatBothNullInput implements DrillSimpleFunc {\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor which, presumably, both inputs are NULL (zero length), but we still allocate a buffer, and that code has the bug you are fixing. Of course, if both inputs are NULL, then there length is undefined (NULL says to ignore the value; we cannot assume that the string value is the empty string or that the start/end offsets are valid.)\r\n\r\nFinally, we also have:\r\n\r\n``` java\r\n  public static class ConcatOperator implements DrillSimpleFunc {\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich does use both inputs, and which already has the fix you propose here.\r\n\r\nThis is what I meant: we have multiple variations of the same function, some are fixed, some are still broken. The variations claim that one or both sides are NULL, but we are still working with the (possibly invalid) VARCHARs in those cases, when we should not.\r\n\r\nNow, because things are not complex enough, we have another issue. If either of the arguments of `CONCAT(left, right)` are the SQL NULL value, then the output should be... the non-null argument? Or, NULL? At least according to [SQL Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/functions/concat-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15), the rule is that a NULL value is treated as an empty string. We should thus modify the three `Null` variations to do that: use an empty string, *not* the value of the null argument. That is, for `ConcatRightNullInput`, return the left input. For `ConcatLeftNullInput`, return the right input. For `ConcatBothNullInput`, return an empty (zero-length) string.\r\n\r\nI hope this clarifies things a bit!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/811694253/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/811846074","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2183#issuecomment-811846074","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2183","id":811846074,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxMTg0NjA3NA==","user":{"login":"luocooong","id":50079619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMDc5NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50079619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/luocooong","html_url":"https://github.com/luocooong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luocooong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luocooong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luocooong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luocooong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luocooong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luocooong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luocooong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luocooong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luocooong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-01T11:34:35Z","updated_at":"2021-04-01T11:34:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@paul-rogers Thanks for the review.

The fix is probably not correct. As explained earlier, the goal is to 1) use the YARN config by default, unless, 2) overridden in the DoY config file. Here is the default config from `drill-on-yarn-defaults.conf`:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndrill.yarn: {\r\n  ...\r\n  dfs: {\r\n    connection: \"\"\r\n    app-dir: \"/user/drill\"\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe code says:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    String dfsConnection = config.getString(DrillOnYarnConfig.DFS_CONNECTION);\r\n    try {\r\n      if (DoYUtil.isBlank(dfsConnection)) {\r\n        fs = FileSystem.get(yarnConf);\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, if the `dfs.connection` property is blank, use the one from the YARN config file.\r\n\r\nAgain, why might there be a different DoY value? Because some users push apps to multiple servers, and the DoY config should be sufficient to do so, without having to have multiple different YARN configs available. (If, in practice, people use only one config, we can remove these DoY configs if not needed. But, let's assume they are needed.)\r\n\r\nSo, the question is, why did the user see the bug which was reported? Where did the `\"hdfs://localhost/\"` value come from? **That** is the bug we need to fix.\r\n\r\nThe answer seems to be that someone used `drill-on-yarn-example.conf` as their config, without inspecting if the *example* values are useful. (This is an *example*, not a *default*.):\r\n\r\n```\r\ndrill.yarn: {\r\n  ...\r\n  dfs: {\r\n    # Connection to the distributed file system. Defaults to work with\r\n    # a single-node Drill on the local machine.\r\n    # Omit this if you want to get the configuration either from the\r\n    # Hadoop config (set with config-dir above) or from the\r\n    # $DRILL_HOME/core-site.xml.\r\n\r\n    connection: \"hdfs://localhost/\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhy is that being used? The proper \"default\" file is `drill-on-yarn-override.conf` from `distribution`. But, it looks like the `component.xml` file is missing a line. So, maybe the user renamed the example file to `drill-on-yarn-override.conf`. We need:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n    <file>\r\n      <source>src/main/resources/drill-on-yarn-override.conf</source>\r\n      <outputDirectory>conf</outputDirectory>\r\n      <fileMode>0640</fileMode>\r\n    </file>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the above Maven fix, we don't need to change the code: the code does what it is supposed to do, if given a proper (blank) config entry.\r\n\r\nAn \"extra for experts\" fix is to add the updated port number to the example file above.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/812928381/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/812961546","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2183#issuecomment-812961546","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2183","id":812961546,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxMjk2MTU0Ng==","user":{"login":"luocooong","id":50079619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMDc5NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50079619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/luocooong","html_url":"https://github.com/luocooong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luocooong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luocooong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luocooong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luocooong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luocooong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luocooong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luocooong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luocooong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luocooong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-04T02:58:14Z","updated_at":"2021-04-04T02:58:14Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I agree. @oleg-zinovev Thanks for the PR.
