a lot for your comments. I did a pass, including:\r\n- Renamed `getOrInferCoder` to `inferCoder`, removed `coder` argument\r\n- Removed `deserialize` method and the null bytes hack\r\n- Close deserializers\r\n- Added `readWithCoders` and `writeWithCoders`\r\n- Rewrote the Javadoc a bit\r\n- Handle classes with multiple interfaces, added a test\r\n\r\nWith `readWithCoders` and `writeWithCoders`, manually calling `with{Key,Value}Coder` is no longer necessary in cases where inference does not work. I would still leave them around, but simply do not mention them in the main Javadoc. This means the following usages:\r\n\r\n- you use `with{Key,Value}Deserializer` with a Kafka deserializer. This avoids an extra level of wrapping, so this is probably preferable in the simple cases.\r\n- you use `readWithCoders` with `Coder`s. This is good for backward compatibility or if you do not want to develop a custom Kafka deserializer. I'll let you judge to what extent this collides with `Do not use coders as a general serialization or parsing mechanism` from the style guide.\r\n\r\nSame with writing. What do you think?\r\n\r\nStill missing:\r\n- tests for `readWithCoders`, `writeWithCoders` (and their Avro instantiations )?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/296387403/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/296390361","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/2519#issuecomment-296390361","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/2519","id":296390361,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NjM5MDM2MQ==","user":{"login":"chamikaramj","id":10819857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODE5ODU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10819857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj","html_url":"https://github.com/chamikaramj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-22T17:55:38Z","updated_at":"2017-04-22T17:55:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks Robert for creating the benchmark.
