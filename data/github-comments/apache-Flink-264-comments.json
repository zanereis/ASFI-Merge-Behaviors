I think the configuration split is reasonable. If I only need to start the history server then I don't rely on other configurations, and I don't need to pay attention to other configurations.\r\n\r\nRegarding the discussion of compatibility, I basically agree with @zentol  's point of view.\r\n\r\nBasic on the existing implementation, I think we can add more log warnings in the new method of `GlobalConfiguration`. The general idea is as follows:\r\n\r\n* Judge the new configuration file, if it does not exist, I will add a log to inform the user that he is using the old configuration;\r\n* If the new configuration and the old configuration about history server exist at the same time,  then we will warn the user that there are two configurations and we will base on the `flink-historyserver-conf.yaml`;\r\n\r\nIn addition, I will give a log warning when the configuration file is loaded by the `HistoryServer#main` method, for example : \r\n\r\n> the current configuration about history server in `flink-conf.yaml` is only for backward compatibility, it is recommended that they enable the new configuration file `flink-historyserver-conf.yaml`.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I will comment out the configuration items in the `flink-historyserver-conf.yaml`, considering that we have done so many guides, I believe users will be more likely to accept the correct guidelines.\r\n\r\nEven if it is based on a configuration already in `flink-conf.yaml`, the current implementation will still work. But if we say that there are configurations in both files, we seem to have no better way than to give a warning \"based on `flink-historyserver-conf.yaml`\".","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/412736043/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/412743884","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6339#issuecomment-412743884","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6339","id":412743884,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMjc0Mzg4NA==","user":{"login":"tisonkun","id":18818196,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4ODE4MTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18818196?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun","html_url":"https://github.com/tisonkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-14T03:33:42Z","updated_at":"2018-08-14T03:33:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"ping

for the improving Flink's Python API @yanghua. As far as I can tell, the changes look good to me. I would additionally like to hear @zentol opinion whether the test is enough.\r\n\r\nThere is no discussion/proposal yet how to proceed with Flink's Python support. There are, however, ideas how it could be tackled. One idea is to offer Python support through Beam, because the Python functionality in Beam is quite advanced and would allow people to run all kinds of Python libraries in their UDFs. Nothing is set in stone yet, but please keep in mind that Flink's own Python API might be affected by this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/412812237/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/412815785","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6532#issuecomment-412815785","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6532","id":412815785,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMjgxNTc4NQ==","user":{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-14T09:43:51Z","updated_at":"2018-08-14T09:43:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Merged, thanks for the reviews!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/412815785/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/412816175","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6532#issuecomment-412816175","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6532","id":412816175,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMjgxNjE3NQ==","user":{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-14T09:45:17Z","updated_at":"2018-08-14T09:45:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@zentol Ah, I saw that typo fix too late.

I will further verify the `StreamNetworkThroughputBenchmarkExecutor` as you mentioned and show your results after done. :)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/413127511/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/413141040","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6359#issuecomment-413141040","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6359","id":413141040,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMzE0MTA0MA==","user":{"login":"Jiayi-Liao","id":13514599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTE0NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13514599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiayi-Liao","html_url":"https://github.com/Jiayi-Liao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiayi-Liao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiayi-Liao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiayi-Liao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiayi-Liao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiayi-Liao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiayi-Liao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiayi-Liao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiayi-Liao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiayi-Liao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-15T09:16:06Z","updated_at":"2018-08-15T09:16:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@twalthr I add a literalValue in GeneratedExpression, because the case class cannot be inherited.

\r\nI've replied a few coments above and optimize some codes according to your coments.\r\nI've finished:\r\n1. Null value configuration.\r\n2. Schema derivation.\r\n3. some optimizations.\r\n\r\nAbout the encoding: The encoding for csv data can only be one of elements of com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonEncoding, and the jackson reader is able to automatically detect the encoding according to the rules of [rfc4627](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt). So we don't need to set the encoding mannually, and we can't allow users to use other encodings that JsonEncoding doesn't support, such as 'latin'.\r\n\r\nAbout the byte array: The byte array logic is weird because of the internal logic of the jackson that I explained in CsvRowSerializationSchema(line: 159). We regard the byte array as string to avoid unnecessary logic because jackson use base64 to deal with byte array(CsvGenerator: line 691), which means our users cannot give their original byte array, otherwise they cannot get original content after serializing or deserializing(see the codes below). Additionally, byte array is regarded binaryNode in jackson, so we cannot convert byte array like what we do with other array. \r\n\r\n```\r\nbyte[] origin = \"123\".getBytes();\r\nCsvSchema schema = CsvSchema.builder()\r\n\t\t.addColumn(\"a\", STRING).build();\r\nCsvMapper cm = new CsvMapper();\r\nJsonNode result = cm.readerFor(JsonNode.class).with(schema).readValue(origin);\r\nbyte[] transformed = result.binaryValue();\r\nSystem.out.println(Arrays.equals(transformed, origin)); (expect true, actual false)\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/413285602/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/413307845","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6530#issuecomment-413307845","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6530","id":413307845,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMzMwNzg0NQ==","user":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-15T19:26:38Z","updated_at":"2018-08-15T19:26:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Merging

, I think I got the reason of regression in some non-broadcast cases. \r\n\r\nThe key point is when to call `RecordSerializer#prune()` which is used to decrease the intermediate serialization buffer. In the past, the prune method was only called after the target copying buffer is full and the record is full. But now after emitting each record we will call to prune method in order to narrow down the intermediate buffer ASAP. So the performance may be regression in sensitive job scenarios. I will modify to keep the previous behavior of calling prune in serializer.\r\n\r\nThanks for your benchmark to find this potential issue. I only verified the broadcast scenarios in benchmark before and the obvious advantage may hide the potential regression.
