It could impact slower query systems though (Hive launching multiple queries would eat up cluster resources). Having global timeouts might also be tricky as some users will want to run some slower queries.\n\nMaybe we could have a query timeout per slice, similar to cache timeout? This would be the number of seconds the query has to run before it will be terminated. I think the `connect_args` allows for timeout, so it would be sent with the query. Maybe this timeout could also be provided in the slice editor? Again, probably not the best solution, just brainstorming.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/234617455/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/234617974","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/809#issuecomment-234617974","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/809","id":234617974,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNDYxNzk3NA==","user":{"login":"xrmx","id":12932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx","html_url":"https://github.com/xrmx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-22T18:20:07Z","updated_at":"2016-07-22T18:20:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"_caravel

connection string is teradata://user:password@dbhost/ . The dialect I'm using is a modified version of Teradata's SqlAlchemy with more methods implemented (https://github.com/mrbungie/sqlalchemy-teradata/tree/feature/dialect_get_columns) and with some fixes regarding schemas.\n\nI explored the dialect looking for something and found nothing. But like I said, it's weird because it only happens with MySQL as Caravel's backend.\n\nMore info:\nOriginal dialect: https://github.com/Teradata/sqlalchemy-teradata\nhttps://developer.teradata.com/tools/articles/teradata-sqlalchemy-introduction\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/236376645/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/236426630","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/869#issuecomment-236426630","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/869","id":236426630,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNjQyNjYzMA==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-31T12:13:14Z","updated_at":"2016-07-31T12:14:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/builds/7238819/badge)](https://coveralls.io/builds/7238819)\n\nCoverage remained the same at 81.145% when pulling **a48b31d1ff3267a36d2637eb06dff91aa63468b7 on xrmx:noflaskext** into **ee9141a31a84c7c1114163995edb718f89372a15 on airbnb:master**.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/236426630/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/236426768","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/868#issuecomment-236426768","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/868","id":236426768,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNjQyNjc2OA==","user":{"login":"xrmx","id":12932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx","html_url":"https://github.com/xrmx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-31T12:16:23Z","updated_at":"2016-07-31T12:16:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Which browser is this?
