The default level is set to \"query statemachine directly”, which, while latency-friendly, has led to user-reported bugs. Specifically, these bugs relate to the production of inconsistent results in subsequent SQL queries during a restart, creating a phantom read problem that may be confusing for our users.\r\n> \r\n> To address this issue, I propose that we temporarily increase the read consistency level to linearizable read during restarts. This will ensure that we maintain data consistency during the critical recovery period. Once the cluster has successfully finished recovering from previous logs, we can then revert to the default consistency level.\r\n\r\nLGTM~ Song is a true master of Ratis indeed🤩","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/1641288702/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/1641293977","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iotdb/pull/10597#issuecomment-1641293977","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/10597","id":1641293977,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCXnElM5h1CiZ","user":{"login":"Cpaulyz","id":43774645,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzc0NjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43774645?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cpaulyz","html_url":"https://github.com/Cpaulyz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cpaulyz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cpaulyz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cpaulyz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cpaulyz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cpaulyz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cpaulyz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cpaulyz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cpaulyz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cpaulyz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-19T02:36:53Z","updated_at":"2023-07-19T02:36:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Excellent work!
