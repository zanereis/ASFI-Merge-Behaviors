Wanted to see how the data is written to s3. What is the best way to create tables with hoodie file formats ?\r\nFew thoughts in my mind -\r\n- Accessing s3 file system through api should be doable, similar to how spark reads from s3. \r\n- Where do we use strong consistency in Hoodie ? Do we write timestamps when files were written to s3. It sometimes takes little longer to see the files written on s3 because of eventual consistency (usually very few seconds for large files). Can we handle eventual consistence in code by adding waits/checks to ensure file has been written and is visible?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/288547488/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/288558828","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/110#issuecomment-288558828","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/110","id":288558828,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4ODU1ODgyOA==","user":{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-22T22:24:45Z","updated_at":"2017-03-22T22:24:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"you can see https://github.com/uber/hoodie/pull/95 for adding s3 support..
