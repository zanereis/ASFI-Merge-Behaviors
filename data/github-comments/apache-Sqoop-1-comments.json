StringBuilders are inefficient, char arrays are a lot faster since everything is pre-allocated already. Furthermore, the overhead over constantly allocating a new object, and the fact that internally the StringBuilder will do some copying as well, make this an inefficient approach.\n\nFor example, I implemented your approach and instead of a 500% improvement with our method, I have a 230% increase in performance with the StringBuilder approach. So the char-array is definitely a lot faster, and this is what it is all about, since this is a very prominent function during the conversion to Avro.\n\nKind regards,\n\nJoeri\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/sqoop/issues/comments/208859666/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/sqoop/issues/comments/214450599","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/sqoop/pull/19#issuecomment-214450599","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/sqoop/issues/19","id":214450599,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNDQ1MDU5OQ==","user":{"login":"afine","id":223386,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzM4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/223386?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afine","html_url":"https://github.com/afine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afine/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-25T17:28:20Z","updated_at":"2016-04-25T17:28:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @FuqiaoWang.

These changes were motivated by a project at GM to move significant data sets to Greenplum. Because Greenplum is currently still in version 8x of postgress we added support for the 8x syntax of the copy command. We also noticed that implementing line buffering in the mapper would significantly enhance performance. Also we conventionally use a char for field delim which happens to be invalid XML char so we added support for non-xml delims with direct mode.\r\n TODO: put the same changes to the 9.x COPY syntax.

@szvasas,\r\nThanks for pointing this out!\r\nI ran the command `./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version 5.3.1`, and then force pushed as I also noticed a typo in the decription and wanted to correct that as well. \r\n\r\nIn any case, this is a proper upgrade now, albeit to 5.3.1 that is a deprecated version. I just realized this, I'll update the version to 5.4.1, if all tests pass that is the version we should use, it's the currently supported one.\r\n\r\nNot sure why Oracle tests failed...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/sqoop/issues/comments/500786500/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/sqoop/issues/comments/501240473","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/sqoop/pull/81#issuecomment-501240473","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/sqoop/issues/81","id":501240473,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMTI0MDQ3Mw==","user":{"login":"fszabo2","id":2507965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MDc5NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2507965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fszabo2","html_url":"https://github.com/fszabo2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fszabo2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fszabo2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fszabo2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fszabo2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fszabo2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fszabo2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fszabo2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fszabo2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fszabo2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-12T11:55:08Z","updated_at":"2019-06-12T11:55:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @ebogi,\r\nThanks for the review!
