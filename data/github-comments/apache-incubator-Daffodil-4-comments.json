Lazy evaluation with value capture is essential to get linear behavior. Changing lazy vals to def can cause an exponential growth in computation simply recomputing the same thing multiple times (when that recomputation is happening in a recursive nest). So the rule of thumb is use def for abstract methods or methods with arguments or constants. Use lazy val everywhere else, and nothing can use side-effect or order-of-evaluation dependent computations. This of course applies to the schema compiler. Once we get to the runtime engine, imperative java-style code is the rule, and lazy evaluation and functional programming idoms like map/reduce/fold/loop-comprehensions are pretty much not used at all.

There is a scala compiler plugin called [genjavadoc](https://github.com/lightbend/genjavadoc) that will generate javadocs from scala source files. You don't actually need to use the unidoc plugin to get this feature. The latest version of this scalac compiler plugin is 0.16.\r\n\r\nThe sbt-unidoc plugin essentially just takes java/scaladocs from subprojects and combines them into one big java/scaladoc. The 0.4.3 is the version of the sbt-unidoc plugin. Note that sbt-unidoc also acts as a wrapper around genjavadoc, so you gen generate javadocs for a subproject using the scala compiler plugin, and then sbt-unidoc will pull those in when it combines everything.\r\n\r\nSo in short, one version is for the sbt-unidoc plugin, the other is for the genjavadoc plugin that it wraps.\r\n\r\nI originally did a visual inspection and things looked the same. To confirm, I just ran a diff to see what the actual changes were:\r\n1. Javadoc includes a generation timestamp. I'm thinking it make sense to include the {{-notimestamp}} option when generating docs so we don't get a 1000 line diff of just timestamps.\r\n2. The order of two rows in a deprecation table are randomly flipped. No idea why this happened, but it doesn't really matter I guess.\r\n3. I modified the root-doc.txt file, which is apparently included in many scaladoc files as a tooltip. This diff is expected, but the tooltip should be something different instead of the entire contents of that file. I'll see if that's easy to fix.\r\n4. The UDF API additions, which is also expected.\r\n\r\nSo all diffs are expected. I think it's worth ammending this PR to disable timestamps and fix the tooltip.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/658820715/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/658839830","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/397#issuecomment-658839830","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/397","id":658839830,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1ODgzOTgzMA==","user":{"login":"stevedlawrence","id":3180601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODA2MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3180601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence","html_url":"https://github.com/stevedlawrence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-15T15:36:56Z","updated_at":"2020-07-15T15:36:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Github isn't updating this PR with new commits to the branch.

It does mean we need to fix the entire code base to be consistent, which might be a big task. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/680145541/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/682003346","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/409#issuecomment-682003346","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/409","id":682003346,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4MjAwMzM0Ng==","user":{"login":"stevedlawrence","id":3180601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODA2MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3180601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence","html_url":"https://github.com/stevedlawrence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-27T14:58:20Z","updated_at":"2020-08-27T14:58:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Also, a minor comment about commit subjects.

The only concession I've made for Windows in my Ubuntu 20.04 environment's `~/.gitconfig` is to tell git to ignore files' executable bit in case a Windows program has created a file in my git checkout or my checkout is in a Windows filesystem instead of an Ubuntu filesystem:\r\n\r\n```ini\r\n[core]\r\n        filemode = false\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou may want to try WSL too which will allow you to mix and match your favorite development tools as you wish.

But the latest versions of Spark supports 2.12, so it should probably be fine to drop.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/701399356/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/701409798","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/424#issuecomment-701409798","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/424","id":701409798,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwMTQwOTc5OA==","user":{"login":"stevedlawrence","id":3180601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODA2MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3180601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence","html_url":"https://github.com/stevedlawrence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-30T14:00:18Z","updated_at":"2020-09-30T14:00:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hmm, I think maybe codecov had a hiccup?

I would say enough work has been done on my fork and now it's time to get more eyes, discussion, and collaboration on the runtime2 backend by building out the rest of the C code generator in public instead of my fork.  However, I can't predict how much pushback I would get from Daffodil developers if their sbt build starts trying to compile C source files as well as Scala source files.  I think it makes more sense to let multiple developers collaborate and experiment with the runtime2 backend on a new branch until we reach broad agreement on how the runtime2 backend should look and how it should affect the main Daffodil build.  That's why I picked the name `wip-daffodil-2202-runtime2` for the new branch.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/701419675/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/701442102","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/422#issuecomment-701442102","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/422","id":701442102,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwMTQ0MjEwMg==","user":{"login":"mbeckerle","id":1524099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1524099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle","html_url":"https://github.com/mbeckerle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-30T14:51:39Z","updated_at":"2020-09-30T14:51:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I suggest the branch we put this on not be named \"wip-\" prefix, because it's only a wip until it isn't, also daffodil on the branch name isn't needed.

We probably don't need all 8, 9, and 11, but I think we need at least 8 for long term support, and at least the latest version (which we're behind, 13 has been out for a while, and I think I heard there's some failure 13). And we definitely need windows vs linux, we've had a handful of bugs that only appear on one OS. So I think the minimum we need is 4 (windows + linux + 2 java version).

As long as the patch checks pass that feels reasonable. If the check fails, it provides a link to the report for the details that's in the codecov report. That feels sufficient to me.

I would be surprised if the codecov reports differ for Java 8, 9, and 11 although I would expect small differences for Linux and Windows.  \r\n\r\nSpeaking of Java versions, I don't think we need to worry about non-LTS releases anyway.  Java now has a fast channel, every six months, and a slow channel, every three years.  Each third-year release is called an LTS release.  Java 8 is the previous LTS release, Java 11 is the current LTS release, and 17 will be the next LTS release.  Unless there's a reason to test non-LTS releases, I'd chuck out Java 9 and test only Java 8, 11, and then 17 when it comes out.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/704477532/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/704480296","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/426#issuecomment-704480296","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/426","id":704480296,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwNDQ4MDI5Ng==","user":{"login":"stevedlawrence","id":3180601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODA2MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3180601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence","html_url":"https://github.com/stevedlawrence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-06T18:48:13Z","updated_at":"2020-10-06T18:48:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Yeah, we probably can drop 9.

Again, I'm struggling to create a simple test for this, but I think the code is fairly clear.\r\n\r\nThe issue here was that when we call setFinished on a DOS we deliver all the following buffered DOS's that have been finished so that we can release finished buffers. However, when we deliver multiple buffers, we always use the same ``FormatInfo`` as the original direct DOS. But Buffered DOS can change bitOrder, so the FormatInfo (which is where we get bitOrder) needs to change depending on the DOS. The fix is to save the FormatInfo associated with a buffered DOS when it is finished, and then use that when that DOS delivers buffered content. This allows the FormatInfo to change while delivering buffered content as we deliver different DOS.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/707706463/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/707710350","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/431#issuecomment-707710350","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/431","id":707710350,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwNzcxMDM1MA==","user":{"login":"jw3","id":1545372,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDUzNzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1545372?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jw3","html_url":"https://github.com/jw3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jw3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jw3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jw3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jw3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jw3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jw3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jw3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jw3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jw3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-13T12:38:55Z","updated_at":"2020-10-13T12:41:14Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Have

At the end of unparsing, the DIDocument should have a single child, the root element. If that root element isn't used in an expression it should get set to null. So at the end of a parse, the DIDocument child(0) should be null if not used in an expression. But that only tests that we were able to free the root element. It's possible things were broken so that no a single other element was freed and the only thing actually freed was the root element. And since the root elemen was freed, there's no way to know if any of it's children were freed--we no longer have any access to it or it's children.\n\nMaybe the best way to ensure this is working correctly is to just develop tests that would fail with OutOfMemory errors if we weren't cleaning up infoset correctly. Those tests would likely be too large/take too long to keep in the Daffodil repo, but I believe @dfthompson<https://github.com/dfthompson> is working on some tests that live in Owl's internal test infrastructure. Once those are done, we might want to find a place where those can be made public so others can test them.\n\n—\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub<https://github.com/apache/incubator-daffodil/pull/437#discussion_r506448616>, or unsubscribe<https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AALUDA3C6CIZTTQYZQ7JQEDSLBF7ZANCNFSM4SSADTDQ>.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/710086512/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/710093650","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/437#issuecomment-710093650","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/437","id":710093650,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxMDA5MzY1MA==","user":{"login":"stevedlawrence","id":3180601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODA2MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3180601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence","html_url":"https://github.com/stevedlawrence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-16T14:50:33Z","updated_at":"2020-10-16T14:50:33Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Doesn't seem totally unreasonable.
