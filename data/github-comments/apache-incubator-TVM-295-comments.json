Can you add more substantial test cases to your tests? E.g. different input shapes and those of different ranks at least for some of the relevant ops. I feel that some issues might come to light from this. Do not worry about PR size anymore\r\n> 2. Please add type annotations to functions for this and future PRs. e.g.\r\n> \r\n> def myFunc(a: int, b: List[string]) -> None: ...\r\n\r\n- More cases have been added in tests, but only for the new operators in this pull request. I will send another pull request for the previous operators.\r\n- Type annotation is a good code habit, but for the function like `convert_dot(g : GraphProto, op : paddle.fluid.framework.operators, block: paddle.fluid.framework.Block)`, the type annotation will bring dependency of paddlepaddle for TVM, I noticed that all the frontends putting framework importing in `from_xxx` function to avoid strong dependency for TVM.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/933273751/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/933340283","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/8838#issuecomment-933340283","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8838","id":933340283,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM43oaR7","user":{"login":"abhikran-quic","id":63697863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNjk3ODYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63697863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhikran-quic","html_url":"https://github.com/abhikran-quic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhikran-quic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhikran-quic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhikran-quic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhikran-quic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhikran-quic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhikran-quic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhikran-quic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhikran-quic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhikran-quic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-04T10:13:12Z","updated_at":"2021-10-04T10:13:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @tmoreau89 , I've raised https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/9186 for `com.microsoft.MatMulInteger16`.

@areusch,\r\n\r\n> i agree CI is not a personal testing environment, but it is sometimes the easiest way for developers to access cloud platforms they don't have e.g. arm, gpu.\r\n\r\nI do empathise with this, but I don't think we should design a CI solution around the edge cases, by reducing the overall running jobs we can get to these faster when they do arise.\r\n\r\n> @Mousius the comment you referenced is a bit more general and i'm not sure this specific issue contributes to CI taking a while to complete. you can monitor CI if you're anxious for the test results. \r\n\r\nThere's two things this change fixes:\r\n1. Machine availability - we keep overall machines free-er to start a job than they previously were as we fail out of them faster\r\n2. Machine saturation - running multiple tasks on a single machine is going to result in `n` slow jobs, the fewer jobs you run the more compute you have free.\r\n\r\nI don't rely on CI for test results, but I can definitely feel the reluctance of waiting for CI to complete once you have a green tick given your change is then delayed to likely the next day each time.\r\n\r\n> in practice this seems most likely to result in cancellation of GPU integration tests, but the number of available GPU executors has not been 0 in the past month. perhaps we should track that stat for a bit now that #9128 is in. i am wondering if maybe it already somewhat addressed this concern.\r\n\r\nWe should be very careful about considering the number of executors available as a metric as to how efficient CI is. When a Jenkins agent is under load from one set of branch builds it will have a negative effect on any other thing also running - so whilst we may never run out of executors on paper, this change would result in them being less loaded and thus more efficient at running CI jobs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/933732684/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/933735097","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/9136#issuecomment-933735097","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/9136","id":933735097,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM43p6q5","user":{"login":"areusch","id":532957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/532957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch","html_url":"https://github.com/areusch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-04T18:17:18Z","updated_at":"2021-10-04T18:17:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"let

@hogepodge for pushing this.\r\n\r\n- Just noticed that there are files that are moved and lost history(e.g.  For example, `device_target_interactions.rst`).  It would be great to keep all the history (by starting from the original state, run git mv to get the files into the right location, then copy over the changes). \r\n- There are also format that was due to possible editor auto-format wrapping, these are something that we can do as followups, but we also need to make sure one editor setting do not override another one. One thing to note is that it might be useful to introduce an automatic formater to ensure consistency as a later point.\r\n\r\nOne idea is we start with a PR that only contains git mv and minimum set of changes to get the index right. Then we send into text polishment in followup smaller PRs\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/933906489/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/933908410","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/9168#issuecomment-933908410","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/9168","id":933908410,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM43qk-6","user":{"login":"areusch","id":532957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/532957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch","html_url":"https://github.com/areusch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-04T22:37:56Z","updated_at":"2021-10-04T22:37:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"please

\r\n> I do empathise with this, but I don't think we should design a CI solution around the edge cases, by reducing the overall running jobs we can get to these faster when they do arise.\r\n\r\nI kind of agree, but not sure 100% here. For example, suppose there are iterative test failures on ci-arm as well as test failures on ci-gpu, neither of which you have available locally. If you push to CI, you'll wind up using resources to rebuild on all platforms.\r\n\r\n> There's two things this change fixes:\r\n\r\n> 1. Machine availability - we keep overall machines free-er to start a job than they previously were as we fail out of them faster\r\n> 2. Machine saturation - running multiple tasks on a single machine is going to result in n slow jobs, the fewer jobs you run the more compute you have free.\r\n> I don't rely on CI for test results, but I can definitely feel the reluctance of waiting for CI to complete once you have a green tick given your change is then delayed to likely the next day each time.\r\n\r\nI guess I am open to trying this, but I feel a bit like we should publicize this in the forum in case anyone else is attached to the current setup. My example came from an internal OctoML ask of me. I think I feel like this because I'm not sure we have hard metrics to consult.\r\n\r\n> We should be very careful about considering the number of executors available as a metric as to how efficient CI is. When a Jenkins agent is under load from one set of branch builds it will have a negative effect on any other thing also running - so whilst we may never run out of executors on paper, this change would result in them being less loaded and thus more efficient at running CI jobs.\r\n\r\nAh! I agree this is the case right now, but I am sort of scheming to change this with the `xdist` work. Right now it is indeed possible to run > 1 PR on a node at once. With xdist, it'll be possible to use the entire node's resources on a single PR. I haven't worked out the details yet, but would propose we do this for test-cases and then it will be possible to treat queue-depth as a measure of CI load :).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/933956298/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/933957506","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/9190#issuecomment-933957506","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/9190","id":933957506,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM43qw-C","user":{"login":"areusch","id":532957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/532957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch","html_url":"https://github.com/areusch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-05T00:23:26Z","updated_at":"2021-10-05T00:23:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"cc

It'd greatly help our ability to write good C++ tests to have GMock setup properly - although I'm only using the headers iirc so it works without referencing `gmock` or `gmock_main`.\r\n\r\nI'm also not going to suggest we don't do this until we figure all that out, I had just hoped it'd be easy enough to do :smile_cat: ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/936778921/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/936827803","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/9213#issuecomment-936827803","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/9213","id":936827803,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM431tub","user":{"login":"gromero","id":3375505,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzU1MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3375505?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero","html_url":"https://github.com/gromero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-06T18:13:43Z","updated_at":"2021-10-06T18:15:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@leandron Just crossed it when wrapping up things for `tvcm micro`. wdyt?
