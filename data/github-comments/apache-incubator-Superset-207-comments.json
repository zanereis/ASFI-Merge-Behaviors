Assuming your database is in async mode, here's some of what's happening. You can track some of this using `statsd` logging if it's configured\r\n* query executes:`sqllab.query.time_executing_query`\r\n* fetching data: `sqllab.query.time_fetching_results`\r\n* state is changed to `rendering`\r\n* data is pushed to results backend: `sqllab.query.results_backend_write`\r\n* client is polling\r\n* data is available, request is sent to get the full result set\r\n* fetching over network\r\n* actual rendering on the browser starts\r\n\r\nIf you can just limit your query, all of this will be much faster.\r\n\r\nThe reason why the postgres client is fast, is that it doesn't fetch all the data upfront, at step 2 (fetching data), it fetches a page and shows it. The cursor is kept alive and can be used to retrieve more rows as you scroll.\r\n\r\nWe could improve all this to be more seamless/faster, but operating in async mode makes all of this more complicated. I think we'll improve this over time. One approach would be to deliver the data in two phases, with a new state `partially-delivered` or something like that.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/479351139/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/479351638","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/7160#issuecomment-479351638","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/7160","id":479351638,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3OTM1MTYzOA==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-03T06:01:33Z","updated_at":"2019-04-03T06:01:33Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Stackoverflow's SEO is great.

But personally, I've commented in a few question issues because I couldn't find anywhere to get an answer, particularly regarding questions of great importance to adoption, such as what release candidate to use and the overall status / direction of the project. Furthermore, I commented on a PR that patched a vulnerability stemming from a dependency and still haven't gotten any detail on what the actual vulnerability is, and don't know if the various upgrades required (across release candidates) to merge the changes into my production instance will break my install. The difficulty in getting answers I think causes people to come here for lack of other options, so making a clear statement on where to go for support would be a big help. Sadly, this has led me to have to qualify every instance of my recommendation of this awesome project with negative caveats.\r\n\r\nThere's some activity on the Slack instance, but from what I've seen and experienced many questions go unanswered. I don't think that it's a good place to handle support, especially since the history limit will cause answers to be lost, resulting in spam as the same questions are asked repeatedly. It's also proprietary and requires signing up just to search.\r\n\r\nWhile Stack Overflow is also proprietary, it does have excellent SEO that makes it easy for people to find answers to existing questions, as it's designed to produce long term support resources. It also doesn't require signing up to view answers (unlike if Slack was the preferred option).\r\n\r\nA mailing list is the most open solution, but they tend to devolve into chaos.\r\n\r\nUltimately, an official avenue for support combined with a clear way to understand project status would hopefully reduce the incidence of general questions that have filled up GitHub issues.\r\n\r\nI also suggest enabling the GitHub wiki for this project, if only to be a place to collect the top FAQs and perhaps to relay news. This can be edited more easily than constantly committing new README files.\r\n\r\nThank you all for your hard work on this project!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/479895186/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/479923682","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/5741#issuecomment-479923682","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/5741","id":479923682,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3OTkyMzY4Mg==","user":{"login":"RameshByndoor","id":3341964,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDE5NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3341964?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RameshByndoor","html_url":"https://github.com/RameshByndoor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RameshByndoor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RameshByndoor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RameshByndoor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RameshByndoor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RameshByndoor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RameshByndoor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RameshByndoor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RameshByndoor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RameshByndoor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-04T14:36:18Z","updated_at":"2019-04-04T14:36:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks This is very important feature.

The problem is that SQL Lab makes most calls with the parameters in the path, and for some reason escaped slashes (`%2f`) are converted to real slashes by most webservers (a security issue of some sort I believe). For table names this had been worked around by using the `path:` prefix in the Flask routing, but this doesn't work when there are multiple parameters with slashes (both table and schema in this case). A workaround I found for this was to perform escaping twice in the frontend (`/` turns into `%2f` which turns into `%252f`), and then unescaping them twice in the backend. Anyway, I'll see if there's a better way to do this or clean up the code as much as possible and put in a PR when
