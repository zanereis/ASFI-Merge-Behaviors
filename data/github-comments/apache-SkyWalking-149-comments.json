No matter which parameter(or ID) you gave the error log, the backend can't cache/persistent the context. It will be easy to crash the backend as endless memory requirements. Also, you should know, the backend is in the cluster mode, as millions of browser could be opened at the same time, every time you report the data, there is one or multiple Gateways(LBs) to forward the data to a random OAP cluster node, which may or may not have the context(cached) even we could afford the memory. \r\n\r\nOnly solution I could have is, the client knows this is the first report or further report for every page, we could add a flag in the log report protocol to indicate this.

Error details are needed to analyse code error location.\r\n\r\nContext is not the log itself. Context is which PV has an error log already or not. Think in this way\r\nthere are 1 -> 1,000,000,000 page accesses, each one of them has random [0, 5) errors. Then now, the client-js reports an error log, if following your proposal, the backend need to query all existing 1m access and check whether this page has been counted as an error, then error count could be +1. But meanwhile, there is other 1m accesses happen in the next several seconds. Could you imagine how much payload this design gives the system?\r\nThat is typical and classics error when we talked about distributed systems and distributed statistics.  The backend design must make sure affordable resource usage. This principle keeps as always in agent upstream protocol and tracing analysis in all language agents. That is why I said `Theoretically, it could help the calculation, but in engineering practice, it can't`. We increase a little complexity at the agent side, but tradeoff higher performance at the backend and storage. This makes SkyWalking could widely used and cost reasonable VMs(A.K.A. money for the end users)\r\nHope this explanation could make you more clear.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/585008534/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/585026276","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/4352#issuecomment-585026276","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/4352","id":585026276,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NTAyNjI3Ng==","user":{"login":"dengliming","id":7796156,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3OTYxNTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7796156?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengliming","html_url":"https://github.com/dengliming","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengliming/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengliming/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengliming/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengliming/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengliming/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengliming/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengliming/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengliming/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengliming/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-12T04:43:46Z","updated_at":"2020-02-12T04:44:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Is
