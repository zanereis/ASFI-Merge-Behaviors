Localizing is good.  However, we are summing over the user map for every activation so if there are a lot of users this might become a bottleneck.  Probably not worth worrying about as even 10K users would still cause it to take maybe 100K cycles (since L2 cache hit is about 10/cycle) which would be about 0.05ms.  Of course, as we scale up anything that is O(users) on every invocation will be unsustainable.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/248682557/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/248682743","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/1166#issuecomment-248682743","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/1166","id":248682743,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0ODY4Mjc0Mw==","user":{"login":"perryibm","id":14339749,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzM5NzQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14339749?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/perryibm","html_url":"https://github.com/perryibm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perryibm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perryibm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perryibm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perryibm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perryibm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perryibm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perryibm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perryibm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perryibm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-21T17:25:20Z","updated_at":"2016-09-21T17:25:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Reminder:  update go cli (python gone)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/248682743/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/248682875","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/1297#issuecomment-248682875","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/1297","id":248682875,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0ODY4Mjg3NQ==","user":{"login":"paulcastro","id":17145014,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MTQ1MDE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17145014?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulcastro","html_url":"https://github.com/paulcastro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulcastro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulcastro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulcastro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulcastro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulcastro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulcastro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulcastro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulcastro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulcastro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-21T17:25:48Z","updated_at":"2016-09-21T17:25:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Documentation updated.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/248682875/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/248683453","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/1301#issuecomment-248683453","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/1301","id":248683453,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0ODY4MzQ1Mw==","user":{"login":"perryibm","id":14339749,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzM5NzQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14339749?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/perryibm","html_url":"https://github.com/perryibm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perryibm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perryibm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perryibm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perryibm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perryibm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perryibm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perryibm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perryibm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perryibm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-21T17:27:54Z","updated_at":"2016-09-21T17:27:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks -

for the writeup @sjfink . \n\na few thoughts / comments on this:\n- naming: instead of gateway', what about calling it '(api-)mapping'? the rationale is...we're not allow crud operations of gateways or descriptors of gateways, but rather of these mappings?\n- have we thought through what the master record of these mappings is going to be? eg if we allow creating them via the ow api -- where would we be storing them? e.g. if we store them in the ow db and in the gw itself, we might run into integrity problem given users can also interact with the gw without going through the ow api.\n- cardinality / lifecycle dependency: what constitutes the boundaries of a mapping? eg if i execute `wsk action restify <actionname>`, i assume that is going to result in the creation of mapping for that action, right? how would i add more routes to a mapping (eg would i have to specify the mapping name (to your earlier point) as part of `wsk action restify`? can a mapping refer to multiple actions (i think the answer should probably be 'yes', given a mapping is imho an expression of an api)

We are thinking about having the user input that is specified in a file be what is sent directly to the REST interface. For example, a file could contain this JSON `{\"paramKey\": \"paramValue\"}`, which would be forwarded to the backend for create invocations. With our current functionality that would be the equivalent of passing `-p paramKey paramValue`, which would be converted to `{\"key\": \"paramKey\", \"value\": \"paramValue\"}` before sent to the backend.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/248959839/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
