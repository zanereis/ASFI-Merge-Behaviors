Of course nobody is **really** forced to do anything but they would need to front-load 15h or so of yak shaving and a significant dose of ambition if they wanted to avoid expanding the filter.

I could care less about the webapp spec, webapp's are terrible, but filter init / process is fairly fundamental and unlikely to be gotten wrong by any container out there, other than perhaps a short lived high level blunder. Plenty of things up the stack they would be toast on if this was a standard problem.\n\nMore likely someone was looking at tests when they looked at that particular race.
