Looking at our supported indexer must of them don't need a pre-defined schema (Kafka, rabbitmq, elastic-rest, elastic, etc.). For Solr, a schema is normally required (although recent versions do have a [schemaless mode](https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/7_0/schemaless-mode.html#using-the-schemaless-example).  The issue boils down to how the user starts Solr.\r\n\r\nIf a Solr instance was started without schemaless mode then it will fail to index the data in which case there is no clear way of knowing which fields to add in the schema other than trial&error (or checking each enabled plugin)\r\n\r\nIf the user starts Solr with the schemaless mode, the schema is not entirely needed.\r\n\r\nI do recognize that this file is used by a single indexer plugin which is a conditional dependency (using or not Solr). We _could_ move the config file into the plugin directory (`src/plugin/indexer-solr`) and update the documentation/README making the file available on the distribution (otherwise the user will have to download it). It is possible that putting it in this new location makes it clear that it is not used by Nutch itself but provided for the Solr users.\r\n\r\nThe `schema.xml` file is not required but provided as a commodity/guide for Solr users.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/comments/527144600/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/comments/527175555","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nutch/pull/468#issuecomment-527175555","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/468","id":527175555,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNzE3NTU1NQ==","user":{"login":"sebastian-nagel","id":1630582,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzA1ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1630582?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastian-nagel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-02T14:55:08Z","updated_at":"2019-09-02T14:55:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1\r\n\r\nThe schema.xml but it isn't removed by this PR, right?

Let me try to rephrase what was my naive understanding of the issue, how I intended to fix it and what is wrong about it.\r\n\r\nWhat I saw is indexing to csv worked locally but failed in a distributed setup (with only 3 nodes). The reduce step emitted errors when writing data to GCS. At the end, there was something containing roughly a third of the expected dataset. I assumed I had 3 reducers overwriting each other with only one winner at the end (or a mix of winning output blocks). So I thought \"if only I could map the CSVIndexWriter output file to a reducer to separate each reducer output, that would solve the issue\".\r\n\r\nWhat you are saying is:\r\n- In addition to distributed mode requiring the writers output to be separated, there is a lot of complexity involved with dealing with eventually consistent object stores (I will assume that GCS works roughly like S3). Ideally we would like reducers output to appear in the outpath only if the tasks or jobs succeed, which involves the commiter logic you referenced. But in an initial implementation we may not care about that. If the indexing fails, partial output will be left in outpath and such is life (I am OK with that).\r\n- I assumed that NutchAction writes in a given reducer are serialized. It it no clear to me if this is correct or not.\r\n- Exchanges introduce additional complexity in that a single NutchAction can be handled by more than one writer. I do not see what would be the issue with this assuming each writer output are separated. If I have 2 writers with an outpath set to \"out1\" and \"out2\", in a reducer generating a \"part-r-0001\", the actions would go either in  \"out1/part-r-0001\" or \"out2/part-r-0002\" or both. I do not see overlapping writes there.\r\n- Same reasoning with `there is also the open question how to allow two index writers writing output the filesystem:`. Again I assume the writers have distinct output \"directories\" and the active reducer defines a unique output file name, so the combination of both should be unique.\r\n- About `\"name\" was just an arbitrary name not a file name indicating a task-specific output path`, maybe but does anything prevents it to be used that way? `getUniqueFile` seems suitable here.\r\n\r\nWith this current understanding, I would now implement it like:\r\n- Kill `open(Configuration cfg, String name)` method, if possible (I haven't checked the code yet).\r\n- Refactor `open(IndexWriterParams params)` into `open(IndexWriterParams params, String name)`, where `name` would be the same thing passed to the other method.\r\n- In CSVIndexWriter, use `name` directly and drop the `filename` kludge I introduced.\r\n- Maybe implement a fallback of the previous method to the new one with a dummy argument.\r\n\r\nHow far am I?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/comments/642730043/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/comments/643149619","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nutch/pull/534#issuecomment-643149619","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/534","id":643149619,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MzE0OTYxOQ==","user":{"login":"sebastian-nagel","id":1630582,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzA1ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1630582?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastian-nagel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-12T08:36:42Z","updated_at":"2020-06-12T08:36:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the exhaustive listing. I have only a few points to add.\r\n\r\n> I assumed that NutchAction writes in a given reducer are serialized. It it no clear to me if this is correct or not.\r\n\r\nThe MapReduce framework takes care of data serialization and concurrency issues: the reduce() method is never called concurrently within one task - tasks run in parallel and that's why every task needs it's own output (part-r-nnnnn). The name of the output file (the number in n) is also determined by the framework - that's important if a task is restarted to avoid duplicated output.\r\n\r\n> writers have distinct output \"directories\" and the active reducer defines a unique output file name, so the combination of both should be unique.\r\n\r\nI think we need 3 components:\r\n- the task-specific file or folder (part-r-nnnnn)\r\n- a unique folder per index writer (eg. the name or a path defined in index-writers.xml)\r\n- a job-specific output location - you do not want to change the index-writers.xml for that if you run another indexing job\r\n\r\nIn short, the path of a task output might look like: `job-output/indexer-csv-1/part-r-00000.csv`\r\n\r\n> getUniqueFile\r\n\r\nYou mean [ParseOutputFormat::getUniqueFile](https://github.com/apache/nutch/blob/59d0d9532abdac409e123ab103a506cfb0df790a/src/java/org/apache/nutch/parse/ParseOutputFormat.java#L120]? ParseOutputFormat or [FetcherOutputFormat](https://github.com/apache/nutch/blob/master/src/java/org/apache/nutch/fetcher/FetcherOutputFormat.java) are good examples as they write output into multiple segment subdirectories. Hence, there are no plugins involved which determine whether there is output written to the filesystem or not.\r\n\r\n> Maybe implement a fallback of the previous method to the new one with a dummy argument\r\n\r\nThat could be done using default method implementations in Java 8 interfaces. Note: Nutch requires now Java 8 but it started with Java 1.4 and there is still a lot of code not using features of Java 8.\r\n\r\nAlso, to keep the indexer usable (because most index writers (solr, elasticsearch, etc.) do not write output to the filesystem): if nothing is written to the filesystem IndexingJob should not require an output location as command-line argument.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/comments/643149619/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/comments/643256957","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nutch/pull/534#issuecomment-643256957","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/534","id":643256957,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MzI1Njk1Nw==","user":{"login":"pmezard","id":1430779,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzA3Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1430779?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmezard","html_url":"https://github.com/pmezard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmezard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmezard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmezard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmezard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmezard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmezard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmezard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmezard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmezard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-12T12:59:16Z","updated_at":"2020-06-12T12:59:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you for the details.\r\n\r\nOne thing I wonder is if it would not be possible to define the index-writers specific path as their identifier in index-writers.xml, at least by default.
