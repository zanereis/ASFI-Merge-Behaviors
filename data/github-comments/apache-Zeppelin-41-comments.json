None of them are intended as part of the PR.  Please keep in mind the PR was originally in August, so there are a lot of opportunities for artifacts like this to arise.   \n\nOne of the remaining tasks I have, is to eliminate changes that aren't necessary to the PR.  Part of that is comparing against current master to make sure inadvertent reversions like these aren't taking place.  That's one of the items on your task list, and it isn't complete yet.  \n\n The intended changes to the PR are:\n- under r/\n- A few changes under spark/\n- Under docs/\n- A small number of changes to the spark-related dependencies in pom files\n\nThere are also some changes -- not many -- that are not related to the PR, but were necessary to get Zeppelin to compile at all.  For example, when I pulled recent changes last night, there were syntax errors in one of the javascript files.  I imagine that these are issues that relate to other PRs conflicting, or to errors in the rebase process. But they will show-up in this interface as changes in the PR. \n\n@jongyoul Yes, you're correct.  That isn't intended as part of the PR.

I feel #714 is quick approach, but stability and features provided by DataTable are good and rich. **Also to remove confusion Data-tables table-tool (retired and replaced by buttons extension) used FLASH, but new buttons plugin dont need FLASH if your browser support HTML5**. \nYou can confirm this from below URL that it dont need FLASH.\n\n[https://www.datatables.net/extensions/buttons/examples/html5/simple.html](url)\n\nAs per my experience when we have multi-line text in a single cell (Header or Data cell) or text in a single cell separated by tab or comma, DataTable is good in handling that.There are many such issues where DataTable had provided solution, and if we implement custom export than we have to handle them.\n\nAlso see below URL, where we can select columns to export, pagination, filtration.\n[https://www.datatables.net/extensions/buttons/examples/html5/columns.html](url)\n\nSo as per my thought integrating DataTable instead of custom export, can remove issues already handled and fixed by DataTable and this will also make way for having more features in Zeppelin

progress @elbamos thank you! @jongyoul thank you for keeping an eye\n\nPlease excuse me, most of comments above are on issues 5-7 and may be preliminary, but hope we could nail them down as well.\n\nWe need 5 (clarify license\\headers) before fixing the CI, as Apache license header check is one of the steps of the build and will fail the CI if not present.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/185150683/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/185168739","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/702#issuecomment-185168739","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/702","id":185168739,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4NTE2ODczOQ==","user":{"login":"btiernay","id":2717578,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MTc1Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2717578?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/btiernay","html_url":"https://github.com/btiernay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btiernay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btiernay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btiernay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btiernay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btiernay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btiernay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btiernay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btiernay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btiernay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-17T11:47:42Z","updated_at":"2016-02-17T11:47:42Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"http://zeppelin-project.org/docs/dynamicform.html\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/185168739/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/185176664","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/702#issuecomment-185176664","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/702","id":185176664,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4NTE3NjY2NA==","user":{"login":"btiernay","id":2717578,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MTc1Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2717578?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/btiernay","html_url":"https://github.com/btiernay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btiernay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btiernay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btiernay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btiernay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btiernay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btiernay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btiernay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btiernay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btiernay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-17T12:23:13Z","updated_at":"2016-02-17T12:23:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Also,

is a few values or function, that seems out of place to me, for example:\n`$scope.paragraph.interpreterRestarting` should probably not be at paragraph level, but at Notebook level since interpreters are linked to Notebook.
