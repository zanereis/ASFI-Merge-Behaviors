Just glob them from the `transform` module.\r\n- In #3236, Marisa writes \"we can also bake this into the pass manager: each pass will have to specify three more argument: FeatureSet input_features, FeatureSet add_features, FeatureSet remove_features, that denote which feature can this pass handle, which feature it may add, and which feature it will remove.\" From my understanding of the pass manager code, it seems like `PassInfo` might be the most logical place to add these things.\r\n- Are you asking whether we'll need to save the state of the passes, to check whether they abide by the add_features/remove_features they've specified? If so, we might start with the easiest solution, which would be to _not_ save the before/after state of the pass, and _not_ check whether it abides by its claimed add_features/remove_features. Instead, we could just use this meta-data in the CI tests that we create. These CI tests will inspect a pass, get its input_features/add_features/remove_features, and select test programs with the appropriate features. It'll run the passes over those test programs and ensure that add_features/remove_features is not violated.

The *good news* is that I was able to find the root cause of the observed bug. By changing the `conv2d_transpose_nchw` function signature by adding the `output_padding` argument, we are essentially changing the TOPHUB schedule lookup convention for that operator. In other words, AutoTVM fails to find the schedule for the conv2dtranspose operator because the argument list of the operator doesn't match. Due to this, the schedule defaults to an illegal one for VTA which triggers the error we're seeing in the CI.\r\n\r\nIn order to circumvent the error the fix will be straightforward on your end: just change `v0.06` to `v0.07` here: https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/blob/master/python/tvm/autotvm/tophub.py#L59\r\n\r\nI've updated the schedule for VTA with this commit: https://github.com/uwsampl/tvm-distro/commits?author=tmoreau89\r\n\r\nEssentially I changed the DCGAN schedules from \r\n`[\"conv2d_transpose_nchw\", [1, 64, 4, 4, 1, 16, \"int8\"], [32, 64, 4, 4, 16, 16, \"int8\"], [2, 2], [1, 1], \"int32\"]` \r\nto \r\n`[\"conv2d_transpose_nchw\", [1, 64, 4, 4, 1, 16, \"int8\"], [32, 64, 4, 4, 16, 16, \"int8\"], [2, 2], [1, 1], \"int32\", [0, 0]]`\r\n\r\nThe *bad news* is that this will need to be modified for all hardware targets under tophub. For instance the CUDA schedule will need to change: https://github.com/uwsampl/tvm-distro/blob/master/tophub/cuda_v0.06.log#L690 among other targets. \r\n\r\nIn order to do so, I recommend first creating new schedule files under a new \"package version\" and then switching the package version in your PR in `tophub.py` in order not to break other unit tests. The reason why this is not causing an error is that CPUs and GPUs schedules default to valid, albeit slow ones (VTA is just unstable and not all schedules will lead to correct execution, we need a better defaulting mechanism).\r\n\r\nFinally, I also created a branch that will fix some scripts under VTA that will be affected from your change. If you could cherry pick my commits into your branch that would be great: https://github.com/tmoreau89/tvm/tree/4318_fix","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/557766083/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/557768279","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4324#issuecomment-557768279","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4324","id":557768279,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1Nzc2ODI3OQ==","user":{"login":"kevinthesun","id":15520525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTIwNTI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15520525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinthesun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-23T05:16:49Z","updated_at":"2019-11-23T05:16:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@icemelon9 Looks like the performance gap is not huge for cpu.

How shall we implement `SparsePlaceholder` with varying length in the `idx` and `val` variables?\r\n2. As TVM current `ComputeOp` don't support computation upon varying length vectors, how do we bring this into `SparseComputeOp`?\r\n3. Have you consider how to perform `Vectorize` and `Tensorize` operation upon sparse tensors? The lowering steps would be very much different with dense tensors, and we might need to maintain `masks` for performing `Vectorize`, along with varying length vectors like `indices` and `values`.\r\n4. Do we support automatic sparsity regularization in this RFC, or just inference with existing sparse tensors? If the answer is we only support inference, how shall we import exiting sparse tensor in existing frameworks to demonstrate the capability?\r\n5. Which layout shall we start with? NHWC or NCHW ?\r\n6. I think we should preserve the `SparseTensor` operators to be easily quantized with existing code base, at least with small modifications.\r\n\r\nAnother challenge we also have to consider is that it's hard to introduce sparsity into depth-wise convolution operators, while depth-wise convolution is very useful in modern neural networks. It will be very challenging to work on **sparse** depth-wise convolution.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/557969198/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/557970826","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/4403#issuecomment-557970826","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4403","id":557970826,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1Nzk3MDgyNg==","user":{"login":"liangfu","id":857821,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1NzgyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/857821?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu","html_url":"https://github.com/liangfu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-25T03:26:55Z","updated_at":"2019-11-25T03:26:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Shall the `basic primitives` implemented in the runtime?

One easy workaround is to apply vectorization along a dense tensor dimension if there is one. For many practical examples, tensors won't be sparse along all dimensions. But the question gets more tricky when that assumption does not hold.\r\n\r\nAnd due to the dynamism of varying idx/val arrays, this can create an interesting discussion around how autoTVM will be used on more dynamic operators.
