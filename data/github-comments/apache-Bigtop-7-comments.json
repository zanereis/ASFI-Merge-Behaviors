Prepare 3 Nodes: \r\n```\r\nNode1: ambari-server\r\nNode2: ambari-agent01\r\nNode3: ambari-agent02\r\n\r\n```\r\n2.  Install ambari-server.rpm on ambari server and ambari-agent.rpm on ambari agents respectively.\r\n\r\n3. Modify Ambari server hostname to `/etc/ambari-agent/conf/ambari-agent.ini` which is located on Ambari agent nodes.\r\n\r\n4. Install chrony and start chronyd service for time-sync among nodes.\r\n\r\n5. Install  bgtp-mapck on Ambari server:\r\n`sudo ambari-server install-mpack --mpack=/path/bgtp-ambari-mpack-1.0.0.0-SNAPSHOT-bgtp-ambari-mpack.tar.gz --purge --verbose`\r\npath is  `/var/lib/ambari-server/resources` that defines in `install_ambari.sh` .\r\n\r\n6. Restart Ambari server and agents\r\nAmbari server node: `ambari-server restart`\r\nAmbari agents: `ambari-agent restart`\r\n\r\n7. Access Ambari webui:\r\n```\r\nambari-server-ip:8080 \r\nadmin/admin\r\n```\r\n\r\n8. Deploy Hadoop by Ambari facility.\r\n\r\nThis mpack may be regarded  as a minimal definition. It just includes hdfs, mapreduced, yarn and zookeeper services in it. We will add more services to it in future.\r\n\r\nI would like to add deployment document like `Readme `to `bigtop-packages/src/common/ambari/`.\r\n\r\nAnd the ambari smoke test module was deprecated and doesn't work by using Odpi stack.\r\nPlease give me few days to add new smoke tests by using this new Bgtp stack.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/comments/562415260/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/comments/563884656","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bigtop/pull/566#issuecomment-563884656","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/566","id":563884656,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2Mzg4NDY1Ng==","user":{"login":"JunHe77","id":17865359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODY1MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17865359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunHe77","html_url":"https://github.com/JunHe77","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunHe77/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunHe77/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunHe77/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunHe77/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunHe77/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunHe77/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunHe77/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunHe77/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunHe77/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-10T06:25:20Z","updated_at":"2019-12-10T06:25:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@evans-ye , added smoke tests for Elasticsearch.

The `./gradlew hadoop-pkg -Dbuildwithdeps=true` command I executed builds zk first, and [it installs the generated jars into the local .m2 repository](https://github.com/apache/bigtop/blob/ab8208768ce93c7c5ef119779e179e86dec3ac81/bigtop-packages/src/common/zookeeper/do-component-build#L30-L31).\r\nI succeeded in building Hadoop by removing those jars and running the same command without the `-Dbuildwithdeps=true` option, so probably there's something wrong in the zk's build process.
