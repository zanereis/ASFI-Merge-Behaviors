I think we have two cases to distinguish:\n1. Typos in comments and documentation: These can just be done via large pull requests, and the review should be very easy.\n2. Typos in APIs, with the two important categories:\n   1. Typos in APIs marked `private` or `@Private`: The same as above applies. We can trust each other that a pull request only changing those doesn't change anything else.\n   2. Typos in `public` APIs not otherwise marked as internal: Those _should_ go trough a deprecation cycle.
