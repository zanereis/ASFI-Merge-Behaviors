It looks hard to fill empty values of complex columns especially when we use a javascript aggregator because the broker does not know what the type of argument is in a javascript function. Although the broker gets the type information by `AggregatorFactory.getTypeName()`, it is not a actual type of column to be accssed. A javascript aggregators returns `float` as its type name;\n\nHow about showing only timestamp without any values for empty buckets like the below?\n\n```\n{\n  \"timestamp\" : \"2013-09-04T23:00:00.000Z\",\n  \"result\" : {\n    \"langHyperUnique\" : 0,\n    \"longMin\" : null,\n    \"longSsum\" : null,\n    \"count\" : null,\n    \"sum(strlen(language))\" : null,\n    \"sum(log(added))\" : null,\n    \"uniqLang\" : 0,\n    \"longMax\" : null\n  }\n```\n\nBy the way, as-is `skipEmptyBuckets` works this way. The first is empty one. `longMin` shows `9223372036854775807` and `longMax` is `-9223372036854775808` which dosen't seem to be good in some cases(I am not sure).
