I opened the following PR for that test case (admittedly I forgot about this one so we can close mine if you’d like) - #4859\r\n> \r\n> TLDR - As suggested by Russell, for the test case in my PR, we changed the “olderThan” argument to be further in the future. The benefit being no unnecessary busy waiting and all of the files are still caught. I went with 5 seconds given that the solution in the other PR adds no busy waiting and that specific test removes _every_ orphan file so the olderThan argument doesn’t need to be very precise… just far enough “in the future” relative to the timestamp of the files that Spark writes to grab them all.\r\n\r\nHi @kbendick - thanks for the suggestion, however, the test that you are fixing in #4859 (TestRemoveOrphanFilesAction#orphanedFileRemovedWithParallelTasks) requires all the files to be removed. Thus providing a future time would ensure that Predicate selects all the files as candidates for removal.\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, for this PR (TestRemoveOrphanFilesAction#testOlderThanTimestamp), we intentionally want to wait until a second has passed to avoid scenarios like [mtime from java is truncated to seconds](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24804618/get-file-mtime-with-millisecond-resolution-from-java) where we loose tracking millisecond precision while getting lastModification time.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe flow for this test is as follows:\r\n- spark writes non-table files to tableLocation\r\n- spark writes non-table files to tableLocation\r\n- spark writes non-table files to tableLocation\r\n- delete orphan files such that only files created from the first two writes are removed and the file created from the third write is preserved\r\n\r\nAnd because of this caveat of preserving the files from the third, we'll have to busy wait for a second.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1139330018/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1139365255","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4866#issuecomment-1139365255","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4866","id":1139365255,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85D6VWH","user":{"login":"singhpk234","id":35593236,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NTkzMjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35593236?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhpk234","html_url":"https://github.com/singhpk234","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhpk234/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhpk234/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhpk234/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhpk234/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhpk234/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhpk234/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhpk234/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhpk234/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhpk234/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-27T07:45:07Z","updated_at":"2022-05-27T07:45:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Apologies from my oversight here, Thanks @rdblue :) !!!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1139365255/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1139372412","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/4875#issuecomment-1139372412","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4875","id":1139372412,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85D6XF8","user":{"login":"Cqz666","id":50294123,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjk0MTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50294123?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cqz666","html_url":"https://github.com/Cqz666","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cqz666/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cqz666/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cqz666/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cqz666/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cqz666/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cqz666/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cqz666/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cqz666/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cqz666/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-27T07:54:24Z","updated_at":"2022-05-27T07:54:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@kbendick My main problem was solved via `partial-progress.enabled `and `max-concurrent-file-group-rewrites`. :+1: \r\nBut I still have some confusion, when does it make sense to do the 'removeOrphanFilesAction' job, because you know that rewriting a file leaves an old, useless small file that I don't want to keep forever, but don't know when to do the 'removeOrphanFilesAction' job.

There’s also an iceberg-docs repo, github.com/apache/iceberg-docs. You might need to make a PR there as well.\r\n\r\nSince this is in the versioned part of the docs site, there's no need to open a PR against the iceberg-docs repo. I do think we need a bonafide \"getting started\"/\"quickstart\" flink guide that gives a docker environment and let's the user fully run a demo environment--that would go in the iceberg-docs repo.\r\n\r\nOn a separate note, I'm noticing there are a number of \"Types Compatibility\" subsections that are cropping up for various engines. I'm wondering if we should try and consolidate them to a single \"Types Compatibility\" page, or maybe append it to the Configurations page in PR #4801 (although it's not really 'configuration').","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1139746583/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1139763462","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4878#issuecomment-1139763462","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4878","id":1139763462,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85D72kG","user":{"login":"kbendick","id":9833362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MzMzNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9833362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick","html_url":"https://github.com/kbendick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-27T16:16:07Z","updated_at":"2022-05-27T16:17:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @amogh-jahagirdar and @jackye1995!

I can take a look this weekend.\r\n\r\nIf enough people approve this PR though, I'm not sure I would block on it (it's somewhat outside of my normal area of expertise I should say).

Allow me to elaborate on why I think it is the case.\r\n\r\n> Many of the classes in the REST spec mirror structures from TableMetadata, but when we talked last I thought that we were going to create to_dict / from_dict methods to serialize and deserialize those. Having autogenerated classes for those seems like duplication.\r\n\r\nThat's correct. Having the serialization methods would be replaced by this PR because we get them for free:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n➜  python git:(fd-open-api) python3\r\nPython 3.9.13 (main, May 19 2022, 13:48:47) \r\n[Clang 13.1.6 (clang-1316.0.21.2)] on darwin\r\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\r\n>>> from iceberg.openapi.rest_catalog import PartitionSpec, PartitionField\r\n>>> spec = PartitionSpec(\r\n...   spec_id=123,\r\n...   fields=[\r\n...     PartitionField(\r\n...       field_id=234,\r\n...       source_id=1,\r\n...       name='date',\r\n...       transform='identity'\r\n...     )\r\n...   ]\r\n... )\r\n>>> spec\r\nPartitionSpec(spec_id=123, fields=[PartitionField(field_id=234, source_id=1, name='date', transform=Transform(__root__='identity'))])\r\n\r\n# Serialize\r\n>>> spec.json()\r\n'{\"spec_id\": 123, \"fields\": [{\"field_id\": 234, \"source_id\": 1, \"name\": \"date\", \"transform\": \"identity\"}]}'\r\n\r\n# Deserialize\r\n>>> PartitionSpec.parse_raw(spec.json())\r\nPartitionSpec(spec_id=123, fields=[PartitionField(field_id=234, source_id=1, name='date', transform=Transform(__root__='identity'))])\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think this is much less error-prone as code like this: https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3677/files#diff-9d9a8492ccd85cbbddfc202b9a954b57a079f2cca33e96eb0a9106cf1a4a8130R37-R58\r\n\r\nNext to that, the maintenance cost is much higher when we have to keep it in sync by hand. If we generate it, we can check if we break compatibility (using mypy).\r\n\r\n> Also, I don't think we're getting much out of this. This makes classes that are simple and could easily be statically defined. And it requires an additional library that looks similar to what we get from @dataclass. I'd probably opt not to pull in the additional dependency.\r\n\r\nThis is correct, but we get some more on top of the data classes; validators. Instead of using a builder pattern, we can just nicely validate the input using decorators: https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/validators/\r\n\r\nThis looks like:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> from iceberg.openapi.rest_catalog import PartitionSpec, PartitionField\r\n>>> spec = PartitionSpec(\r\n...   spec_id=123,\r\n...   fields=[\r\n...     PartitionField(\r\n...       field_id=234,\r\n...       name='date',\r\n...       transform='identity'\r\n...     )\r\n...   ]\r\n... )\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 4, in <module>\r\n  File \"pydantic/main.py\", line 341, in pydantic.main.BaseModel.__init__\r\npydantic.error_wrappers.ValidationError: 1 validation error for PartitionField\r\nsource-id\r\n  field required (type=value_error.missing)\r\n```\r\n\r\n> I'm generally unsure about using the OpenAPI doc currently for generating classes, as it's presently intended more for documentation purposes than for usage for models and generating code. To that extent, it seems that the generated classes are at times not that helpful (like Updates).\r\n\r\nI see your point, but it is a bit of a catch-22. Until we start using it, it won't mature. Instead of appending methods to the python classes, it is just as simple as amending the OpenAPI spec and regenerating the code.\r\n\r\n> I've also noticed a lot of variance in the generated code depending on which library is used to do it. I know one Python generation tool I used to generate code made all models just dictionaries... not even classes that were secretly dictionaries but just... dictionaries.\r\n\r\nYes, there is a variety of generators and I found this one the best. It nicely generates all the aliases as well. I already bumped into some issues with the plain python one: https://github.com/openapi-generators/openapi-python-client/pull/618\r\n\r\n> If we get to a place where the OpenAPI doc can be used as a drop-in, that would be great. But talking to some people who are very familiar with OpenAPI, my understanding is that some projects have behavior that's simply more complex than any of the OpenAPI generation tools can really account for. I've been told that either the code has to be written in a very specific style or that it can take years to get to such a place.\r\n\r\nGreat point, and I think we always need to extend the generated classes with convenience methods, or additional validation. How to do this is given in https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4717#discussion_r882941190\r\n\r\n> Is pydantic required if we were to move forward with this or is this just added in this PR for other reasons?\r\n\r\nFor this implementation, pydantic is required: https://github.com/koxudaxi/datamodel-code-generator The code generator specifically generates the pydantic object (and brings in the validation as well). It fits our use-case perfectly: https://python.plainenglish.io/an-introduction-to-the-pydantic-stack-9e490d606c8d\r\n\r\nIt is coming from the FastAPI movement, and it is becoming increasingly more popular. Also, pydantic doesn't pull in the whole universe, it just has one dependency: https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/blob/master/setup.py#L131-L133","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1140056996/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1140068161","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4858#issuecomment-1140068161","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4858","id":1140068161,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85D9A9B","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-27T22:00:48Z","updated_at":"2022-05-27T22:00:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Okay, so assuming that we go this direction, how do we integrate these generated classes with the other code that needs to be there? `PartitionSpec` is a great example, where we can use this to get a `PartitionSpec` object that we can serialize and deserialize properly, along with basic validation.

For example, the Schema derives from the StructType. While in Java/Python, the schema class has a struct as a variable. But we could use the fields in Python 👍🏻 It would also consolidate the naming; currently we use `columns` in Python, in contrast to `fields` in the openapi spec. Or `required` vs `is_optional`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1140323416/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1140334017","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4890#issuecomment-1140334017","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4890","id":1140334017,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85D-B3B","user":{"login":"szehon-ho","id":20555759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTU1NzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20555759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho","html_url":"https://github.com/szehon-ho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-28T21:51:24Z","updated_at":"2022-05-28T21:51:24Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"@nastra @RussellSpitzer @rdblue , let me know, if its ok for 0.13.2?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1140334017/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1140482507","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4893#issuecomment-1140482507","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4893","id":1140482507,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85D-mHL","user":{"login":"singhpk234","id":35593236,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NTkzMjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35593236?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhpk234","html_url":"https://github.com/singhpk234","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhpk234/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhpk234/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhpk234/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhpk234/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhpk234/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhpk234/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhpk234/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhpk234/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhpk234/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-29T16:29:34Z","updated_at":"2022-05-29T16:29:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@nastra, @RussellSpitzer, @rdblue, @szehon-ho please let me know if it make sense to backport this to 0.13.2.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1140482507/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1140487409","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4798#issuecomment-1140487409","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4798","id":1140487409,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85D-nTx","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-29T17:01:52Z","updated_at":"2022-05-29T17:01:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks, @kbendick!
