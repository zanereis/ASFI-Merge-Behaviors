I didn't see any documentation about the other way round though, as it was in the code.  It looks like the [OpenJDK7 FileChannelImpl](http://www.docjar.com/html/api/sun/nio/ch/FileChannelImpl.java.html#121) will call close() on the parent stream, but I figured the safest thing was to just call it on both.\n\nExactly right on the POM changes, I DRY'd up all the versions declared by more than one module to the `<dependencyManagement>` section of the parent POM.  I also added missing declarations to the child POMs for all direct dependencies of each given module.  I'm not sure how much any of these modules will end up as dependencies themselves, but I think it less brittle to declare all direct dependencies rather than counting on transient declarations from upstream.\n\nRegarding the import ordering, I certainly agree with your concern.  I didn't see any IDE metadata, so I wasn't sure what the preferred one was.  My goal was to simply cut down on the volume of trivial Eclipse warnings so that significant ones wouldn't be obscured.  I'll see if Eclipse can't be configured to match IntelliJ's defaults, or just switch to IntelliJ if that's the better option.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/10000823/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/10019287","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/17#issuecomment-10019287","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/17","id":10019287,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwMDE5Mjg3","user":{"login":"cheddar","id":216778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjc3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/216778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar","html_url":"https://github.com/cheddar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-11-02T16:05:10Z","updated_at":"2012-11-02T16:05:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Cool.  I took everything but reverted the import stuff in an attempt to mitigate merge conflicts that people might have.  After the fact I realized that I did it wrong (should've pulled your merge into a local repo and revert that one commit before pushing to master) and probably actually created more merge conflicts than would've existed had I kept it.\n\nAnyway, for import optimization, I generally think it's great (and I have IntelliJ configured to optimize things on check-in), but if the only change to a file is import changes and the import isn't currently causing a bug I generally prefer to let it lie.  As far as Eclipse/IntelliJ stuff is concerned, I don't think fighting over ordering is much of a concern as long as we stick to the rule where we only optimize imports if and when we've made some other change to the actual code of a file.  That way, there will be some substance accompanying the import change and we can trust that both IntelliJ and Eclipse know how to include the correct imports no matter how they are ordered.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/10019287/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/10019470","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/18#issuecomment-10019470","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/18","id":10019470,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwMDE5NDcw","user":{"login":"cheddar","id":216778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjc3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/216778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar","html_url":"https://github.com/cheddar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-11-02T16:11:08Z","updated_at":"2012-11-02T16:11:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Fjy, there are currently 2 pull requests from you that look like the exact same change set.

Before, a lot of the complexity was to keep track of the cost change of given moves.  Outside of a test (e.g. in production), this isn't a problem.

I was thinking of that as a function of the transfer of the data and not necessarily as something that the system would handle automatically.  One reason is because I've been intending to go back and create the ZipInputStream directly on the InputStream object pulled from S3 so that we can just unzip as we pull and save storing the file twice.  (We do notice some IO contention on AWS nodes when pulling down and then unzipping.  AWS is just bad at IO, so the optimization makes sense, but was never enough of a reason in and of itself to go back and change the code...).  I'd like to think of a way to retain the ability to get this optimization but still simplify the pulling logic.\n\nAs for the other formats like gzip and nothing, they are all legacy formats that some of our segments still use, but very few.  Once we get rid of those, we will be able to clean up that part of the cruft in the code.\n\nThe MMappedQueryableIndexFactory existed to juxtapose an InMemoryQueryableIndexFactory that used to exist, but let fall to the wayside 'cause mmapped operation has been plenty good for us.  It could probably be removed, but it does serve to hide the static call to IndexIO, which I believe is still meaningful...  That whole interaction breaks the DI model, but it's not gonna go away for a while.  More migratory steps are required to clean that bit up, so I'd prefer to have the abstraction layer in there, even if it is practically meaningless.\n\nBtw, how much time are you getting to spend on this?  Some things have occurred internally that are threatening to bump this up on my own priority list of things to do, so I'd like to coordinate that to make sure all toes are intact.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/13412253/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/13439721","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/83#issuecomment-13439721","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/83","id":13439721,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNDM5NzIx","user":{"login":"housejester","id":9088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/housejester","html_url":"https://github.com/housejester","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/housejester/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/housejester/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/housejester/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/housejester/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/housejester/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/housejester/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/housejester/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/housejester/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/housejester/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-02-12T16:06:46Z","updated_at":"2013-02-12T16:06:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the feedback.  I get you on the compression being a data transfer concern.  Looking into adding an hdfs or even LocalFS puller, it was clear to me that I'd be doing a lot of what was in the S3 and S3Zipped Pullers and it seemed like an opportunity to reduce the duplication by moving some of the concerns.  I was really more interested in moving the local-file-caching logic up, but the compression came with it.  As is, you could still handle your own unzipping, and just return the raw unpacked directory to the loader (so you could do your Zip stream with s3 approach and just return the final unpacked directory)…but if that is an optimization that would be useful more broadly, then my commit doesn't really make it much easier :)\n\nIt would be easy enough to add a ZipUtil or even StreamUtil (and that may be the right first step), but it seems like there is another object trying come out.  I was thinking that a SegmentFileCache might make sense or even letting the Segment know about where its files are located.  On Segments knowing the file location, it may not currently fit with Incrementals, but even those could have dirs to flush to and then maybe some of the FireHydrant code could move in?  And Sinks could be a Composite Segments made up of Incrementals?  A bit too foggy for me right now, but thought it worth mentioning.  \n\nWith a SegmentFileCache, the Puller would take the segment and the cache as arguments.  The SegmentFileCache might have helper methods like addSegmentDir(ZipInputStream), and addSegmentDir(File).  The former would be useful for folks that just have zipped pushes and can get the zip stream.  The later would be used by implementations that want/need to do their own deflating: oh, I have snappy tars, i need to decompress and unpack them myself, and call addSegmentDir with my unpacked File Dir.  I suppose it could also have an addDir(Iterable<Tuple<String,InputStream>>) where the Tuple key is the file name, and the Stream is the file.  The Iterable impl might be a bit more involved, but would allow for the least IO because the cache would pull all the streams directly to the final destination instead of starting with a tmp dir which might be on a different volume (and if it is going to yet another remote fs, it could just copy from input stream to output stream and save the disk io altogether).\n\nOn the index factory, I wasn't really thinking nuke the whole abstraction, but instead work toward having IndexIO implement the QueryableIndexFactory interface itself.  With the internal version  map it really does seem like a factory, and that could start to move IndexIO away from statics.  But I can see leaving the other factory and just mentally putting IndexIO into a static helper boat.  I will say I really don't think 'factorize' is a good name for the method :)\n\nI really tried not to drop a wall of text here.  In the end, I'd like to be able have Druid indices stored/loaded from HDFS and a \"local\" File System (where it may be actually pulling from a network drive, which is another reason I think the segment file cache makes sense, because it could ensure the files are pulled to local disk no matter what the remote store is).  I know enough now that I think I could do the pullers without these changes.  I'm happy to just let this be ideas to chew on as you tackle improving the segment store stuff.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/13439721/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/13920573","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/91#issuecomment-13920573","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/91","id":13920573,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzOTIwNTcz","user":{"login":"cheddar","id":216778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjc3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/216778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar","html_url":"https://github.com/cheddar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-02-21T23:49:05Z","updated_at":"2013-02-21T23:49:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This was introduced by the update to the newest version of Jackson.
