this proposal is due largely to serve the goals of the design overhaul. That redesign will require a pretty massive revamp of the existing LESS codebase anyway. This also relates to the cleanup of LESS code we've been working on to move toward a set of variables (a theme, effectively). These efforts combined seem like the best way to\r\n- Have a more homogenous look and feel as we migrate new/updated components to the new design, and\r\n- Isolate the styling concerns of new or restyled components, so they don't bleed to other (older) components\r\n- Allow us to reduce reliance on the LESS codebase, which is built primarily around aging/deprecated libraries. \r\n- Make it exponentially easier to style components in service of the new design direction\r\n\r\nSo, while I don't disagree with your stance about fragmentation, I would suggest that it is the easiest means of migration to the new design system, and it is compatible with the existing setup (LESS still works on any/all components). It will also make styling (and comprehending existing styling) of components easier for future
