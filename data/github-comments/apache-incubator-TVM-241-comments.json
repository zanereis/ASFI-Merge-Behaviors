We can create a `target` with a single dictionary containing the `host` field (the new canonical), or with two `Target`s combined (syntactic sugar I), or with a target string like `cuda --host=llvm` (syntactic sugar II).\r\n\r\nThis design is a solution to keep perfect backward compatibility. In your example, right now, the signature of the build API is:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef build(..., target, target_host...): \r\n```\r\n\r\nTo be compatible with the existing API without breaking them, our refactoring plan is to create a single `target_with_host = Target(target, target_host)`, and proceed with the subsequent workflow with `target_with_host`. This way could work with all the 4 possibilities:\r\n1) `target` contains the `host` field, and `target_host` is None - we use `target.host` as `target_with_host.host`\r\n2) `target` doesn't contain the `host` field, and `target_host` is None - `target_with_host.host` will be None \r\n3) `target` contains the `host` field, and `target_host` is not None - we will error out\r\n4) `target` doesn't contain the `host` field, and `target_host` is not None - `target_with_host.host` will be `target_host`\r\n\r\n> If so, are planning to deprecate one of them?\r\n\r\nSince our solution keeps perfect backward compatibility, we are still deciding whether we really need deprecation at this time point. Even if we finally decided to deprecate the current API and move to a unified target in the function signature, I think we still need to keep it for 2 release cycles so that the community could really get onboard.\r\n\r\n> I noticed there are some syntax changes in this. If this becomes (with this PR) our preferred way to declare the \"target to target host\" dependency, should we also update the tutorials to reflect that?\r\n\r\nYeah.

These attributes worked great until up until calling the compilers. In my use case I need to compile code to use the CPU and Vulkan backends, both of which are built into tvm. With the `compiler_begin/end` annotation it really looks like it only works with external compilers, with no way to use tvm's built in compilers for the second device. For a quick demo I used the older `on_device` annotation which does directly work with both backends built into tvm.\r\n* There is a pass to annotate nodes, `AnnotateDevicePlacement` in `src/relay/transforms/annotate_device_placement.cc`. The pass simply call a callback for each CallNode and then annotates the nodes with the returned `on_device`. This pass is sufficient for the demo I had put together. What the user specifically wants to do is still under investigation.\r\n* As a more long-term goal I agree with you that consolidating the two heterogeneous approaches into a single approach is desired and hope to do that. AnnotateTarget looks to be complete. I though about wrapping CPU and GPU as \"external\" compilers but that seems like a more roundabout solution to the problem, better would be to unify the \"external\" and \"internal\" compilers so that either could be used with the `compile_begin/end` annotation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/782219803/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/782231452","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7478#issuecomment-782231452","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7478","id":782231452,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4MjIzMTQ1Mg==","user":{"login":"leandron","id":437416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzQxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/437416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron","html_url":"https://github.com/leandron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-19T17:46:21Z","updated_at":"2021-02-19T17:46:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"cc @comaniac for a review on this one, when possible\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/782231452/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/782237751","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7428#issuecomment-782237751","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7428","id":782237751,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4MjIzNzc1MQ==","user":{"login":"comaniac","id":8262694,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNjI2OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8262694?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac","html_url":"https://github.com/comaniac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-19T17:57:05Z","updated_at":"2021-02-19T17:57:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rkimball Exactly.

If we do like this, how do we handle this exception? continue or abort or whatever. Another thing is how do we add the counter elegantly. When we recursive call in the rewrite simplifier, we in fact analyze the whole expr and then recusive calling VisitExpr. If we want to record cnt, must we add in the `class ExprFunctor`'s `VisitExpr`?

enough.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/783134102/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/783173932","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7490#issuecomment-783173932","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7490","id":783173932,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4MzE3MzkzMg==","user":{"login":"monklof","id":2393551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzOTM1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2393551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/monklof","html_url":"https://github.com/monklof","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monklof/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monklof/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monklof/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monklof/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monklof/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monklof/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monklof/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monklof/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monklof/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-22T08:01:23Z","updated_at":"2021-02-22T08:01:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@kevinthesun

Like TRT, we have function called as `reportLayerTime` to do it but we don't have to use one version like Debug TRT. (see https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT/blob/master/samples/opensource/sampleNMT/sampleNMT.cpp#L1127). \r\n\r\nOf course, we don't have to create one class named as Profiler in TRT to do this.
