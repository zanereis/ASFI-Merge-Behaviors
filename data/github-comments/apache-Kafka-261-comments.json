agree that moving the BufferSupplier to the Fetcher is ultimately the right thing to do, but it feels like we're going through great lengths to avoid ThreadLocals when we are already indirectly making use of them in the Snappy case, through [`SnappyOutputStream`'s default `BufferAllocator`](https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/blob/master/src/main/java/org/xerial/snappy/buffer/CachedBufferAllocator.java).\r\n\r\nThe server side could equally benefit from the performance improvements during compaction.\r\n\r\nWould it be ok to wait for a more comprehensive solution to removing the ThreadLocals on both server and client side across all compression schemes? I feel we are unnecessarily picking on the LZ4 case, and unless there are real concerns with introducing ThreadLocal's on the consumer side, I don't feel we have a good reason not to do so.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, all the other small changes in the PR look good to

the second link is for a different pure Java Snappy library that we don't use. So, to be clear, we are not currently relying on thread locals. There are pros and cons for thread local versus global caches, but let's leave that discussion for another time. :)\r\n\r\nWith regards to the path forward for the 0.11.0.0 release, I think it makes sense to go with the lowest risk solution that gives us the huge gains you outlined in your PR. From that perspective, I think it's actually a benefit that this version doesn't affect the broker. By limiting this to the `Fetcher` and via a `BufferSupplier` that has the same lifecycle as `Fetcher`,  it reduces the risk.\r\n\r\nI agree that there are a number of improvements we can do in the broker for reducing buffer allocation costs and we should pursue those for the next release (along with KIP-72).\r\n\r\nThoughts?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/304982554/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/304987624","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/3012#issuecomment-304987624","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/3012","id":304987624,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNDk4NzYyNA==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-30T19:47:25Z","updated_at":"2017-05-30T19:47:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nRefer

quick update: \r\n\r\nThe tests have revealed a bug: The `TxnOffsetCommitResponse` could have a `REQUEST_TIMED_OUT` error, which is retriable. The client did not handle this as a retriable error but instead considered it fatal and put the transaction manager in error state. \r\n\r\nThe `TransactionalMessageCopier` would then get a `KafkaException` on the next transactional method it invoked. It would catch this exception, and log it to stderr, and exit. So the copy process would never finish. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, due to an oversight in the python test code, we never collected the stderr stream from the message copier, so there was nothing suspicious in the logs collected. I only found this out because _very occasionally_ the background sender thread would run _before_ the process was shut down, detect that the transaction manager is in error state, and log it. Since we collected the transactional_message_copier logs (ie. the actual producer logs), I could get alerted to this issue .\r\n\r\nI have now updated the code to both handle the REQUEST_TIMED_OUT error on the TxnOffsetCommitRequest (just like the `ConsumerCoordinator` does for the regular `OffsetCommitRequest`), and also collect the stderr log from the `TransactionalMessageCopier`. My testing so far shows that the test is stable after these changes.
