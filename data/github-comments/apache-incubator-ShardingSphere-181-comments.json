@ThanoshanMV ,\r\n\r\nSince `merge` is a new SQL type, we plan to create a `merge.xml`, right?

I am not sure whether you ever tried it, but we can start with `imitation`.  :-)\r\n\r\nHere are some steps for your consideration,\r\n- Add `@XmlElement(name = \"merge\")` to `SQLParserTestCases`\r\n- Create `MergeStatementTestCase` referring to other `xxxStatementTestCase` in that file (`SelectStatementTestCase` is a good one)\r\n- No need to fill all the elements in `MergeStatementTestCase` once.

found a similar problem when PR integration test, e.g. `Integration Test / MySQL-Proxy with DB`, part of error output:\r\n```\r\nError:  assertExecute[proxy: db -> MySQL -> Placeholder -> SELECT SUM(DISTINCT order_id) FROM t_order WHERE order_id < 1100](org.apache.shardingsphere.test.integration.engine.it.dql.GeneralDQLIT)  Time elapsed: 0.007 s  <<< FAILURE!\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: \r\nSize of actual result set is different with size of expected dat set rows.\r\nExpected: is <1>\r\n     but: was <0>\r\n```\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce on local environment:\r\n\r\n1, Prepare configurations for proxy, copy config files from `shardingsphere-integration-test-suite/src/test/resrouces/docker/db/proxy/conf/` into `shardingsphere-proxy-bootstrap/src/main/resources/`\r\n- copy `config-db.yaml` into `config-sharding.yaml`\r\n- copy `server.yaml` into `server.yaml`\r\n\r\n2, Update `shardingsphere-integration-test-suite/src/test/resources/env/engine-env.properties`\r\n```\r\nit.adapters=proxy\r\n\r\n#it.scenarios=db,tbl,dbtbl_with_replica_query,replica_query,shadow\r\nit.scenarios=db\r\n\r\n#it.databases=H2,MySQL,Oracle,SQLServer,PostgreSQL\r\nit.databases=MySQL\r\n```\r\n\r\nUpdate `shardingsphere-integration-test-suite/src/test/resources/env/db/scenario-env.properties`, `mysql` and `proxy` related configuration, e.g.\r\n```\r\nit.db.mysql.host=127.0.0.1\r\nit.db.mysql.port=3306\r\nit.db.mysql.username=root\r\nit.db.mysql.password=\r\n\r\nit.db.proxy.host=127.0.0.1\r\nit.db.proxy.port=3307\r\n```\r\n\r\n3, Copy `org.apache.shardingsphere.proxy.Bootstrap.java` to `shardingsphere-integration-test-suite` as `ProxyBootstrapTest.java`, since `STANDARD_TEST` in `config-db.yaml` is a customized algorithm that is implemented in unit test\r\n\r\n4, Run `ProxyBootstrapTest.java`\r\n\r\n5, Prepare  an test client and start it, e.g. `TempTest.java`\r\n```\r\npublic class TempTest {\r\n    \r\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {\r\n        String sql;\r\n        sql = \"SELECT SUM(DISTINCT order_id) s FROM t_order WHERE order_id < 1100\"; // result missed in response\r\n//        sql = \"SELECT SUM(order_id) s FROM t_order WHERE order_id < 1100\"; //ok\r\n//        sql = \"SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) s FROM t_order WHERE order_id < 1100\"; //ok\r\n        String jdbcUrl = \"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3307/db?useServerPrepStmts=true&serverTimezone=UTC&useSSL=false&useLocalSessionState=true&characterEncoding=utf-8\";\r\n        try (Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(jdbcUrl, \"root\", \"root\");\r\n             PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement(sql)) {\r\n            try (ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery()) {\r\n                while (resultSet.next()) {\r\n                    System.out.println(\"c1=\" + resultSet.getString(1));\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n6, Run `GeneralDQLIT.java` to verify all test cases\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/768224083/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/768289981","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/9127#issuecomment-768289981","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/9127","id":768289981,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2ODI4OTk4MQ==","user":{"login":"tuohai666","id":24643893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjQzODkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24643893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666","html_url":"https://github.com/tuohai666","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-27T13:36:59Z","updated_at":"2021-01-27T13:36:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Got

If the table doesn't exist, I don't want to throw an exception, I hope it can customize an empty collection to return.\r\n\r\nFor example I have these tables: ```order2020-02```, ```order2020-03```\r\n\r\ni didn't know the table(order2020-01) didn't exist , and i execute\r\n``` java\r\nList<Order> orderList = SqlClient.eval(\"SELECT * FROM order WHERE month IN('2020-01', '2020-02', '2020-03')\");\r\n```\r\nI will get an table not exist exception, if I want to convert this exception to a custom return, i need to do\r\n``` java\r\nList<Order> orderList = new ArrayList<>();\r\ntry {\r\n    List<Order> month1 = SqlClient.eval(\"SELECT * FROM order WHERE month = '2020-01'\");\r\n    orderList.addAll(month1);\r\n} catch (Exception e) {\r\n    // ignore this exception, add nothing to orderList\r\n}\r\n\r\ntry {\r\n    List<Order> month2 = SqlClient.eval(\"SELECT * FROM order WHERE month = '2020-02'\");\r\n    orderList.addAll(month2);\r\n} catch (Exception e) {\r\n    // ignore this exception, add nothing to orderList\r\n}\r\n\r\ntry {\r\n    List<Order> month3 = SqlClient.eval(\"SELECT * FROM order WHERE month = '2020-03'\");\r\n    orderList.addAll(month3);\r\n} catch (Exception e) {\r\n    // ignore this exception, add nothing to orderList\r\n}\r\n```\r\n It seems too much trouble,  is there a simple way to deal with it ?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/770563906/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/770610713","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/9218#issuecomment-770610713","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/9218","id":770610713,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MDYxMDcxMw==","user":{"login":"fengchao-GitHub","id":64132316,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MTMyMzE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64132316?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengchao-GitHub","html_url":"https://github.com/fengchao-GitHub","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengchao-GitHub/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengchao-GitHub/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengchao-GitHub/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengchao-GitHub/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengchao-GitHub/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengchao-GitHub/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengchao-GitHub/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengchao-GitHub/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengchao-GitHub/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-01T06:38:34Z","updated_at":"2021-02-01T06:38:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"yes it is a table in database 'information_schema' \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64132316/106423304-25187380-649b-11eb-985f-3d5441f35428.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/770610713/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/770617637","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/9228#issuecomment-770617637","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/9228","id":770617637,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MDYxNzYzNw==","user":{"login":"AI1186780944","id":40418583,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNDE4NTgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40418583?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AI1186780944","html_url":"https://github.com/AI1186780944","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AI1186780944/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AI1186780944/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AI1186780944/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AI1186780944/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AI1186780944/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AI1186780944/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AI1186780944/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AI1186780944/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AI1186780944/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-01T06:52:07Z","updated_at":"2021-02-01T06:52:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @tristaZero \r\nThanks for your feedback. The configuration doesn't work.Your code implementation logic doesn't support this kind of collocation.The reason is that there are two data sources:\"encrypydatasource\" and \"masterslavedatasource\".They are created by two DataSourceFactory.Because there are two DataSourceFactory, two transaction managers are generated. This will make the spring container not know which TransactionManager to register, resulting in an error.Moreover, EncrypyDatasourceFactoryand MasterSlavedDatasourceFactory do not provide an interface that allows users to specify transaction managers freely.\r\nYour version of 5.0.0-alpha is supported.Because the data source type accepted by this data source factory is map type.I can create my various configuration rules and data sources in the same factory.
