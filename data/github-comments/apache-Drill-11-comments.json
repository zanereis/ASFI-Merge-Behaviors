In the scenario addressed by this fix, there is a const integer that came from the SQL select where clause, and that is what is being casted into a decimal, for comparison with each a decimal value in each row.   Since the integer is constant, a thoroughly optimized piece of code would cast it just once to a decimal, and use the stored decimal to compare with the decimal value in each row.  It appears that that is not what this code is doing. It is casting repeatedly, for each row.  So, rather than be concerned with just a few added integer divisions by 10 (a small number around log10(the const integer) + 1 divides), this code should ideally be (more) extensively modified to do the cast operation just once.  That's too big a change for me to make for this fix.  Besides, which is preferable?  Code that does not function properly (DRILL-4704), and is not well optimized?  Or code that behaves correctly, and is only slightly less well optimized?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/232475873/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/232531015","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/540#issuecomment-232531015","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/540","id":232531015,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMjUzMTAxNQ==","user":{"login":"parthchandra","id":6529136,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MjkxMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6529136?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra","html_url":"https://github.com/parthchandra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-14T01:14:51Z","updated_at":"2016-07-14T01:14:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Can you log a new JIRA to investigate and address issues with any other column types?\n+1 for this change.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/232531015/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/232788940","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/518#issuecomment-232788940","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/518","id":232788940,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMjc4ODk0MA==","user":{"login":"chunhui-shi","id":9878787,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4Nzg3ODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9878787?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chunhui-shi","html_url":"https://github.com/chunhui-shi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chunhui-shi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chunhui-shi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chunhui-shi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chunhui-shi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chunhui-shi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chunhui-shi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chunhui-shi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chunhui-shi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chunhui-shi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-14T20:52:44Z","updated_at":"2016-07-14T20:52:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for providing a way to skip bad json records and addressing my comments.\nBesides the minor improvements I suggested above: comment format changes that may be due to line width in your env.,  and unit tests that should check the expected output as much as possible, could you please squash these multiple commits into one commit?

While I do understand this is not the default behavior, I think there is still too high of a risk that an admin could set this at a global level and users would be unaware of some of their data being discarded.\n\n~~I am willing to discuss the benefits of merging this before such a system exists, but until this issue has been thoroughly evaluated I am -1 on the change.~~\nChanging to a +0 for reasons stated below.\n\nOne improvement you could make to the current implementation is moving the option to the format plugin instead of the system/session list. This enables users to include setting the option in there query with the \"table with options\" syntax that was added last fall. We already have a JIRA open for moving the all_text_mode and read_numbers_as_double options to this location, because it doesn't really make sense to change query results based on session state. Unfortunately this change does not completely remove my initial concern, because not all users can modify or see the storage plugins in the case when web UI security is enabled.

original behavior was not by design, it was a bug. I would just detect the case where a scalar is being flattened and throw an appropriate user facing message like \"Flatten does not support inputs of non-list values\".\n\nThe tests you have included here don't check their results. I would also suggest adding a test for the new negative case, checking for the appropriate message.\n\nIf you want to more precisely control the input to your test, I would recommend taking a look at the operator unit test system I checked in and demonstrated at the hangout last month. This will allow you to write more targeted tests for this case.

Vitalii said:\n\n> I checked every schema#getTable and found that every method can throw exception only if something go wrong (permissionError, dataReadError, IOException etc). \n> getTableFromSchema()can not throw any exception, because in this method catch (Exception e) is used.\n\nCorrect, `catch(Exception e)` is used, but the exception is wrapped in a `DrillRuntimeException` and re-thrown.\n\nI think it \"happens so\" that all plugins are doing the right thing. To explain myself, there are two cases that I am concerned about:\n1.  `getTableFromSchema` (and underlying `schema#getTable`) throws an exception when a table does not exist. For example, if the HBase plugin supports dropping tables in the future, an invalid table name will cause the query to [fail with](https://github.com/apache/drill/blob/master/contrib/storage-hbase/src/main/java/org/apache/drill/exec/store/hbase/DrillHBaseTable.java#L42) a `TableNotFoundException`, which is exactly the case an exception should not thrown, if `IF EXISTS` exists.  _For now,_ since hbase schema is not mutable, the [check for schema mutability](https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/541/files#diff-50862f72c560b2d1bd9af36e83019d80R66), before deleting the table, fails.\n2. `getTableFromSchema` (and underlying `schema#getTable`) does not return `null` for non-existent tables, and `schema#dropTable` will fail. _For now_, only two schema support dropping tables: `WorkspaceSchema` and `KuduTables`, and they return `null` for non-existent tables. The check for schema mutability fails for other schema.\n\nOverall, it seems there is an unwritten rule (`schema#getTable` should return `null` if the table does not exist) that should be documented, and HBase plugin should be fixed. AFAIK other plugins follow this rule.\n\n+1 for the changes; I think we should track these above issues in another ticket.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/234414446/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/234419286","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/502#issuecomment-234419286","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/502","id":234419286,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNDQxOTI4Ng==","user":{"login":"sudheeshkatkam","id":3272600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNzI2MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3272600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam","html_url":"https://github.com/sudheeshkatkam","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-21T23:59:37Z","updated_at":"2016-07-21T23:59:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jcmote

We should fix place where scale/precision is specified wrongly.

As others have noted, the code is passing through lines 316-316. My guess is that the materializer is working out how to call this function:\n\nDecimal28SparseFunctions.Decimal28SparseEqual( Decimal28Sparse left, Decimal28Sparse right )\nThe materializer sees: D28SEqual( Decimal28Sparse, Integer )\n\nThe code wants to convert the Integer to a Decimal28Sparse. It asks the argument for its precision and scale. But, since the argument just specifies the \"minor type\" (SQL type), it does not have the extended attributes of precision and scale. Thus, the annotations in the function definition are the ultimate cause of the precision being 0:\n\n@Param Decimal28SparseHolder left;\n@Param Decimal28SparseHolder right;\n\nNow, we might argue that the code should be using, as the target (p, s) the (p,s) of the left argument (the one that is already a decimal). But, the materializer does not know that this is an operator; it treats all functions the same (operators and otherwise.) So, the materializer does not know that we should treat arguments in this way. All it knows is that it has an Integer and wants a D28S (of, presumably, any p & s).\n\nNext, we can ask how DS28Equal handles the (p,s) of the two arguments: must they be the same or can they be different? Looking at the code (as best as I can tell), the code will align values with different (p,s) values. Thus, say, values of Decimal28( 10, 2 ) and Decimal28( 8, 0 ) will compare properly.\n\nSo, back to the cast from Integer to D28S. As Dave suggests, we can interpret (precision == 0) to mean \"you figure it out\": we can set (p,s) way we want.\n\nDave's fix computes the precision based on the actual integer value. But, since the comparison can handle any valid (p,s), we might as well set them to a constant. Since the maximum Integer value is 2 billion, we can just use a constant (10,0).\n\nIf the selected precision is constant, then the cost is low and the solution is fine for both for constant integers (as in the original case), and for per-row conversions (as in Aman's concern.)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/237725295/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/237733114","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/517#issuecomment-237733114","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/517","id":237733114,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNzczMzExNA==","user":{"login":"paul-rogers","id":3248881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDg4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3248881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers","html_url":"https://github.com/paul-rogers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-05T01:31:14Z","updated_at":"2016-08-05T01:31:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The plot thickens.

The template in question generates cast functions for (INTEGER, BIGINT) x (DECIMAL9, DECIMAL18, DECIMAL28) and perhaps others. The constant of 10 does not, of course, work for BIGINT (long) values.\n\nThe trick is that precision=10 won't work for DECIMAL9 either. Dave's solution has a similar problem. Dave sets the precision to whatever is right for the input value, which seems great. But, that value could be too large for the output DECIMAL type.\n\nWhat we need is to set the precision to the min( max int precision, max decimal precision ). Or, if we use Dave's proposed solution, max( input arg precision, max decimal precision ).\n\nIn either case, the code must handle overflow. Passing a Long.MAX_VALUE or even Integer.MAX_VALUE to CastBigIntDecimal9( ) should cause an overflow error or data truncation.
