Re-distributing it does certainly not work.\r\n\r\nTo my current understanding, the Apache guidelines say we would need to make sure that downstream consumers of Flink (also the source) don't accidentally pull in a GPL license. For weak copyleft, where consuming it only via linking, it is okay, but for strong copyleft, where accidentally linking it results in copyleft, I think the hurdles for that are pretty high. There are some gray zone areas (like MPL) where the understanding is that \"optional\" dependency is okay because it requires an explicit action by a downstream user (re-adding the dependency) and the potential damage is not too high.\r\n\r\nI have seen a lot of cases first hand in the past months how many companies that want to use open source freak out as soon as they see an instance of GPL. We would make Flink's adoption easier if we did not have that.\r\n\r\nMy first suggestion would be to consolidate this in a separate `flink-benchmarks` repository. That would also keep the core Flink repository \"clear\" of GPL.

aggregateFunction,\r\n\t\t\tWindowAssigner<? super IN, W> windowAssigner)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt adds a final aggregation step as well. With version that you proposed user would have to implement two slightly different `windowAssigner` and `aggregationFunction` for both the pre aggregation and final aggregation step. This could lead to a confusion and mistakes. Those functions have to be different because assigning windows, creating accumulators and accumulating happens only in the pre aggregation step and it works on `INPUT` data type, while in final aggregation we are working on a `Tuple3<KEY, WINDOW, ACCUMULATOR>` and we perform only merging of already created windows and accumulators.

a comment on the use of `TypeHint`:\r\n\r\nIn the `DataSet` and `DataStream` API, we typically pass `TypeInformation` when offering an explicit way to describe the type.

In some way, one could always use `new TypeHint<Tuple2<Long, String>>(){}.getTypeInfo()`, but for convenience, some methods accept directly a `TypeHint`, mainly the `returns(...)` method.\r\n\r\nIf you take `TypeHint` directly as a parameter, it becomes hard to pass the type if you for example obtain it from another `DataSet` via the `getType()` method.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/352087405/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/352088079","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/5133#issuecomment-352088079","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/5133","id":352088079,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MjA4ODA3OQ==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-15T19:13:29Z","updated_at":"2017-12-15T19:13:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think this is good, except for the removal of `StandaloneHaServices#RESOURCE_MANAGER_RPC_ENDPOINT_NAME` where I am unsure if some of the pending FLIP-6 work has plans for that.
