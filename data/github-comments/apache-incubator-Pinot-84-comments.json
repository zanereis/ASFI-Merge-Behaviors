Another small benefit of not loading the empty segment is that we can remove the `ValidSegmentPruner` and reduce the query overhead a little bit.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/777040075/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/777190471","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/6466#issuecomment-777190471","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/6466","id":777190471,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3NzE5MDQ3MQ==","user":{"login":"npawar","id":19693933,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjkzOTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19693933?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar","html_url":"https://github.com/npawar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-11T04:05:58Z","updated_at":"2021-02-11T04:05:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Discussed offline and seems allowing empty index segment is easier to manage.

Because we use the map size as threshold, we should multiply it by the load factor. There is no performance impact.\r\n\r\nDiscussed offline with @Jackie-Jiang  to clarify this. The difference between this and standard Java hashmap is that in the latter we provide initial capacity and the load factor as the input and then load factor is used to compute the threshold size (expected size) after which resize is triggered.\r\n\r\nHowever, in case of Int2IntOpenHashMap, the expected size should be provided as the input. That's the reason to use the load factor as the multipler.

\r\n>Would you want all partitions of the stream to pause , or just some specific partitions??\r\n\r\nFor all partitions. The consumption for the table itself should be stopped. I was thinking something like this. \r\n1. User pauses stream -> pinot server commits the current consuming segments(for all partitions) along with offsets. \r\n2. User resumes stream -> Pinot starts consumption from all partitions from previously committed offsets. \r\n\r\n>Would you want all partitions/tables in a given server to pause?\r\n\r\nI was expecting the pause option to be at a table level. Because of this #6555 . If the pause and reset APIs are available at a table level, then the user can pause the current stream(which would commit current segments and pause the stream), reset the offsets, and resume consumption  from earliest/latest offsets as per config. \r\n\r\n>After a pause, if the server is restarted, how do you desire the server should come back up? Should it consume up to the exact same paused place again? Should it simply not consume after the last completed/committed point? Should it forget that it was paused?\r\n\r\nIf a table is paused and server restarts after it, then considering the previous consuming segments were already committed when the table is paused, I would expect the server to not consume after the restart too. My understanding is when we pause the stream, we are changing the state of the table and it should not start consuming until the user resumes the stream himself. \r\n\r\n>Further if there are multiple replicas, do you want them all to pause at the same place after a pause command?\r\n\r\nYes. That's what I would expect when I pause the stream. No replica of any partition consumer should be active is what I feel. \r\n\r\nPS: Just putting it out here. When we pause the table, the table should still be available for querying the already consumed data. If not, this would be more or less like the enable/disable API.
