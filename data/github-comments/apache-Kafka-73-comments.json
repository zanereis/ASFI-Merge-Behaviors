The same metrics object are used across all threads within a KafkaStreams instance, and since the sensors are created with the same sensor name, they are technically shared among all the threads as well. So with multiple threads it could cause contention. How many threads are you using per-instance in your profiling experiment?\n\nOkay since the overhead seems not mainly from `time.nanoseconds`, I will change it back from `milliseconds` as it provides more accurate metrics. And I will probably leave the other optimizations in this ticket.\n\nTwo open questions I'd like to hear everyone's opinions @enothereska @mjsax @dguy @junrao @ijuma @jkreps regarding to further optimize metrics recording in Kafka Streams:\n1. Before Streams we usually only have one thread per each client (think of producer and consumer), and hence no contention will ever happen. For Kafka Streams we have configurable number of background threads, but originally I still want to keep the metric sensors to be at the per-instance level instead of per-thread level, since the latter case may be cumbersome for users to monitor and alert on. However we will incur concurrent contention on the shared sensor objects. \n\nSo should we consider 1) removing the `synchronized` block on the Sensor, and just making sure that there will be no concurrent access modifying the same data structure (think of `add` and `record` calls), or 2) fall back to per-thread metrics reporting, or 3) just bite the bullet of contention for per-instance metrics reporting.\n1. An semi-related question is, whether or not we should record metrics on each record. Remember in other clients since we do batching on request / responses, we are batching on metrics recording naturally. For Kafka Streams where we do one-record-at-a-time, should we consider 1) sampling on metrics recording (i.e. only record per every x records), or 2) batching and taking average metrics (i.e. accumulate values every x records, and record only once taking the average).

I think the right solution for an issue like this would be to collect per thread metrics and then aggregate them periodically (ignoring sampling for now). Even without a lock, the cache effects of mutating shared variables often from multiple threads won't be pretty.\n\nBefore spending a lot of time on this, it's probably a good idea to verify what is the best case scenario we can achieve without sampling. We could first switch to per thread metrics and measure the impact. And we could then remove synchronization from `Sensor` (even though it makes it thread unsafe) and measure again. Adding per-instance aggregated metrics and some form of thread-safety would introduce some overhead, so the above would give us an idea if this is good enough or if we need to go down the sampling route.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/226412979/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/226414740","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1512#issuecomment-226414740","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1512","id":226414740,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNjQxNDc0MA==","user":{"login":"mangas","id":1640325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDAzMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1640325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mangas","html_url":"https://github.com/mangas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mangas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mangas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mangas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mangas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mangas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mangas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mangas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mangas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mangas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-16T07:59:01Z","updated_at":"2016-06-16T07:59:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ijuma

Metric collection should be as low overhead as possible, so we don't want to be introducing contention, locks etc. Also, users can also aggregate the per thread metrics if we don't do it. In some respects it is much better to get the raw values rather than averages of averages of averages.\n\nAs for the last point regarding batching, i don't really like it. I see the point of reducing the overhead, but we now have an average, that will be rolled up into another average. Data points are lost. But i get there is likely a tradeoff here\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/226578993/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/226580849","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1472#issuecomment-226580849","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1472","id":226580849,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNjU4MDg0OQ==","user":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-16T18:58:57Z","updated_at":"2016-06-16T18:58:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM.
