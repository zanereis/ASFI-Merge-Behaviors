We think there is an option which would not force an upgrade while keeping Hoodie OSS clean. \r\n\r\nThe idea is to have Komondor identify the file-Ids where new records are inserted and force a future compaction by creating an empty log file before we commit. Once, all the clients have eventually upgraded to latest jars, we can remove this from Komondor. \r\n\r\nCurrently HoodieIOHandles do not track \"inserts during merging/compacting\" (but we track updates and deletes). This is a good metric to be added to Hoodie (in HoodieMergeHandle.close() and also in HoodieCreateHandle). Komondor can inspect this metric from WriteStatusRDD returned by upsert and create empty log-files for those HoodieWriteStats whose path points to parquet and insertsDuringMerge > 0. This needs to be done only for ingestion path and not for async compaction.\r\n\r\nIf the commit gets rollback, the rollback logic should remove the empty log-file along with the parquet file.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/405796894/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/405808362","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/424#issuecomment-405808362","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/424","id":405808362,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNTgwODM2Mg==","user":{"login":"n3nash","id":2722167,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MjIxNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2722167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash","html_url":"https://github.com/n3nash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-18T04:52:57Z","updated_at":"2018-07-18T04:54:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bvaradar @vinothchandar That's also an alternative option. Although, this option seems much more complex and laced with scope for bugs with custom handling of creation of log files, rollback etc on the client. I would rather avoid such complex logic to lie in ingestion jobs making reasoning of code difficult. \r\nI agree with tracking inserts during merging/compacting in HoodieMergeHandle. \r\nI propose the following : \r\nLet's further think about \"Force a dummy compaction for such file ids\" option that I mentioned above and see if there are any obvious problems.

At the moment, you can use the HoodieReadClient.filterExists() to check for uniqueness with same `HoodieKey` and that way dedup all hoodie records with an already present hoodie key. But again, HoodieKey ] {UUID, partitionpath} so if you have the same UUID with different partition paths this will not work. You will need to \"tag\" the UUID with the same partition path.
