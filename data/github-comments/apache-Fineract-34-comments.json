Do we need to goto tomcat 10? @ptuomola , @vorburger\r\n\r\nWe don't \"need\" to, no. Eventually it could be nice to, just because over time we want to \"keep up\".\r\n\r\nBut seeing that it doesn't \"just work\" (build log: `> Task :integration-tests:cargoStartLocal org.codehaus.cargo.container.ContainerException: Deployable [https://localhost:8443/cargocpc/index.html] failed to finish deploying within the timeout period [240000]. The Deployable state is thus unknown.`), I suggest that we Close and Ignore this, for now - just because we have _\"bigger fish to fry\"_.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/754097993/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/754098739","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/1557#issuecomment-754098739","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/1557","id":754098739,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1NDA5ODczOQ==","user":{"login":"forking-renovate[bot]","id":34481203,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MzQ0ODEyMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/7402?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/forking-renovate%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/forking-renovate","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forking-renovate%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forking-renovate%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forking-renovate%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forking-renovate%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forking-renovate%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forking-renovate%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forking-renovate%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forking-renovate%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forking-renovate%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-04T17:10:22Z","updated_at":"2022-03-05T13:10:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Renovate Ignore Notification\n\nAs this PR has been closed unmerged, Renovate will ignore this upgrade and you will not receive PRs for *any* future 10.x releases.
