But AutoTVM does not support this kind of space definition.\r\n\r\nThere are some knobs for tiling in the search space. However, they are dependent on tile size. For example, in the arm cpu's schedule, https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/36702a7678573fa4ff9ea04c3920e60d590496c9/topi/python/topi/arm_cpu/conv2d.py#L390-L392. `P` is the number of winograd tiles.

We construct the split knob according to the lengths of P, so different tile sizes will have different spaces.\r\n\r\nCurrently, AutoTVM does not support dependent relationships between tuning knobs. What it does is picking the first candidate of tile size (which is 2 according to your construction) and initializing other knobs. In the above case, it will enumerate all split schemes for P = 784.

We construct the split knob according to the lengths of P, so different tile sizes will have different spaces.\r\n\r\n* I also found this correlation and dependency to P in case of our arm/mali.\r\n\r\n* Yes i agree, that is also my finding during tests regarding P. Would be great help me elaborate an exact relationship ```tile_size -> P``` . Otherwise, if we don't narrow down the possible lists,  we just can enumerate bulk ```range(0,256)``` for some of knob's there and let xgb find it out but it wold have to search in 10e+7 cfg.space than.\r\n\r\n* Again, as fact, even ignoring this dependency for now we are still better than existing formula.\r\n* In fact, for now, solutions with  this knob will be 2 or 4 (very rare 3 hits) in most cases.\r\n\r\n> Currently, AutoTVM does not support dependent relationships between tuning knobs. What it does is picking the first candidate of tile size (which is 2 according to your construction) and initializing other knobs. In the above case, it will enumerate all split schemes for P = 784. But some split schemes for P = 784 are invalid for P = 196, which will cause the AutoTVM hangs forever during feature extraction.\r\n\r\n* So, could help me find the relation of P given tile_size ?\r\n\r\n> \r\n> ### Ideal solution\r\n> Support hierarchical space definition in AutoTVM\r\n> \r\n> ### Workaround\r\n> 1. Fix the feature extraction. We hang on this line https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/11da1ca31b8121e9a40c70f33ade27670d22e2d0/python/tvm/autotvm/tuner/xgboost_cost_model.py#L311\r\n>     because we get exceptions when running this function https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/11da1ca31b8121e9a40c70f33ade27670d22e2d0/python/tvm/autotvm/tuner/xgboost_cost_model.py#L328\r\n> 2. Use `feature_type` = `knob` in the XGBTuner. I won't merge this solution to master.\r\n\r\n* OK, i put xgb issue on higher pripority, it is trigerred 100% on such scenarios like #2111 \r\n\r\n> \r\n> You don't meet the problem when tuning for CUDA and mali because I added some restrictions to their schedule templates and luckily they work around this problem. But for arm cpu we will meet this problem.\r\n\r\n* Where are those restrictions exactly ?\r\n\r\n> \r\n> Let me know if you want to try to fix it or want more information from me. Otherwise, I can fix it later.\r\n\r\nYes i give it a try to fix it, I'll update you on progress.\r\n\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nTo sum up lets settle for now the order :\r\n\r\n0. For now, as mentioned & tested,  our PR is still **better** than existing ```two cased conditional```. \r\n1. Try find xgb fea issue and repair it.\r\n2. Lets see a smarter P given tile_size (please help me elaborate a generating formula).\r\n3. If get ```tile_size->P``` we can try introduce hierarchical knob mode (i have an simple idea for that).\r\n\r\n\r\nArguing by point 0. , the PR would be mergeable, otherwise we transform this PR in a long multi PR.\r\nAgree 1 +  2 + 3 are mandatory, i would help tackle each in upcoming another 3 PR (there will be too much debate if we keep in a single PR like this one).\r\n\r\nWhat do you think ?\r\n\r\n----------","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/516885988/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/516900003","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/3642#issuecomment-516900003","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3642","id":516900003,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNjkwMDAwMw==","user":{"login":"cbalint13","id":3974360,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzQzNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3974360?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13","html_url":"https://github.com/cbalint13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-31T15:30:02Z","updated_at":"2019-07-31T15:30:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Opened a [disscuss topic](https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/winograd-variable-tile-size-knob/3565) and started first with ```xgb``` & ```hierarchical knob``` issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/516900003/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/516901882","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/3671#issuecomment-516901882","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3671","id":516901882,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNjkwMTg4Mg==","user":{"login":"abergeron","id":1002504,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDI1MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1002504?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron","html_url":"https://github.com/abergeron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-31T15:34:15Z","updated_at":"2019-07-31T15:34:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The test that failed was for batch norm layer.

For MaxPooling, as we are selecting out the max value among uint8, the selecting doesn't introduce zero point change. For AveragePooling, we will accumulate in int32, and the accumulated zero point can be easily reduced in division operation.\r\n\r\nYou may check [TFLite code](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/v2.0.0-beta1/tensorflow/lite/kernels/internal/reference/integer_ops/pooling.h#L81-L136) if you are interested. (I don't mean to enforce TFLite implementation, but the reasoning above.)\r\n\r\nTo summarize, in general, if the zero point won't shift in the computing, it can be safely ignored.

In our previous practice, if they are known statically, we would prefer to put them into Attrs. However, in this PR, we bypass type relation and use pre-defined shape function that could be lowered to LLVM to do code generation.\r\n\r\nJust saying, will it be possible if we have some mechanism to put those scalars back to Attrs so that we can reuse previous efforts in defining TypeRelation?\r\n\r\nFor example, imagine we have primitive types in Relay, then we allow one operator to produce tvm::Array<tvm::Integer> as output.
