Cloud (formerly SonarCloud) is a SaaS code analysis tool designed to detect coding issues in 30+ languages, frameworks, and IaC platforms.Your code is checked against an extensive set of rules that cover many attributes of code, such as maintainability, reliability, and security issues, on each merge/pull request.\r\n\r\nSonarQube Cloud integrates seamlessly into your GitHub workflow and provides clear guidance for resolving any code quality and security issues detected. The majority of popular languages can be analyzed automatically; no configuration is required!\r\n\r\nWith [SonarQube Cloud](https://sonarcloud.io/github), you get:\r\n\r\n-   Fast, precise static analysis and feedback on your code\r\n    \r\n-   Support for popular languages, frameworks, and IaC tools\r\n    \r\n-   Free analysis for open-source projects and private projects up to max 50k LoC\r\n    \r\n-   Automatic analysis of pull requests and branches with results reported inline\r\n    \r\n-   IDE Support with [SonarQube for IDE](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarlint/) integration\r\n    \r\n-   Quality Gate (added as a GitHub check) acting at two different levels - first, preventing you from merging pull requests that contain issues - and later, helping you to release only clean, safe code\r\n    \r\n-   Sign up for SonarQube free tier and begin scanning your private and public repositories\r\n    \r\n\r\nA [GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/sonarcloud-scan) is available in the marketplace to make it easy for you (for projects where automatic analysis isn't available). SonarQube Cloud also integrates smoothly with Jenkins, CircleCI, TravisCI, CirrusCI, and many other tools.\r\n\r\nA free tier is available that allows you to explore the benefits of SonarQube Cloud using your public and private repositories. We also provide a no-commitment, [14-day trial](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarcloud/signup/) of SonarQube Cloud Team for unlimited team members, up to 1.9M LoC, AI CodeFix recommendations, and more.

Cloud (formerly SonarCloud) is a SaaS code analysis tool designed to detect coding issues in 30+ languages, frameworks, and IaC platforms.Your code is checked against an extensive set of rules that cover many attributes of code, such as maintainability, reliability, and security issues, on each merge/pull request.\r\n\r\nSonarQube Cloud integrates seamlessly into your GitHub workflow and provides clear guidance for resolving any code quality and security issues detected. The majority of popular languages can be analyzed automatically; no configuration is required!\r\n\r\nWith [SonarQube Cloud](https://sonarcloud.io/github), you get:\r\n\r\n-   Fast, precise static analysis and feedback on your code\r\n    \r\n-   Support for popular languages, frameworks, and IaC tools\r\n    \r\n-   Free analysis for open-source projects and private projects up to max 50k LoC\r\n    \r\n-   Automatic analysis of pull requests and branches with results reported inline\r\n    \r\n-   IDE Support with [SonarQube for IDE](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarlint/) integration\r\n    \r\n-   Quality Gate (added as a GitHub check) acting at two different levels - first, preventing you from merging pull requests that contain issues - and later, helping you to release only clean, safe code\r\n    \r\n-   Sign up for SonarQube free tier and begin scanning your private and public repositories\r\n    \r\n\r\nA [GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/sonarcloud-scan) is available in the marketplace to make it easy for you (for projects where automatic analysis isn't available).

There may be other places where rounding happens silently, but I guess we won't discover these easily.

But that could be left for a separate PR.\r\n\r\n@mihaibudiu Yes. I know. Many places still use default APIs, which are not completely consistent with this configuration.

This is causing a type mismatch when the actual data in the view is of type DECIMAL(19,0), leading to a VIEW_IS_STALE exception in Trino.\r\n\r\nScenario:\r\n\r\nA Hive view is created with a column of type DECIMAL(19,0) that holds values such as 12345623423423.\r\nThis view is read by Trino, which uses the Coral library for translation.\r\nCoral incorrectly converts the DECIMAL(19,0) type to DECIMAL(12,0).\r\nWhen the view is queried, Trino checks if the actual data type (DECIMAL(19,0)) can be coerced to the defined data type (DECIMAL(12,0)).\r\nThis check fails, leading to a VIEW_IS_STALE exception.\r\n\r\nSuspected Fix:\r\n\r\nThe suspected fix involves updating the convertQuery() method in Coral to correctly translate DECIMAL data types without reducing precision. The method should be able to handle and preserve larger DECIMAL types such as DECIMAL(19,0). This change will ensure that the translated data type in Trino matches the actual data type in Hive, avoiding the VIEW_IS_STALE exception.\r\n\r\nProposed Solution:\r\n\r\nUpdate the convertQuery() method in the Coral library to correctly handle and preserve the original precision of DECIMAL data types during translation. This would involve investigating how the current conversion to DECIMAL(12,0) is happening and updating the logic to maintain the original precision of the data type. We also need to ensure that this change does not adversely affect other parts of the Coral library or its functionality. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/2325995269/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/2326811400","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/3944#issuecomment-2326811400","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/3944","id":2326811400,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAUNjNM6KsFMI","user":{"login":"mihaibudiu","id":19397042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Mzk3MDQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19397042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihaibudiu","html_url":"https://github.com/mihaibudiu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihaibudiu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihaibudiu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihaibudiu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihaibudiu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihaibudiu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihaibudiu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihaibudiu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihaibudiu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihaibudiu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-03T15:25:15Z","updated_at":"2024-09-03T15:25:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This should be an issue in JIRA.
