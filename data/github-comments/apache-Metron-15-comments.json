Looking over this again, I am a little ambivalent about this PR.  \r\n\r\nI did as an experiment. I thought it would be cool, if parameter handling could be taken care of auto-magically.  I wanted to just specify the parameters that I need via the annotation and have some shared logic perform parameter handling and validation, along with enhancing the docs.  Seems more DRY-ish and all that.\r\n\r\nAs this stands, I don't think it is very useful.  Different functions want to handle required params in different ways.  Sometimes an exception is thrown, sometime a value is returned like NaN, etc.  This doesn't give you any flexibility in how to respond to missing params.   There are probably a few other things that need to be covered before this is close to being useful.\r\n\r\nI would be interested in opinions on this though.  Maybe with input from others this could become useful.  But right now, I am a -1 on this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/262384261/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/262508469","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/365#issuecomment-262508469","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/365","id":262508469,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MjUwODQ2OQ==","user":{"login":"justinleet","id":5077341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzczNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5077341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet","html_url":"https://github.com/justinleet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-23T13:09:13Z","updated_at":"2016-11-23T13:09:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mmiklavc Looks like https://github.com/apache/incubator-metron/pull/362 for METRON-575 got pulled in yesterday.

a lot for reviewing this, Otto.  \r\n\r\nRegarding the WriterBoltIntegrationTest, the topics looks good.  I had to do a bit of digging to confirm them, because I didn't realize they're kinda hidden in ParserTopologyBuilder, but it looks like ENRICHMENT_TOPIC, DEFAULT_PARSER_INVALID_TOPIC, and DEFAULT_PARSER_ERROR_TOPIC are what you want and what you have.\r\n\r\nThe reason this PR differs is because enrichment is specifically managed by the test.yaml, so the way components get hooked up is different and required me to define bolts to actually write the errors to Kafka topics.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/262576334/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/262620768","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/365#issuecomment-262620768","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/365","id":262620768,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MjYyMDc2OA==","user":{"login":"mmiklavc","id":658443,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODQ0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/658443?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc","html_url":"https://github.com/mmiklavc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-23T20:19:31Z","updated_at":"2016-11-23T20:19:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ended up making a few additional changes here. First, got rid of the /apps/metron/enrichment directory entirely. With indexing being split off into its own topology, this no longer made sense to live there. Furthermore, \"indexed\" was the only thing that lived in the enrichment directory in hdfs. The indexed doc path will now live in /apps/metron/indexing/indexed to keep consistent with the dir structure we used in the past. In addition, I've now exposed the directory as a property the user can both see and modify in the advanced properties section in Ambari.\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/658443/20577395/4931cdd0-b17f-11e6-94e6-659ba134837e.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/658443/20577407/5d5f0f2a-b17f-11e6-9036-5202af5a3252.png)\r\n\r\nLastly,

The difference is that your link covers dependency issues, but I'm interested in general pom issues (e.g. using the deprecated variable).\r\n\r\nI'm also inclined to consider point two more important, partially because I don't want to generalize a bunch of dependencies that end up not actual being general anyway if they're unused. Any objections to that plan?\r\n\r\nI'm inclined to create two follow up tickets, one for each of them.  I'm happy to pick up the second one, given that it's pretty related to this ticket.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/263707703/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/263714632","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/378#issuecomment-263714632","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/378","id":263714632,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MzcxNDYzMg==","user":{"login":"dlyle65535","id":3439113,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MzkxMTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3439113?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535","html_url":"https://github.com/dlyle65535","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-29T22:05:03Z","updated_at":"2016-11-29T22:05:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"No objections- a caveat though.
