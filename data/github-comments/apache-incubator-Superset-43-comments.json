I'm not sure why would anyone run this type of application on Windows, sounds like a world of troubles. We're not planning on supporting Windows as we can't run tests on it. You're free to play around with Superset in windows, but would advise against using Windows for production.\n2. As for mobile support Caravel doesn't look too bad on mobile as we use responsive components (even the dashboard grid is responsive and dashboards can be designed where they'll look pretty good on mobile) but its definitely not the first class citizen. As lots of corporate users don't have VPN on their phones it's not been a real use case for us historically, but really like to see work in that direction.\n3. Can be achieved with views at the moment. We're considering adding \"forced predicate permissions\" in the future, where predicates would be defined as in \"sales_team_name='north-east'\" and associated with related tables. Users with a role containing that \"forced predicate\" would see this predicated applied automatically anytime they query one of these tables \n4. SqlAlchemy works well, SSAS is a very different type of query dialect and would require a specific implementation. About CSV and external data, we recommend allowing users a path to load their own data in their analytics playground. Caravel could do that eventually through some \"CSV uploader\" feature. We assume you handle your joins upstream, not in Caravel. Meaning you can create views or data pipelines that prepare your data, and only then query that in Caravel. We may add a feature to define \"many to one\" joins in the future. \n\nAbout data storage, Caravel doesn't store anything, it queries your datasource on the fly. Note that some caching can be setup where the json behind individual view will be cached in something like memcache or redis. This allows for dashboards to load very quickly and prevent overloading the database when lots of people open dashboards with lots of slices at the same time.\n\nAbout sharing, it's possible for people to share dashboards and slices to allow other people to alter them.\n\nFor customization, and depending on whether you want to alter the frontend or backend or both, you'll need an engineer fluent with modern open source workflows on Github, Python / Flask, Javascript / React / ES6 / Bootstrap.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/260197446/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/260236524","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/1515#issuecomment-260236524","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/1515","id":260236524,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MDIzNjUyNA==","user":{"login":"ganshanshan","id":19347709,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzQ3NzA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19347709?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ganshanshan","html_url":"https://github.com/ganshanshan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ganshanshan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ganshanshan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ganshanshan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ganshanshan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ganshanshan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ganshanshan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ganshanshan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ganshanshan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ganshanshan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-14T02:45:18Z","updated_at":"2016-11-14T02:45:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@bkyryliuk

anyone else make any progress with this issue?  From what I can tell, it's still happening...\n\nSteps to re-create:\n1) I pulled the latest version of Superset from GH this AM.  Commit: 2133056c04d20807ea0c503d0fed235ee20e94bb\n2) Install/build node dependencies.\n3) Started superset.  \n\nWhen tested via Chrome, everything seems to work just fine.  However, when tested from IE11 (from the same machine used to test via Chrome) I see the same error from the screenshot above.  \n\nNote: Superset itself is not installed on Windows - I use my Windows machine only to test with different browsers.  Superset is installed/running from OSX.  \n\nI did a little bit of troubleshooting - there's definitely a difference in the URLs being requested between Chrome and IE.  \n\nIE:\n\n```\n/superset/explore/druid/86/superset/explore_json/druid/86/?viz_type=table&granularity=one+day&druid_time_origin=&since=7+days+ago&until=now&table_timestamp_format=smart_date&row_limit=50000&include_search=false&flt_col_0=&flt_op_0=in&flt_eq_0=&having_col_0=&having_op_0=%3D%3D&having_eq_0=&slice_id=&slice_name=&collapsed_fieldsets=&action=&userid=2&goto_dash=false&datasource_name=Test.DBQL_Analysis_V3&datasource_id=86&datasource_type=druid&previous_viz_type=table&rdo_save=saveas&new_slice_name=&add_to_dash=false&save_to_dashboard_id=&new_dashboard_name=&json=true&force=false\n```\n\nChrome:\n\n```\n/superset/explore_json/druid/86/?viz_type=table&granularity=one+day&druid_time_origin=&since=7+days+ago&until=now&table_timestamp_format=smart_date&row_limit=50000&include_search=false&flt_col_0=&flt_op_0=in&flt_eq_0=&having_col_0=&having_op_0=%3D%3D&having_eq_0=&slice_id=&slice_name=&collapsed_fieldsets=&action=&userid=2&goto_dash=false&datasource_name=Test.DBQL_Analysis_V3&datasource_id=86&datasource_type=druid&previous_viz_type=table&rdo_save=saveas&new_slice_name=&add_to_dash=false&save_to_dashboard_id=&new_dashboard_name=&json=true&force=false\n```\n\nIf it isn't obvious from the above extremely-long URL, the only difference in the above URLs is that, in IE, the URL begins with `/superset/explore/druid/86/`; otherwise the 2 URLs are identical.  \n\nAny idea what could be causing this issue?  Is there any other logs I can provide that might help to reproduce and/or diagnose?  \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/260457781/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/260468245","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/1524#issuecomment-260468245","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/1524","id":260468245,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MDQ2ODI0NQ==","user":{"login":"vera-liu","id":20978302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTc4MzAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20978302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vera-liu","html_url":"https://github.com/vera-liu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vera-liu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vera-liu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vera-liu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vera-liu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vera-liu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vera-liu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vera-liu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vera-liu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vera-liu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-14T21:28:25Z","updated_at":"2016-11-14T21:28:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"https://github.com/airbnb/superset/pull/1583\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/260468245/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/260474371","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/1597#issuecomment-260474371","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/1597","id":260474371,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MDQ3NDM3MQ==","user":{"login":"phreatom","id":436653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNjY1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/436653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phreatom","html_url":"https://github.com/phreatom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phreatom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phreatom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phreatom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phreatom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phreatom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phreatom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phreatom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phreatom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phreatom/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-14T21:51:28Z","updated_at":"2016-11-14T21:51:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"ed48255 seems to fix the empty dashboard.

We have created a \"fake\" user for each team, with emails like teamX@shopkick.com. Then, each user that creates a new dashboard also adds her team to the owners. This way, we can easily list all dashboard of a team X, by filtering owner in \"teamX@shopkick.com\".\n\nWhat typically happens is that a user (think of manager/C-level) requests a dashboard, someone else in the company creates it, adding the right team as an owner, and the person who requested can see the dashboard without any further action, no favorite, no activity, etc.\n\nRight now, however, people still have to enter the right search url, and we would like to make that url their default homepage.\n\nIn some sense the 2 things seem orthogonal to me. What I was proposing is an homepage field in the user profile, such that one can write any url there. What @mistercrunch is proposing is a more personalized homepage, but let say same url for everybody.\n\nI think the 2 solutions can also co-exists. Clearly if the personalized homepage works well, there's no need to change the url, but I can still see use cases, e.g. for external users/partners/or specific people inside the company where you just want a different behavior, thus a different url. Make
