is typically used for distributed applications, meaning more than\none process across one or more hosts.

Co-locating in one JVM is only\npossible with spring boot, unless you write a even more custom app.\n\nPeople usually encounter issues when they try to make custom servers which\nincreases the burden on this project which is why it isnt supported.

It is possible we could allow a config to whitelist keys to index (like http.path)\r\n\r\n@adriancole, a whitelist sounds like a good idea to start with.\r\n\r\nbeyond that: the only reason we're using `CONTAINS` here is because SASI on collections types are not supported. see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-11182\r\n\r\ni'm thinking the right way to move forward would be to denormalise the annotations like…\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS zipkin2.span_by_annotation_query (\r\n    trace_id            text, // when strictTraceId=false, only contains right-most 16 chars\r\n    ts_uuid             timeuuid,\r\n    id                  text,\r\n    trace_id_high       text, // when strictTraceId=false, contains left-most 16 chars if present\r\n    annotation_query    text, \r\n    PRIMARY KEY         (trace_id, ts_uuid, id, annotation_query)\r\n);\r\n\r\nCREATE CUSTOM INDEX IF NOT EXISTS ON zipkin2.span_by_annotation_query (annotation_query) USING 'org.apache.cassandra.index.sasi.SASIIndex'\r\n   WITH OPTIONS = {'mode': 'PREFIX'};\r\n```\r\nEach annotation would be written to `annotation_query`, instead of the `░` joined string.\r\n\r\nAnd the look-up would then mean in `SelectTraceIdsFromSpan`…\r\n\r\n - the statement would instead be prepared with `QueryBuilder.like(\"annotation_query\", bindMarker(\"annotation_query\"))`\r\n - and the statement called with  just `annotationKey` instead of `\"%░\" + annotationKey + \"░%\"`.\r\n\r\nThis would allow removing the `span.annotation_query` column and its `CONTAINS` SASI.\r\n\r\nA custom TokenizingAnalyzer is another approach, and would be very cool to see.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/353510778/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/353539026","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1860#issuecomment-353539026","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1860","id":353539026,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MzUzOTAyNg==","user":{"login":"WangHouLing","id":20981477,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTgxNDc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20981477?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangHouLing","html_url":"https://github.com/WangHouLing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangHouLing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangHouLing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangHouLing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangHouLing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangHouLing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangHouLing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangHouLing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangHouLing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangHouLing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-22T07:26:32Z","updated_at":"2017-12-25T01:40:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"If

Here's an example:\r\n\r\nWe have this exact problem with our [swagger](https://swagger.io/) RPC endpoints. Using the petstore [example](http://petstore.swagger.io/), `GET /pet/{petId}` will show up as `/pet/1234` in the `http.uri`. So 1) it is difficult to know that that corresponds to the `/pet/{petId}` path template, and 2) it is impossible to know that it corresponds to the GET version of that vs the DELETE or POST versions.\r\n\r\nWe solve the second problem by making the span `name` equal to the method and the path in [pyramid_zipkin](https://github.com/Yelp/pyramid_zipkin/blob/master/pyramid_zipkin/tween.py#L64). However, this doesn't solve the path parameter problem (the uri template).\r\n\r\nThe Correct Way to solve this would be to use any identifier guaranteed to uniquely identify the endpoint, which in the swagger case is [operationId](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.1.md#operation-object). I think that this should just be set as the span `name` as I think @SergeyKanzhelev is alluding to.

Here's an example:\n>\n> We have this exact problem with our swagger <https://swagger.io/> RPC\n> endpoints. Using the petstore example <http://petstore.swagger.io/>, GET\n> /pet/{petId} will show up as /pet/1234 in the http.uri. So 1) it is\n> difficult to know that that corresponds to the /pet/{petId} path\n> template, and 2) it is impossible to know that it corresponds to the GET\n> version of that vs the DELETE or POST versions.\n>\n^^ is a tricky problem, and something to deal with in implementation. In\nbrave, we are thinking about using both the request and response to derive\nthe template, which means you can see what the method is. When you can't\nderive a template, you don't produce the tag. Ex. if the framework can't\ntell you, then probably better to not add a tag than add one with infinite\ncardinality.\n\nOn URI templates, for better or worse we already know that deviations are\nused, so probably not best to promise URI template formatting, rather focus\non the limited cardinality aspect.\nWhether or not DELETE or POST is in the template is up to us to decide.\nHttp methods are fixed cardinality, and since a primary consumer of this is\nmetrics, it sort of depends on if the system supports multiple lookup keys\nor not. One thing that could be easier is this.. It is often easier to\nstrip a method than assume it is always there. We could say that the\ntemplate or whatever we call it tag does not include the method. In fact\nthis is probably easier for all frameworks I can think of.. Would that\nhelp?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/356130961/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/356145852","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1870#issuecomment-356145852","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1870","id":356145852,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NjE0NTg1Mg==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-09T00:58:54Z","updated_at":"2018-01-09T00:58:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":">\n>
