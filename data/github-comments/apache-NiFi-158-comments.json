Communicating with one of the data nodes - this option is the least recommended as it's likely to cause very high CPU and heap usage and when ingesting/querying large amount of data the said data node is bound to crash\r\n2. Using a coordinator node - What is means is to still communicate with a single node, but one that does not store data, which means that it's load is smaller, yet here as well, with enough data (unfortunately i have been there) it to crashes\r\n3. Using an external load balancer such as Nginx or HAproxy - It is a legit option which guarantees zero crashing, unless your cluster is not large enough to handle that much querying/ingestion and in which case no way will work for you :(\r\n4. Load balancing in the client - by far the best option because of the same pros that were introduced in the previous one with no need of maintaining another server(s) and another technology\r\n\r\nBasically at large scale the only valid options are 3 and 4, so to spare the need of a third-party load balancer i think that this feature is important. Also, you might look at the changes i made and observe that i implemented round robin load balancing (using Iterables.cycle()) which means the okHttp client still works with a single url every time, just a different one :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/898953890/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/898973786","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4552#issuecomment-898973786","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4552","id":898973786,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM41lUBa","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-15T00:07:01Z","updated_at":"2021-08-15T00:07:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"We're marking this PR as stale due to lack of updates in the past few months.

But when one is created, if it inherits from other contexts, we do not check if the user has READ permissions to the inherited contexts. (I.e., we check READ for inherited contexts when you update a context but not when we create it)\r\n\r\nI think if we are modifying the Parameter Context, the permissions checking may need to be a bit more in-depth, too. If you are modifying the parameter context, initially we were saying you only need WRITE to the parameter context in question. But because the list of included parameter contexts may be changing, I think we need to enforce READ on all inherited contexts as well. Specifically, we need to enforce that if you want to update a parameter context, you need WRITE on the parameter context and READ on all parameter contexts that it currently inherits from and READ on all parameter contexts that it will inherit from after the update. For example Parameter Context A, and it currently inheriting from B, and I want to change it to inherit from only C. I need WRITE to Context A and READ to Context B and C. If I just want to change the name for Parameter Context A, I need WRITE to A and READ to B.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/901976823/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/902004066","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5072#issuecomment-902004066","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5072","id":902004066,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM41w31i","user":{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-19T15:19:25Z","updated_at":"2021-08-19T15:19:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I did confirm that the above issues were addressed though :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/902004066/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":1,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/902030784","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5262#issuecomment-902030784","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5262","id":902030784,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM41w-XA","user":{"login":"thenatog","id":38888042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg4MDQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38888042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog","html_url":"https://github.com/thenatog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-19T15:55:27Z","updated_at":"2021-08-19T15:55:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This PR looks good to me - tested logging in and using the flow, advanced UI and downloading flow file content in a secure cluster.

But when one is created, if it inherits from other contexts, we do not check if the user has READ permissions to the inherited contexts. (I.e., we check READ for inherited contexts when you update a context but not when we create it)\r\n> \r\n> I think if we are modifying the Parameter Context, the permissions checking may need to be a bit more in-depth, too. If you are modifying the parameter context, initially we were saying you only need WRITE to the parameter context in question. But because the list of included parameter contexts may be changing, I think we need to enforce READ on all inherited contexts as well. Specifically, we need to enforce that if you want to update a parameter context, you need WRITE on the parameter context and READ on all parameter contexts that it currently inherits from and READ on all parameter contexts that it will inherit from after the update. For example Parameter Context A, and it currently inheriting from B, and I want to change it to inherit from only C. I need WRITE to Context A and READ to Context B and C. If I just want to change the name for Parameter Context A, I need WRITE to A and READ to B.\r\n\r\nThanks @markap14, great idea with the permissions.  I made this adjustment and pushed the changes.  Although I agree that generally you should require READ on inherited parameter contexts, I'm wondering more about the case of removing an inherited parameter context.  As it is described above (and in the code now), if I suddenly discover I no longer have access to an inherited parameter context (Context B above), I can not remove it from Context A.  Perhaps this is okay, in that the solution would be for me to contact the administrator, who could remove it, but I just wanted to point out that users might expect they could at least remove an inherited Context they didn't have access to.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/902582782/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/902583362","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5072#issuecomment-902583362","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5072","id":902583362,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM41zFRC","user":{"login":"gresockj","id":423565,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMzU2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/423565?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gresockj","html_url":"https://github.com/gresockj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gresockj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gresockj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gresockj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gresockj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gresockj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gresockj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gresockj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gresockj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gresockj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-20T10:03:48Z","updated_at":"2021-08-20T10:03:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> @gresockj When attempting to create a ParameterContext that inherited from others I received the following error.\r\n> \r\n> ![Screen Shot 2021-08-19 at 4 06 45 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123395/130138132-9ae89799-147f-40c0-9645-bc3b119e3728.png)\r\n\r\nThanks for pointing this out, @mcgilman!

So, an initial build of nifi-registry will have to be performed (or deps available in a remote maven repo for the particular version you are building.)\r\n\r\nAs for excluding NiFi from the other builds, e.g. NiFi Registry, I had originally considered that. However, I did not believe it was necessary. If you want to build NiFi Registry, for example, you simply run the build from ~/nifi/nifi-registry rather than from the project root, ~/nifi/. (Alternatively, run the build with `-f` flag from maven specifying the ~/nifi/nifi-registry/pom.xml.)\r\n\r\nI just tried that, and there are in fact dependencies required by nifi-registry.\r\n`Could not find artifact org.apache.nifi:nifi-sensitive-property-provider:jar:1.15.0-SNAPSHOT `\r\n\r\nSo, it appears that this is problematic in both cases (building NiFi without NiFi Registry, or building NiFi Registry without NiFi). However, the use case here is for repeated development builds. I think it would still be a useful feature for a developer and/or CI/CD after performing a full build for a given version. This allows a similar strategy as building a single NAR bundle without requiring a re-build of the entire project.\r\n\r\nStill  open to suggestions if you find the existing behavior too limiting.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/906481048/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/906603315","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5301#issuecomment-906603315","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5301","id":906603315,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM42Casz","user":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-26T17:29:44Z","updated_at":"2021-08-26T17:29:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"There's a merge conflict now","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/906603315/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/906668143","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5335#issuecomment-906668143","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5335","id":906668143,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM42Cqhv","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-26T19:05:19Z","updated_at":"2021-08-26T19:05:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the review @adenes!

The first thing that I did was to look at the Usage to understand how to use the processors. Unfortunately, they don't really provide much of any documentation at all.

This is really important for any & all scripted components because otherwise users are just kind of taking a shot in the dark, guessing how to use it. Would recommend looking at the additionalDetails of ScriptedTransformRecord. Specifically, it will be important to explain how the return values are to be returned. For example, Jython won't allow you to use a `return true` syntax - you have to set `_ = true`, etc. This is important to call out. It's also crucial to call out all of the variable bindings so that users know what they have access to, and to ensure that we provide examples - I would say at least 1 example in Groovy and 1 in Jython would be ideal, as these are by far the most commonly used.\r\n\r\nI did also notice that there was an additionalDetails from the ScriptedRouteRecord, which is the one we removed. So we need to make sure that its additionalDetails.html is removed. Additionally, the other Scripted components list ScriptedRouteRecord in their @SeeAlso annotation, so we'll want to remove that also.\r\n\r\nIn testing, I wanted to see how it handled an Exception being thrown, so I created a simple Groovy script:\r\n```\r\nthrow new RuntimeException(\"Oops\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe processor (ScriptedValidateRecord in this case) did properly route the incoming FlowFile to failure. However, the error message that I got was not accurate:\r\n```\r\n2021-08-27 21:23:42,129 ERROR [Timer-Driven Process Thread-8] o.a.n.p.script.ScriptedValidateRecord ScriptedValidateRecord[id=8a4da405-017b-1000-54c8-e807155bed3b] Failed to route records for StandardFlowFileRecord[uuid=71d42d80-8e63-4d13-815c-ae0106eeed3b,claim=StandardContentClaim [resourceClaim=StandardResourceClaim[id=1630113179238-1, container=default, section=1], offset=243, length=100],offset=0,name=71d42d80-8e63-4d13-815c-ae0106eeed3b,size=100]: org.apache.nifi.processor.exception.ProcessException: Failed to parse incoming FlowFile\r\norg.apache.nifi.processor.exception.ProcessException: Failed to parse incoming FlowFile\r\n\tat org.apache.nifi.processors.script.ScriptedRouterProcessor$1.process(ScriptedRouterProcessor.java:194)\r\n\tat org.apache.nifi.controller.repository.StandardProcessSession.read(StandardProcessSession.java:2466)\r\n\tat org.apache.nifi.controller.repository.StandardProcessSession.read(StandardProcessSession.java:2434)\r\n\tat org.apache.nifi.processors.script.ScriptedRouterProcessor.route(ScriptedRouterProcessor.java:126)\r\n\tat org.apache.nifi.processors.script.ScriptedRouterProcessor.onTrigger(ScriptedRouterProcessor.java:107)\r\n\tat org.apache.nifi.processor.AbstractProcessor.onTrigger(AbstractProcessor.java:27)\r\n\tat org.apache.nifi.controller.StandardProcessorNode.onTrigger(StandardProcessorNode.java:1202)\r\n\tat org.apache.nifi.controller.tasks.ConnectableTask.invoke(ConnectableTask.java:214)\r\n\tat org.apache.nifi.controller.scheduling.AbstractTimeBasedSchedulingAgent.lambda$doScheduleOnce$0(AbstractTimeBasedSchedulingAgent.java:63)\r\n\tat org.apache.nifi.engine.FlowEngine$2.run(FlowEngine.java:110)\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.Executors$RunnableAdapter.call(Executors.java:511)\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.run(FutureTask.java:266)\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor$ScheduledFutureTask.access$201(ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.java:180)\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor$ScheduledFutureTask.run(ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.java:293)\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1149)\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:624)\r\n\tat java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:748)\r\nCaused by: javax.script.ScriptException: javax.script.ScriptException: java.lang.RuntimeException: Oops\r\n\tat org.codehaus.groovy.jsr223.GroovyScriptEngineImpl.eval(GroovyScriptEngineImpl.java:162)\r\n\tat javax.script.AbstractScriptEngine.eval(AbstractScriptEngine.java:233)\r\n\tat org.apache.nifi.processors.script.InterpretedScriptEvaluator.evaluate(InterpretedScriptEvaluator.java:47)\r\n\tat org.apache.nifi.processors.script.ScriptedRouterProcessor$1.process(ScriptedRouterProcessor.java:143)\r\n\t... 16 common frames omitted\r\nCaused by: javax.script.ScriptException: java.lang.RuntimeException: Oops\r\n\tat org.codehaus.groovy.jsr223.GroovyScriptEngineImpl.eval(GroovyScriptEngineImpl.java:324)\r\n\tat org.codehaus.groovy.jsr223.GroovyScriptEngineImpl.eval(GroovyScriptEngineImpl.java:159)\r\n\t... 19 common frames omitted\r\nCaused by: java.lang.RuntimeException: Oops\r\n\tat sun.reflect.NativeConstructorAccessorImpl.newInstance0(Native Method)\r\n\tat sun.reflect.NativeConstructorAccessorImpl.newInstance(NativeConstructorAccessorImpl.java:62)\r\n\tat sun.reflect.DelegatingConstructorAccessorImpl.newInstance(DelegatingConstructorAccessorImpl.java:45)\r\n\tat java.lang.reflect.Constructor.newInstance(Constructor.java:423)\r\n\tat org.codehaus.groovy.reflection.CachedConstructor.invoke(CachedConstructor.java:83)\r\n\tat org.codehaus.groovy.runtime.callsite.ConstructorSite$ConstructorSiteNoUnwrapNoCoerce.callConstructor(ConstructorSite.java:105)\r\n\tat org.codehaus.groovy.runtime.callsite.CallSiteArray.defaultCallConstructor(CallSiteArray.java:59)\r\n\tat org.codehaus.groovy.runtime.callsite.AbstractCallSite.callConstructor(AbstractCallSite.java:237)\r\n\tat org.codehaus.groovy.runtime.callsite.AbstractCallSite.callConstructor(AbstractCallSite.java:249)\r\n\tat Script7.run(Script7.groovy:1)\r\n\tat org.codehaus.groovy.jsr223.GroovyScriptEngineImpl.eval(GroovyScriptEngineImpl.java:321)\r\n\t... 20 common frames omitted\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere was no error parsing the incoming FlowFile - it parsed just fine. The error was in evaluating the script against the record. It will be important that we give an accurate error message. And because a FlowFile may have many (often thousands or more) records, it will be much easier to understand what the problem is if the error message indicates which Record was being processed when it failed. For example: \"Failed to process Record 529 in FlowFile[...]\"\r\n\r\nOtherwise, I think all is looking good!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/907546294/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/907571493","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5354#issuecomment-907571493","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5354","id":907571493,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM42GHEl","user":{"login":"naddym","id":10363056,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzYzMDU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10363056?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/naddym","html_url":"https://github.com/naddym","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naddym/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naddym/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naddym/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naddym/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naddym/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naddym/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naddym/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naddym/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naddym/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-28T05:07:39Z","updated_at":"2021-08-28T05:07:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @thadguidry for the improvement.

I'm not sure what controls that setting, but you might want to post on nifi-dev so you can be tagged without a comment.\r\n\r\nThanks for the reply @MikeThomsen, taking a look through and updating the other PRs would be very helpful.

Just have a few input. I was able to run the build and verify that it was working. I was wondering, documentation-wise, if we could probably put a note about uncommenting the `bootstrap-*.conf` file path in the `bootstrap.conf` for each specific cloud provider somewhere in `toolkit-guide.adoc` or `administration-guide.adoc`? \r\n\r\nAlso I was wondering if it would be better if `EncodedSensitivePropertiesProvider` extends `AbstractSensitivePropertyProvider`, that way the shared methods `getName()` and `getIdentifierKey()` would not have to be rewritten and the `getProtectionScheme()` could be implemented there.\r\n\r\nOther minor suggestions include changing naming of `EncodedSensitivePropertiesProvider` to`EncodedSensitivePropertyProvider`. And also similarly for the `ClientBasedEncodedSensitivePropertiesProvider`. That way the naming will be consistent.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/911920467/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
