However it's not that simple.\nIn order to do that, we would need to completely implement a new protocol (S7Comm Plus).\nIn the past it was impossible to do so because of legal reasons. \n\nEven if Siemens has changed things that now make it possible to implement a S7Comm Plus driver, there is currently nobody able and willing to work on this. I personally have given up investing my free time if I'm not compensated for it in any form. Perhaps someone else is willing to pick up the ball. \n\nSo currently don't expect this to happen any time
