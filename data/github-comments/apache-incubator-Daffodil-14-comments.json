The xml-apis library is typically used to provide a consistent set of XML APIs across different Java versions and implementations, but it is not needed on Java 8.\r\n\r\nWhen I asked ChatGPT if Xerces needs xml-apis at all, here's the last thing it said:\r\n\r\n> Xerces is designed to work with xml-apis to provide a complete XML processing solution for Java programs. While it is possible to use Xerces without xml-apis, it may require more work to integrate Xerces with other XML-related libraries that depend on xml-apis.\r\n\r\nI suspect the real answer is yes, we can exclude xml-apis from Daffodil's dependencies, but we'd better be prepared to do a lot of testing in diverse environments because the whole point of xml-apis is to provide a consistent set of XML APIs in these diverse environments.  Still, Saxon also works in many diverse environments so if it can exclude xml-apis safely, it does seem to me that Daffodil can exclude xml-apis safely too.  \r\n\r\nBTW, Daffodil brought in Saxon in order to support daffodil-schematron, but Saxon is an XML processor and XSLT transformer just like Xerces. If you want to eliminate as many unneeded dependencies as possible, Daffodil probably could use Saxon instead of Xerces for everything that Daffodil uses Xerces to do.  However, you would need to replace all of Daffodil's org.apache.xerces.[*] imports, change some calls, find and fix problems, and do a lot of testing for some dubious benefit (although Saxon is maintained and Xerces is not).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/1533360489/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/1534604000","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/1012#issuecomment-1534604000","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/1012","id":1534604000,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhBG1s5beDLg","user":{"login":"stevedlawrence","id":3180601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODA2MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3180601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence","html_url":"https://github.com/stevedlawrence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-04T11:28:48Z","updated_at":"2023-05-04T11:28:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Agreed about replacing Xerces with Saxon.

Unfortunately that might be a while, likely not until 2.0 at the earliest, but I don't think we're in any rush to update jline.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/1538795263/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/1570111637","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/992#issuecomment-1570111637","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/992","id":1570111637,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhBG1s5dlgCV","user":{"login":"stevedlawrence","id":3180601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODA2MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3180601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence","html_url":"https://github.com/stevedlawrence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-31T12:16:16Z","updated_at":"2023-05-31T12:16:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@mike-mcgann is busy on other stuff, so I took over this and fixed up the last remaining comments.

Here's that function:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/scala/scala-xml/blob/main/shared/src/main/scala/scala/xml/parsing/FactoryAdapter.scala#L114-L144\r\n\r\nThis is because that function sets the private `xmlReader` variable that is later required to be defined when `endDocument` is called or else it throws a `NoSuchElementException`.\r\n\r\nFortunately, it is a pretty straightforward change in the `DaffodilXMLLoader` to call `loadDocument` instead of directly calling `xmlReader.parse(..)`. It's just a one-liner change:\r\n```diff\r\ndaffodil-lib/src/main/scala/org/apache/daffodil/lib/xml/DaffodilXMLLoader.scala \r\n@@ -687,9 +687,14 @@ class DaffodilXMLLoader(val errorHandler: org.xml.sax.ErrorHandler)\r\n       val parser = parserFromURI(optSchemaURI)\r\n       val xrdr = parser.getXMLReader()\r\n       val saxSource = scala.xml.Source.fromSysId(source.uriForLoading.toString)\r\n       try {\r\n-        xrdr.parse(saxSource)\r\n+        loadDocument(saxSource, xrdr)\r\n       } catch {\r\n         // can be thrown by the resolver if a schemaLocation of\r\n         // an import/include cannot be resolved.\r\n         // Regular Xerces doesn't report that as an error.\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this leads to errors when that tries to validate the XML (which is the point of this bit of code), with errors like:\r\n> SAXParseException: cvc-elt.1.a: Cannot find the declaration of element 'tdml:testSuite'\r\n \r\nI've found that the following line in the `loadDocument` function is the culprit:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/scala/scala-xml/blob/main/shared/src/main/scala/scala/xml/parsing/FactoryAdapter.scala#L120\r\n\r\nThe entity resolver is actually null, so scala-xml sets one with `setEntityResolver`, which seems to break things. Instead, the resolver must be set with this, which is what we we do in our `DaffodilXMLLoader`.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nxrdr.setProperty(\"http://apache.org/xml/properties/internal/entity-resolver\", resolver)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I think that is Xerces specific so can't be part of scala-xml.\r\n\r\nBut even with that, `setEntityResolver` being called still breaks things.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure why an `EntityResolver` set with `setEntityResolver` doesn't work, but I'm not sure of a good workaround. We could suggest a change to scala-xml to make it so it doesn't set an entity resolver at all, with the assumption that the caller does it in an appropriate way (e.g. setEntityResolver vs setProperty). Or maybe we're doing something wrong in how we set up the XML reader and a change would allow it to work via setEntityResolver?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/1645676989/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/1645793651","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/1058#issuecomment-1645793651","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/1058","id":1645793651,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhBG1s5iGNFz","user":{"login":"mbeckerle","id":1524099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1524099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle","html_url":"https://github.com/mbeckerle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-21T15:52:13Z","updated_at":"2023-07-21T15:52:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Just a couple minor comments/questions.\r\n> \r\n> As to changing most usage calls to invariants, that doesn't seem totally unreasonable to me. However, I think it could be argued that the two are different things that could warrant different names. One check is bad parameters passed into internal functions, and one is checking for bad internal state. You could argue different function names might make it more clear what's being checked (e.g. internalUsage() vs invariant() or something), but I'm not sure there's a lot of extra benefit. It both cases, a failure represents an internal bug in Daffodil, so calling invariant seems reasonable, and is definiely simpler. But I don't feel strongly about it. I could be swayed either way if there is a preference for separate function names.\r\n> \r\n> @mbeckerle any thoughts?\r\n\r\nusage is \"argCheck\", and invariant is  \"stateCheck\". Both are for our own internal use. These pre-date our API modules (JAPI/SAPI). \r\n\r\nArguably those should document and throw specific exceptions from each public method. And we should define the exceptions they throw and convenient checker methods directly *in those modules themselves*. \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/1645793651/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/1645801276","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/1049#issuecomment-1645801276","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/1049","id":1645801276,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhBG1s5iGO88","user":{"login":"mbeckerle","id":1524099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1524099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle","html_url":"https://github.com/mbeckerle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-21T15:58:34Z","updated_at":"2023-07-21T15:58:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think we need to report this as a bug in scala-xml-2.2.0. \r\n\r\nIt has to smoothly use our resolver and continue to have an API where we can set that. \r\n\r\nre: can scala-xml use a xerces-specific thing....

Based on some of your comments there are places where usage should be invariant or vice versa so there's clearly some confusing between the different names that this would alleviate.\r\n\r\nYeah, in hind-sight now I think almost all those changes of usage to invariant are wrong.

That is perhaps a useful new method. But precondition checks are another kind of usage-error check. We have lots of lazy vals in our code where there are no arguments, but there are still usage errors in that one can \"use them wrong\" and we want to make clear when you are using them wrong. \r\n\r\nIf that kind of check is  not going to be usage(...) they should be either argCheck(...) or precondition(...) both of which, when they fail, issue a kind of usage error. They indicate a programmer's fairly immediate local mistake in the way the thing was called or nearby context of that call. I prefer usage(...) myself, because in lazy code often things being checked are not arguments. \r\n\r\ninvariant() is for things that are potentially more distant from the local calling context. Really its just about making assumptions of the code explicit so if under maintenance somebody changes the way things work and things code is relying on change, that there are explicit checks to detect this. It's also used for postcondition checks - when a certain method finishes some condition should hold. \r\n\r\nSo I'm ok with argCheck, preCondition, and invariant as names of different methods. But usage an invariant are sufficient I think. \r\n\r\nWe should improve the scaladoc on those sorts of methods, but I'm very opposed to changing the name of 'invariant' to anything else or losing the distinction of usage errors (arg or precondition) vs. invariant failure. \r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/1646024096/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/1646069098","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/1049#issuecomment-1646069098","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/1049","id":1646069098,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhBG1s5iHQVq","user":{"login":"stevedlawrence","id":3180601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODA2MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3180601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence","html_url":"https://github.com/stevedlawrence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-21T18:08:14Z","updated_at":"2023-07-21T18:08:14Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I've opened an issue: [scala/scala-xml#689](https://togithub.com/scala/scala-xml/issues/689).

Note that we could just do `Paths.get(s).toUri.toString` and pass that into `resolveSchemaLocation`, letting `Paths.get()` handle all the weirdness around resolving relative paths on different OSes. But that doesn't work with classpath resources. It also means we lose relative path information which I'm hoping to avoid (`toUri()` always returns an absolute URI, I think because not all relative Windows paths can be converted a relative URI). I *think* it might be useful to keep URIs relative as part of depersonalizing schema paths in saved parsers (see my comments in PR #1065). This commit doesn't attempt to address that PR, but it at least doesn't make things harder.\r\n\r\nThe `schemaLocation` attribute in a XSD schema *must* be a URI, regardless of OS. So we just treat that attribute as if it were a URI.

There's one code-cov failure I saw where it would I think be of value to add a test to cover.\r\n\r\nI think the only way to trigger this code is if an element with dfdlx:repType is defined is in a hidden group while unparsing. However, this would mean that element also needs a dfdl:outputValueCalc. For example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n    <xs:simpleType name=\"rep\" dfdl:lengthKind=\"explicit\" dfdl:length=\"1\">\r\n      <xs:restriction base=\"xs:byte\"/>\r\n    </xs:simpleType>\r\n\r\n    <xs:group name=\"hiddenField\">\r\n      <xs:sequence>\r\n        <xs:element name=\"field\" dfdlx:repType=\"tns:rep\" dfdl:outputValueCalc=\"{ ../ex:visField }\">\r\n          <xs:simpleType>\r\n            <xs:restriction base=\"xs:string\">\r\n              <xs:enumeration value=\"one\" dfdlx:repValues=\"1\" />\r\n              <xs:enumeration value=\"two\" dfdlx:repValues=\"2\" />\r\n              <xs:enumeration value=\"three\" dfdlx:repValues=\"3\" />\r\n            </xs:restriction>\r\n          </xs:simpleType>\r\n        </xs:element>\r\n      </xs:sequence>\r\n    </xs:group>\r\n\r\n    <xs:element name=\"root1\">\r\n      <xs:complexType>\r\n        <xs:sequence>\r\n          <xs:group ref=\"ex:hiddenField\" />\r\n          <xs:element name=\"visField\" type=\"xs:string\" dfdl:inputValueCalc=\"{ ../ex:field }\" />\r\n        </xs:sequence>\r\n      </xs:complexType>\r\n    </xs:element>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut so far I haven't been able to get unparsing to work with this. There seems to be some weird suspension issue where the outputValueCalc expression can't find the visField element. I'm guessing it has something to do with the detached quasi element messing with the infoset, but haven't dug much further so far.\r\n\r\nThat said, I wonder if it's even worth trying to support dfdlx:repType + dfdl:ouputValueCalc? A repType inside hidden groups seems unlikely since the whole point of repTypes it to convert an int to a more human friendly string. If it's hidden is it worth doing that conversion at all?

I'd be fine with just adding to the java/scaladoc a standard comment and naming convention indicating that a method is internal not to be considered part of the API.

There's a number of commands that the interactive debugger understands (e.g. \"break\", \"step\", \"continue\", \"eval\"). The \"listener\" or \"debugger runner\" is what provides the commands to run and receives the results to display. The name \"interactive\" is probably not the best since it really doesn't need to have user interaction at all (e.g the `TraceDebuggerRunner` just uses a list of predetermined commands). But I think it originally did require user input, but was eventually generalized and the name stuck.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/1856383069/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/1882984941","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/1134#issuecomment-1882984941","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/1134","id":1882984941,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhBG1s5wPBHt","user":{"login":"stevedlawrence","id":3180601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODA2MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3180601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence","html_url":"https://github.com/stevedlawrence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-09T12:28:50Z","updated_at":"2024-01-09T12:28:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"`parsingPadChar` comes from here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/daffodil/blob/main/daffodil-core/src/main/scala/org/apache/daffodil/core/grammar/primitives/Padded.scala#L48-L52\r\n\r\nIf `textTrimKind` is `\"none\"`, then `parsingPadChar` is `None` and the justification is forced to `None`, so we'll never call `remove*Padding` and hit the `isEmpty` true block.\r\n\r\nIf `textTrimKind` is not `\"none\"`, then we require a pad character, so whatever `remove*Padding` function is called (based on the justification), we will have a `parsingPadChar` defined and hit the `isEmpty` false block.\r\n\r\nSo it is reasonable to assert here--it's not possible for `parsingPadChar` to be empty if a `remove*Padding` function is called.
