Search before asking\n\n- [X] I had searched in the [issues](https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues?q=is%3Aissue) and found no similar issues.\n\n\n### What happened\n\nI use k8s deployment (Huawei cloud cce), multiple pods mount the same log volume, and found that the stored files do not distinguish which pod is saved, only master, worker, api, alert can not be specific. A worker, after further inspection, found that the log file for each hour was the log of a certain pod.\r\nThis will make it impossible to query the log after the pod restarts, and it will be meaningless to mount the log volume.\r\n\r\nI used K8S deployment (Huawei cloud CCE), and multiple pods mounted the same log volume. I found that the saved files did not distinguish which POD saved them, but could only distinguish master, worker, API and alert, not specific worker. After Further checking, It was found that the log file of each hour was the log file of a pod.\r\nIn this case, the POD cannot query logs after the restart, and it is meaningless to mount the log volume.\n\n### What you expected to happen\n\nI checked the log related configuration (logback-master.xml, logback-worker.xml, logback-api.xml, logback-alert.xml), the file name of the configuration does not distinguish the specific pod, which will cause all pods to use the same one document.\r\n\r\nI looked at the log configuration (logback-master.XML, logback-worker.XML, logback-api.XML, logback-alert.xml), the configured file name does not discriminate between specific pods, which results in all pods using the same file.\n\n### How to reproduce\n\nMaybe it would be better to join the filename to something like ${hostname}?\r\n\r\nMaybe the filename would be better with a name like ${hostname}?\n\n### Anything else\n\n_No response_\n\n### Version\n\n2.0.5\n\n### Are you willing to

Hi, we are planning to initiate our exploration of AIOps at [Apache SkyWalking community](https://github.com/apache/skywalking/discussions). Very interesting to see the discussions here.\r\n> \r\n> Now I'm also looking at Dolphinscheduler to handle our workflow orchestration, and for now, we may as well go in the same direction as yours. I feel like integration with MLFlow package functionalities will be a good point to boost ML-developer experience to the next level.\r\n\r\nHi, good to see you join the discussion. I just read about your discussion (https://github.com/apache/skywalking/discussions/8883). It should be a great project.\r\n\r\nI think DolphinScheduler will be able to schedule the AIops scenario in the near future. I am enriching its scheduling features in the field of artificial intelligence, and the MVP product is being implemented.\r\n\r\nWe can keep talking about that. BTW, I might do some experiments with this data set, but I can't access it right now. https://github.com/CloudWise-OpenSource/GAIA-DataSet","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1119234197/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1119243314","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/9725#issuecomment-1119243314","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/9725","id":1119243314,"node_id":"IC_kwDOClTkms5Ctkwy","user":{"login":"zhongjiajie","id":15820530,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODIwNTMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15820530?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie","html_url":"https://github.com/zhongjiajie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-06T04:10:27Z","updated_at":"2022-05-06T04:10:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Looking great!
