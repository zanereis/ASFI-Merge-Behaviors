You can add it for producer and consumer for now. but if the schema is used in somewhere else in the future, we have to end up adding the setting across the codebase. It is really hard to maintain.\r\n\r\n> In addition to the Javadoc which is still missing and the discussion on wether to have it as a wrapper or as an option, it would be good to have a description of how this Schema is going to be used (eg: the \"motivation\" for adding it).\r\n\r\n@tuteng can update those once we reach an agreement on this pull request.\r\n\r\n1.
