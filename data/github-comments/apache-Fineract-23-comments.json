 final int TOTAL_SUM to be changed to final int totalSum\r\n\r\nor you can make it `final static int TOTAL_SUM`, right? Then it's happy - and that's better.\r\n\r\nFYI in Java, as far as I know, always making all constants `final static` is much better than only `final`, because this saves memory... a `final static` is defined only ONCE in the Class, but a `final` is stored in every INSTANCE of said Class (I think, at least that's probably how it was originally; perhaps nowadays that gets optimized?). For a Test or Service class this doesn't matter (as there is typically only 1 instance of `YourService` or `SomethingTest`), but for a \"domain\" class of which there are N in production at run-time, this could make a real difference. For consistency, the rule of always making all constants `static final` seems sensible, to me - and is a very widely used pseudo standard convention in Java anyway.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/640209687/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/640211912","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/943#issuecomment-640211912","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/943","id":640211912,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MDIxMTkxMg==","user":{"login":"vorburger","id":298598,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODU5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/298598?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger","html_url":"https://github.com/vorburger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-07T12:33:49Z","updated_at":"2020-06-07T12:33:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> What I removed from .epf is correct(doubtful about end part)\r\n\r\nI'm struggling to (easily) see the diff in the .epf, because you've included all changed .java files again (by mistake?), can you remove those, and keep that local, to make both my review and the eventual merge easier?

I found /instance/org.eclipse.jdt.ui/org.eclipse.jdt.ui.importorder=java;javax;org;com; It seems something is wrong, should we be doing it alphabetically(Also as in checkstyle) , and also consider -> import io.* type too?\r\n\r\nYes you are right we want pure alphabetical import order, no grouping or java first... but I'm confused, where did you find `org.eclipse.jdt.ui.importorder=java;javax;org;com` ? https://github.com/apache/fineract/blob/develop/config/fineractdev-eclipse-preferences.epf#L463 has `/instance/org.eclipse.jdt.ui/org.eclipse.jdt.ui.importorder=;` and https://github.com/apache/fineract/blob/develop/fineract-provider/config/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml#L64 has `<module name=\"CustomImportOrder\"> <property name=\"thirdPartyPackageRegExp\" value=\".*\"/> <property name=\"sortImportsInGroupAlphabetically\" value=\"true\"/>` which to me seems right, that's what we want - agreed?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/640211912/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/640212513","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/943#issuecomment-640212513","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/943","id":640212513,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MDIxMjUxMw==","user":{"login":"thesmallstar","id":42006277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMDA2Mjc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42006277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar","html_url":"https://github.com/thesmallstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-07T12:37:18Z","updated_at":"2020-06-07T12:38:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@vorburger sorry I don't understand what do you mean by java files? \r\nI see 6 file changes and none of them are .java?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/640212513/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/640213378","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/943#issuecomment-640213378","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/943","id":640213378,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MDIxMzM3OA==","user":{"login":"thesmallstar","id":42006277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMDA2Mjc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42006277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar","html_url":"https://github.com/thesmallstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-07T12:43:12Z","updated_at":"2020-06-07T12:43:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Also, I don't see Google-checks?

I haven't looked very closely, but what Error Prone seems to raise here is that the code seems to forget to handle certain cases of enum values, right? \r\n\r\nFor example, in `AccountNumberFormatDataValidator`'s `determineValidAccountNumberPrefixes()` it does not handle an `EntityAccountType` of type `SHARES`. By just putting `default:` everywhere, we're just... \"shutting it up\" - agreed? Is that really right? I don't understand enough of the functionality, but it seems to me that code is missing handling of certain... new configurations, or something. \r\n\r\nI believe a better fix may be to add e.g. `case SHARES:` (etc.) and then... \"do the appropriate thing\". Or, perhaps at least `LOG.error(\"TODO Implement ValidAccountNumberPrefixes for SHARES\")` etc. kind of thing?\r\n\r\n@thesmallstar @ptuomola thought this code quality related discussion may interest you - feel free to chime in.

If I've understood this correctly, the current logic works like this: \r\n\r\nIf we call getOutputTemplateLocation() before the import processing has completed, then we get the location where Fineract has stored the import document - not the output document! Only after the processing has completed, the same API call returns the output document location - but we have no way of knowing when the processing is ready. \r\n\r\nPersonally I think that's not a great design of an API - to put it nicely :-). I hope I've missed something, but the testing seems to confirm this behaviour. \r\n\r\nSo I can see a couple of options: \r\n\r\n1. Accept the Thread.sleep of 10 seconds in the integration tests\r\n2. Implement some logic that repeatedly calls the API and tries to guess from the filename whether the processing has completed. But that might introduce flakiness...\r\n3. Rework the entire API logic e.g. to return 204 No content if called before the processing has completed\r\n\r\nPersonally I think #3 would be the right way to solve this, but not sure what clients will be broken by this. Maybe I should install the community app and see how that deals with this...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/640267243/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/640270084","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/980#issuecomment-640270084","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/980","id":640270084,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MDI3MDA4NA==","user":{"login":"vorburger","id":298598,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODU5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/298598?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger","html_url":"https://github.com/vorburger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-07T19:48:04Z","updated_at":"2020-06-07T19:48:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Or

In this way, when some adds a new value for the enum, they are also forced by Error Prone to think about the handling for that case.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, there are both types of cases:\r\n\r\n- We can argue that the default for account number prefix is that the account has no prefix, with specific cases then saying that specific types of accounts can have prefixes. So in this case a default of returning an empty list of prefixes makes sense.\r\n\r\n- But it doesn't make sense to that e.g. the default interest term is one month. Each interest term is different (one week, one month, one year) and there is no \"default\" we can assume will lead to a right behaviour. If we say that we use e.g. one month as default for everything we don't recognise, we will get wrong results for every new term that may be added. So in such case it makes sense to force the developer who adds a term to also add a new case in the routines that need to work on that term. \r\n\r\nJust my thoughts - happy to discuss...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/641687223/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/641702722","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/1016#issuecomment-641702722","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/1016","id":641702722,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MTcwMjcyMg==","user":{"login":"ptuomola","id":2398858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzOTg4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2398858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola","html_url":"https://github.com/ptuomola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-10T03:46:28Z","updated_at":"2020-06-10T03:46:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@xurror Unfortunately I doubt this will work: MySQL Connector does not support scrollable cursors, so setting ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE should have no impact. \r\n\r\nFrom MySQLConnector documentation: \r\nMySQL does not support SQL cursors, and the JDBC driver does not emulate them, so setCursorName() has no effect.\r\n\r\nI think we need to look at the job that fails and see what could lead to this... and why does Spring throw a TransientDataAccessException - some concurrency issue?

I found that a little surprising, as I would have expected a source code quality (formatting) tool to run BEFORE Gradle compiles Java. It would make the \"turn-around\" while developing slightly more efficient. If that's easy enough to change, perhaps it would be worth to still do that as part of this PR? Otherwise forget about it.\r\n\r\nI've also just realized that we forgot something (minor) here.. now that you've split the EPF, the respective paragraph in the README still needs to be updated to say that a developer must now manually import `config/fineractdev-cleanup.xml` and `config/fineractdev-formatter.xml` as well, agreed? You absolutely and totally should also explain in this doc update that the very same formatter XML one can use in the (Eclipse) IDE is also used by Spotless to BOTH validate the formatting AND to autoformat on the CLI - because that's actually really really cool, and very much worth pointing out explicitly.\r\n\r\n>  Travis is still failing though, some violations.\r\n\r\n@xurror that's totally expected, here... :smile_cat: I'll handle this.\r\n\r\nThe question now becomes when exactly we want to merge this (with a second commit, which I'll make, which will be the massive reformat). I think this kind of thing is \"big enough\" that an announcement, with a bit of time given, is appropriate. I'll post something to the dev list ASAP.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/642969559/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/642970820","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/998#issuecomment-642970820","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/998","id":642970820,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0Mjk3MDgyMA==","user":{"login":"nnatarajan","id":20606687,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjA2Njg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20606687?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nnatarajan","html_url":"https://github.com/nnatarajan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nnatarajan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nnatarajan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nnatarajan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nnatarajan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nnatarajan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nnatarajan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nnatarajan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nnatarajan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nnatarajan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-11T22:54:34Z","updated_at":"2020-06-11T22:55:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Created
