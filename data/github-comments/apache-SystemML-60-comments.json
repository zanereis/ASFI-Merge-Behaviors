Using ubuntu-latest could break reproducibility when new versions of ubuntu are added. I'd replace all calls to ubuntu-latest with ubuntu-22.04.\r\n\r\nSure we can make this change.\r\nPersonally i kind of like that we automatically keep up to date tho, but running both latest and 22.04 for all tests would be to much. If we can design it in such a way that all tests run on 22.04 and a subset (maybe applications only) run on latest then that would be cool, but only run the latest version if latest is different than 22.04.\r\n\r\nIn general that all seems like to much work compared to just having everything run on latest, also worth noting is that latest only update once every 2 years. so not a big concern in my opinion.\r\n\r\n> 2.

Retention period for artifacts, the uploaded test-coverage reports may be saved for up to 400 days as artifacts. I don't think they have a ton of value to keep around that long since they can also be regenerated.

@cluelesprogrammer ,\r\n\r\nYes the files are located correctly. \r\n\r\nNext steps are to (as we texted about before):\r\n\r\n1. Take a bit of inspiration from the other files, to define an interface of these methods such that you take an input X that you want to train on for the hmm.dml and a input X that you want to predict on for the hmmPredict.dml. As a starting point just make the methods call stop(\"NotImplemented\").\r\n2.

I've selected the timeit module to help make the times more reproducible since it lets us elegantly ignore setup in the recorded time and disable some sources of additional processing time like the garbage-collector in python. However, I wasn't sure if this is something you want. Are you on-board with this approach, or did you want more of a big-picture benchmark with all overhead included? \r\n2.  I've noticed that the conversions from numpy and pandas data is transferred lazily to SystemDS in the JVM. So, calling `from_numpy` and `from_pandas`, alone isn't letting me evaluate the real overhead. If you choose a big-picture benchmark above, I figure here I'd be stuck adding some sort of simple operator and calling compute or get_lineage to force the data to load. Another option would be to trick systemds into loading the data by creating an empty `DMLScript` and calling  the hidden internal `__prepare_script()` method because it has a bit less overhead than `get_lineage()`. This second option is what I'd prefer since it is more isolated, does it meet your needs?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/1596249203/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/1599926017","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/1847#issuecomment-1599926017","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1847","id":1599926017,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArxUbc5fXO8B","user":{"login":"Baunsgaard","id":9947148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5NDcxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9947148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard","html_url":"https://github.com/Baunsgaard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-21T01:16:54Z","updated_at":"2023-06-21T01:16:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> \r\n\r\n1.

I suggest that we keep to the lazy interface and do not add some new shortcut. Since again we have to keep in mind what is the usecase. And in this case it is a user script. They care about the entire thing with compiling and sending over the python script to java. Not only the data transfer. I understand this make it more inconclusive about where time is spend.

The current approach should meet the requirements for measuring the loading time for all of the options in python. It uses an option I'd noticed after writing my last comment, and I believe it keeps all relevant compilation steps while avoiding any extra operations after loading.\r\n\r\nIt sticks with timeit instead of switching to the time functions, which I think continues to add a benefit without much added complexity. Looking at timeit benchmark scripts may first give the impression of an antipattern since the to be measured code is written in strings, but it seems to be the pythonic way.\r\n\r\nThere are a few things I see left for me to do:\r\n\r\n- [x] figure out why the pandas benchmark is hanging\r\n- [x] make the log/stdout match the style used in the other perftest scripts\r\n- [ ] ~~add an input option for the binary data format instead of csv~~\r\n- [x] wrap a DML script in bash which allows the user to choose a number of run times and pass a csv ~~/binary~~ file\r\n- [ ] ~~choose a variety of generated input data~~\r\n- [x] call all of the benchmark scripts in one bash script similar to the other perftest benchmarks.\r\n\r\nThat leaves me with a few more things to check with you before I complete the above tasks.\r\n- Do the timeit benchmarks I've created so far cover all of the use-cases you had in mind?\r\n- You asked for a variety of data-types when we started the ticket, I'd have expected that to mean floats vs ints vs strings vs doubles and so on. However, I've noticed that the systemds docs describe Frame, Matrix and Scalars as the primary data-types. So, I assume that you also meant only Frames and Matrices as the significant data-types to be tested?\r\n- Initially I'd planned on writing some of my own data-generation scripts, but I noticed the existing generic one [scripts/utils/generateData.dml](https://github.com/apache/systemds/blob/main/scripts/utils/generateData.dml) and didn't see much value in creating a similar one. However, I am also considering adding a few extra runs using some of the generation scripts in scripts/perftest/datagen or scripts/datagen, but am not sure if that is in scope of the initial ticket. What do you think, is the use of the existing datagen what you were expecting?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/1606026498/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/1606051393","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/1847#issuecomment-1606051393","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1847","id":1606051393,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArxUbc5fumZB","user":{"login":"kykrueger","id":7158199,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNTgxOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7158199?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kykrueger","html_url":"https://github.com/kykrueger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kykrueger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kykrueger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kykrueger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kykrueger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kykrueger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kykrueger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kykrueger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kykrueger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kykrueger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-25T11:39:10Z","updated_at":"2023-06-25T11:39:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Baunsgaard \r\nInitially I'd thought there was a problem with my benchmark for loading data with pandas, but it seems that the script runs correctly, and that the converter for pandas to frames cannot handle loading large datasets in a reasonable amount of time, am I mistaken, is this a known problem?\r\n\r\nIm pretty sure I could come up with an easy fix for it by extending Py4JConverterUtils to take some sort of array format directly from pandas or dumping the pandas columns to numpy to reuse part of the existing ones from the Matrices.

It runs the operators on two randomly generated double matrices of a predefined size. In my example, I took the average of 25 computations with random matrices. The time was taken using javas `Instant.now()` and then calculated as milli seconds, which were stored in a LongSummaryStatistics object to compute averages etc.:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        Instant start = Instant.now();\r\n        mb1.binaryOperations(op, mb2, ret);\r\n        Instant finish = Instant.now();\r\n        long timeElapsed = Duration.between(start, finish).toMillis();\r\n        timeStatistics.accept(timeElapsed);\r\n```\r\nAs described [here](https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/1849#issuecomment-1606228945), the tool can be found [in this repo](https://github.com/louislepage/systemds-boolean-matrix-evaluation). It should be public. \r\n\r\nThe main reason for this approach is that I did not yet want to add full support for boolean matrices since I can not tell if that might break things in other places. \r\nHowever, I think it should be fine to use boolean matrices whenever running unsafeBinary with operators that are Comparision functions. If the data of dense blocks are only accessed using the get() functions, we can always return the double versions of the boolean values there to maintain compatibility with the FP64 implementation.

For each given matrix size, it does five computations with pseudo-randomly generated matrices for double to boolean operators and for boolean to boolean operators. \r\nBoth the total runtime of each operation and the memory used are stored. Finally, the average over the five runs is taken.\r\nThe Matrix sizes are chosen to represent up to 16mio total entries, but with different dims. We used square matrices of up to 4000x4000 and non-square ones of up to 100x160000. In the non-square case, one dimension was always fixed to a length of 100.\r\n\r\n## Evaluation of Double to Bool (GreaterThan)\r\nAs input, two dense FP64 Matrices are randomly generated based on a given seed. As the output, a MatrixBlock with a DenseBlock of the desired type (FP64, Bitset, or BooleanArray) is created.\r\nThe timer is started, the operator called with the two input and the output matrices, the timer is stopped, and the result matrix is returned for validation. Memory is computed as the difference between the memory used before the in- and output matrices are created and after the result is computed (but before any Matrix blocks were dereferenced).\r\n\r\n![matrix_operations_DoubeToBool_large](https://github.com/apache/systemds/assets/66960491/823a061e-a7b7-4dbc-9127-61105edab9a7)\r\n\r\nThe plot shows the runtimes on the left and memory usage on the right. In blue, the results of the bitset implementation are plotted. In green is the current Double/FP64 implementation, and in orange is the Boolean Array implementation. The different markers represent the results of square (square marker), Nx100 (circle), and 100xN (cross) matrices.\r\n\r\nAs expected, both runtime and memory usage increase linearly with an increased number of entries in the matrix.\r\n\r\nThe results show a visible performance increase for computation regarding runtime when using BooleanArray.  This is most likely due to faster, direct access to the smaller arrays and fewer translations between boolean results and their double representation to store them in the result matrix since the operators can return boolean values, which can then be directly stored in the result matrices.\r\nInterestingly the boolean array outperforms the Bitset here. The Bitset was even slower than the FP64 implementation. Without further investigation, this is probably due to fewer instructions necessary to access the boolean array compared to more when storing a value in a bitset. Also, it is worth noting that the bitset stores the values internally as `long` and therefore has to access an 8bytes large long whenever accessing a value. This might influence caching.\r\n\r\nRegarding memory, both boolean implementations took less space. As expected, the Bitset takes even less space since each boolean in the boolean arrays still takes up one byte, but the bitset stores the booleans as individual bits that are collected into `long`.\r\n\r\nThere is no difference in runtime or memory when using non-square matrices as long as the total number of entires is the same.\r\n\r\n## Evaluation of Boolen To Boolean (Xor)\r\nAs input, two dense Matrices of the given type (FP64, Bitset, or BooleanArray) with boolean values are randomly generated based on a given seed. As the output, a MatrixBlock with a DenseBlock of the desired type is created.\r\nThe timer is started, and the operator is called with the two input and the output matrices in a loop for 20 iterations. The timer is stopped, and the result matrix is returned for validation. Memory is computed as the difference between the memory used before the in- and output matrices are created and after the loop ended (but before any Matrix blocks were dereferenced).\r\n\r\n![matrix_operations_BoolToBool_large](https://github.com/apache/systemds/assets/66960491/1a456f04-2092-40b6-a018-4189beb83256)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe plot shows the runtimes on the left and memory usage on the right. In blue, the results of the bitset implementation are plotted. In green is the current Double/FP64 implementation, and in orange is the Boolean Array implementation. The different markers represent the results of square (square marker), Nx100 (circle), and 100xN (cross) matrices.\r\n\r\nAs expected, an improved runtime for the boolean arrays is also visible in this case and both runtime and memory usage increase linearly with an increased number of entries in the matrix.\r\n\r\nWe can also see an improvement in memory usage when using a boolean implementation. \r\nThe memory used is less than when running the Double to Boolean operator, even when using FP64, but this is probably due to reusing the result matrix as input to the next computation. Therefore after the first iteration, there are only two matrices in memory. \r\n\r\nMemory usage for the Boolean to Boolean case, when using actual Booleans as input, has decreased significantly since all matrices in memory are small, not only the output matrix. It is also visible that the bitset again outperforms the boolean array regarding memory usage.\r\n\r\nThere is no difference in runtime or memory when using non-square matrices as long as the total number of entries is the same.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion:\r\nSince both boolean implementations improve memory usage, but only the boolean array outperforms the FP64 implementation in runtime, I suggest using the boolean array as the DenseBlock for any operation that results in only boolean data.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet me know if there are any further open questions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/1615848526/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/1616785050","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/1849#issuecomment-1616785050","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1849","id":1616785050,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArxUbc5gXi6a","user":{"login":"Baunsgaard","id":9947148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5NDcxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9947148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard","html_url":"https://github.com/Baunsgaard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-02T19:26:18Z","updated_at":"2023-07-02T19:26:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Have you tried pop count on the bit set for the sum operation?

That could also open some doors to sharing a folder and common naming for the test-data-sets in order to reuse the same cached data-set between tests. \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/1617683924/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/1618996246","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/1848#issuecomment-1618996246","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1848","id":1618996246,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArxUbc5gf-wW","user":{"login":"thaivd1309","id":58191204,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MTkxMjA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58191204?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaivd1309","html_url":"https://github.com/thaivd1309","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaivd1309/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaivd1309/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaivd1309/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaivd1309/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaivd1309/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaivd1309/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaivd1309/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaivd1309/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaivd1309/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-03T18:43:01Z","updated_at":"2023-07-03T18:43:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I added static methods call for Affine and ReLU.

This should speed up the bit set significantly for sum.\r\n\r\nI did look into how some operators would probably have a speedup when using bitset because they can be performed on the entire bitset and not value by value. \r\n`OR`, `AND`, and `XOR` are also candidates for this (e.g.  [`BitSet.or(BitSet bitset)`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/BitSet.html#or-java.util.BitSet-). \r\nBut, it would mean a reimplementation of all of these operators. And a mechanism to decide when to use value by value and when Bitset on Bitset.\r\n\r\nHowever, the GraterThan and other Comparison Functions were already slower for bitset , than when run on FP64, and these have to run value by value. This would mean that one would need a dynamic typing mechanism to decide during runtime which kind of boolean denseblock would be most beneficial for the upcoming operations. I doubt that translating from boolean array to bitset and vice-versa for each operation would be worth it.\r\n\r\n@phaniarnab and I discussed this briefly in a meeting but came to the result, that in the end, there should be only one kind of boolean array implementation for now.\r\n\r\nTherefore I proposed the boolean array since it seems to have some speedup over all operators while using the same value-by-value operations as the FP64 implementation did. It would provide a speedup while being _backward-compatible_ with the current operator implementation, so to say.\r\n\r\nBut I agree that there most certainly are situations where bitset could be significantly faster.\r\n\r\nI think that having both boolean implementations and deciding at runtime what should be used would be very interesting, but for now, I do not understand systemds well enough to confidently say if this would be feasible and how complex this would be.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/1619985178/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/1620027636","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/1857#issuecomment-1620027636","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1857","id":1620027636,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArxUbc5gj6j0","user":{"login":"OlgaOvcharenko","id":44943723,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0OTQzNzIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44943723?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OlgaOvcharenko","html_url":"https://github.com/OlgaOvcharenko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OlgaOvcharenko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OlgaOvcharenko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OlgaOvcharenko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OlgaOvcharenko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OlgaOvcharenko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OlgaOvcharenko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OlgaOvcharenko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OlgaOvcharenko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OlgaOvcharenko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-04T10:57:30Z","updated_at":"2023-07-04T10:57:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> I don't fully understand the use case of a ragged array-based frame.

you restart the pipeline once? \r\nI think a couple of errors are due to issues with spark and caching and might not be directly code related.\r\n\r\nI cannot replicate the errors locally and do not

would be very grateful for any tips.\r\nThanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/1625173566/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
