So it seems that a fallout of a race on 'isEmpty' would be that we do another poll waiting for the flush to complete. \r\n\r\nAlso, in the test failure, we were transitioning to `ABORTABLE_ERROR` because the batches expired when sitting in the queue.

Thanks for the patch. LGTM. \r\n\r\nOne thing not directly related to the patch. It seems that when we delete the old segments, we don't change ProducerIdEntry.currentTxnFirstOffset. This means that ProducerIdEntry.currentTxnFirstOffset may no long be in the log. Not sure if this matters, but it probably means that ProducerIdEntry.currentTxnFirstOffset may be recovered inconsistently depending on whether the snapshot exists or not.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/308751638/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/308756445","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/3351#issuecomment-308756445","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/3351","id":308756445,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwODc1NjQ0NQ==","user":{"login":"asfgit","id":1341245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDEyNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1341245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit","html_url":"https://github.com/asfgit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-15T14:48:30Z","updated_at":"2017-06-15T14:48:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nRefer

I've been procrastinating on this patch this evening and I think it's because I'm not too satisfied with the solution. I've been thinking of an alternative. The current problem is that we sort of stupidly assume that no snapshot implies upgrade and we're now trying to clear several hurdles to make that assumption work. Perhaps we can just strengthen the upgrade check. In addition to having no snapshot file, maybe we can look at the message format version of the last batch appended to the log. If the version is old, we can skip rebuilding the producer state. This of course depends on the assumption that users won't downgrade the message format version, but we assume that in the fetch handler anyway, so it seems fine.
