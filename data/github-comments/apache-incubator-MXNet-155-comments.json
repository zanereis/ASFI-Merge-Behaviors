Several comments:\r\n\r\n1. The handling of init states is much better than the previous ad hoc way. However, I guess the user needs to re-construct the symbol, instead of just loading from json, in order to do inference, because the init states will be feeded inputs, instead of mx.zeros. Is there some way to make this easier?\r\n\r\n2. The current interface handle time steps as a list, by using `SliceChannel` to split and later on re-merge. I'm wondering if there is a performance issue here (e.g. for applications with ~2k sequence length). Would it be better to use a fully packed tensor, and making one of the dimension as the time? (i.e. time-major / batch-major data layout). The benefit is also that cuDNN cell uses this layout, so it might be easier to wrap. Another benefit is that symbolically, an RNN with seq-len 10 and seq-len 20 will be exactly the same, except binded with different input shapes.\r\n\r\n3. Currently there seem to be simple one layer RNN cell and then sequential RNN cell that could contain a stack of RNN cells. I'm wondering do we need to expose many different concepts to the user. With commonly used wrappers, for both the [tensorflow interface](https://keras.io/layers/recurrent/) and the [theano interface](https://lasagne.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/layers/recurrent.html), the RNN cell is a single function that could be used to create multiple layers with a single call. Plus, it can be mixed with other operators, without needing to explicitly call unroll. Our own [cuDNN RNN Cell demo](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/master/example/rnn-time-major/rnn_cell_demo.py#L101) is an example that I think is kind of keeping the syntax as close as calling other mxnet operator.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/275297422/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/275297514","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/4783#issuecomment-275297514","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/4783","id":275297514,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NTI5NzUxNA==","user":{"login":"PhanTask","id":13670242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjcwMjQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13670242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhanTask","html_url":"https://github.com/PhanTask","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhanTask/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhanTask/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhanTask/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhanTask/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhanTask/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhanTask/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhanTask/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhanTask/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhanTask/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-26T03:01:32Z","updated_at":"2017-01-26T03:01:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@d4wud

For one dimension shape (such as cuDNN parameters), the key is using sqrt to 'mimic' two dimension shape, which has been verified as an effective method by test.\r\n\r\n#4644 proposes an initializer registeration mechanism to adapt with various situations, which is compatible with RNNXavier that I introduced in rnn_cell_demo.py. But #4644 itself cannot resolve the 'LSTM_bias' defect. \r\n\r\nI think you can accept this PR firstly, then merge #4644, after that I can revise rnn_cell_demo.py again to use your registeration mechanism (of course, as a custom initializer in user side, it also may not need to register).\r\n\r\nBesides, bucket_io.py revised to be compatible with python 3.x. Otherwise the program exit
