since we are trying to replace one of them\r\n* `NOT` is good; but has no effect on \"UNKNOWN\"\r\n* `CASE`, `AND`, `OR`, `COALESCE` .... adds much more complexity\r\n\r\nI think it's not possible to give a an `F` in this case; which might be better.\r\n\r\nSo I think the existing 4 is all what we can do right now; I'm considering adding something like the following as a comment:\r\n\r\n`UnknownAs.FALSE` corresponds to `x IS TRUE`\r\n`UnknownAs.TRUE` to `x IS NOT FALSE`\r\n\r\nNote that both `UnknownAs.TRUE` and `UnknownAs.FALSE` only changes the meaning of `Unknown`\r\n\r\n* if we are already in `UnknownAs.FALSE` mode; `x IS TRUE` can be simiplified to `x` without any side effects\r\n* similarily  in `UnknownAs.TRUE` mode ; `x IS NOT FALSE` can be simplified to `x`\r\n* `x IS FALSE` could be rewritten to `(NOT x) IS TRUE` and from there the 1. rule applies\r\n* `x IS NOT TRUE` can be rewritten to `(NOT x) IS NOT FALSE` and from there the 2. rule applies\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/463818974/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/464091696","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/998#issuecomment-464091696","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/998","id":464091696,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NDA5MTY5Ng==","user":{"login":"vlsi","id":213894,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzg5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/213894?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi","html_url":"https://github.com/vlsi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-15T15:32:07Z","updated_at":"2019-02-15T15:32:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@o0lwj0o , \r\n\r\n>The other potential problem is that Java implement autoboxing and unboxing since JDK 1.5.
