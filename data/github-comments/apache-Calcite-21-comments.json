Please don't force push. It's difficult to tell which issues you have addressed. Add commits.\r\n\r\nNote that I questioned why there was an extra `min` function, and 4 days later @hsyuan noticed the same problem.\r\n\r\nI'm going to repeat my earlier suggestion, in case it was missed:\r\n\r\n>I think it might be better if RelBuilder is responsible for turning DISTINCT off. Meanwhile AggregateCall should throw if AggregateCall.distinct is true and getDistinctOptionality() is not OPTIONAL.\r\n\r\nThis would simplify a lot of things. We simply wouldn't allow people to create an AggregateCall to MIN with distinct=true. If they use RelBuilder, they get this automatically; otherwise they have to turn off distinct before they create AggregateCall. It's consistent with how we do things elsewhere - be very strict about types etc. in RelNode/RexNode land.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/520085174/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/520202981","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/1333#issuecomment-520202981","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/1333","id":520202981,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMDIwMjk4MQ==","user":{"login":"jinxing64","id":4058918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNTg5MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4058918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64","html_url":"https://github.com/jinxing64","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-11T06:04:53Z","updated_at":"2019-08-11T06:04:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@hsyuan

This is a large contribution, thanks for your effort. My only concern is that should we provide the option of implicit cast strategy or dialect? Different databases has some different cast strategy. like '9'/2, PostgreSQL will cast '9' to integer, which returns 4, while Hive may cast '9' to decimal, which returns 4.5. The current implementation will break many Postgres queries, and generate wrong results.\r\n\r\nI think we can, because the `TypeCoercion` can see the `SqlValidator` then the `SqlConformance`, but i can not find a conformance of POSTGRES now. There are 2 choices:\r\n1. Add a conformance for `POSTGRE`\r\n2. disable the whole type coercion when doing `POSTGRE` query\r\n\r\nIt seems that only PostgreSQL has this behavior so i choose 1 and add use the conformance to control the behavior.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/521902508/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/521908675","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/1354#issuecomment-521908675","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/1354","id":521908675,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMTkwODY3NQ==","user":{"login":"danny0405","id":7644508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NDQ1MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7644508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405","html_url":"https://github.com/danny0405","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-16T07:02:12Z","updated_at":"2019-08-16T07:02:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks so much for the review @hsyuan , i'm preparing for the design doc, which should be in front of the PR first, sorry for that, the doc is ready soon.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/521908675/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/522151834","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/1385#issuecomment-522151834","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/1385","id":522151834,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMjE1MTgzNA==","user":{"login":"julianhyde","id":1130553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzA1NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1130553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde","html_url":"https://github.com/julianhyde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-16T21:07:36Z","updated_at":"2019-08-16T21:07:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Please change the description \"Need to...\" is not accurate.

\r\nThanks for your kind reminder.\r\n\r\nActually I think this case can be covered by https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/1384\r\nThe matching pattern proposed in this PR is like below:\r\n```\r\n   query:   Project(projects: [$0, *(2, $1)])\r\n                   Aggregate(groupSet: {0}, groupSets: [{0}], calls: [SUM($1)])\r\n                     Scan(table: [hr, emps])\r\n    target:

matching pattern proposed in https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/1384 is like below:\r\n```\r\n query:   Project(projects: [$0, +($1, 2)])\r\n                 Project(projects: [$1, $3, $4])\r\n
