@abhishekagarwal87 I am still going over all your comments and I will think through them thoroughly and I am welcome to incorporate everything that makes this better. However, one thing I would like to suggest is that we try to gather requirements and identify the best possible solution for all of those requirements, rather than simply trying to fit some of the existing KafkaSpout's solutions into this KafkaSpout. There are a lot of design decisions I don't agree with in the previous KafkaSpout that among other things made the code very complex and verbose. We should use the previous code to identify requirements, but we shouldn't simply follow it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/197979792/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/198013271","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1226#issuecomment-198013271","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1226","id":198013271,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5ODAxMzI3MQ==","user":{"login":"redsanket","id":8295799,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyOTU3OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8295799?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket","html_url":"https://github.com/redsanket","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-17T18:18:52Z","updated_at":"2016-03-17T18:18:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"+1\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/198013271/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612886369","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/5471#issuecomment-2612886369","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/5471","id":2612886369,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI4ODYzNjk=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-17T18:18:54Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T16:08:30Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a
