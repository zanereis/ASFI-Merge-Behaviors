can you post a 'summary' of the results when you post this.  I don't want to have to download each of these files to know that they ran successfully.  Can you just say something like \"CI Passed\" or something like that?  \"Here are the results\" without telling me if it is a success for failure requires me to download and review every file.  I understand from your \"dont bother with\" comment that everything passed except that, but if you can just let me know that status, that will help me.  Thanks for testing this.  👍

Why list tests are taking so long?\nSome observations:\n- Tests are not tagged, please tag them (refer to existing tests). I ran them in a simulator setup and they passed so these can be added to Travis once the overall time is reduced and proper tags added\n- Templates created as part of tests is not cleaned up.\n- time.sleep(720). I saw the comment about vm snapshot issue, better to disable the vm snapshot test and enable it once snapshot issue is fixed\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/217789291/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/217791958","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1523#issuecomment-217791958","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1523","id":217791958,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNzc5MTk1OA==","user":{"login":"nlivens","id":3336539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzY1Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3336539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlivens","html_url":"https://github.com/nlivens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlivens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlivens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlivens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlivens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlivens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlivens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlivens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlivens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlivens/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-09T07:15:03Z","updated_at":"2016-05-09T07:15:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@DaanHoogland,
