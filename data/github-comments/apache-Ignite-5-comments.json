thanks for continuing the review. I don't think we have a lot of option with the `DEFAULT_DATABASE` naming, as it is used internally by Spark whenever you do not specify the name of the schema in Spark SQL. Ie. you can run the first test case in `IgniteCatalogSpec` and see that Spark passes `default` as the schema name through to the `listTables()` operation - so I believe this is a Spark limitation as I'm not aware of any way to change the value of `DEFAULT_DATABASE`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/comments/427782678/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/comments/428226067","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ignite/pull/4869#issuecomment-428226067","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/4869","id":428226067,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyODIyNjA2Nw==","user":{"login":"zaleslaw","id":1198621,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTg2MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1198621?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaleslaw","html_url":"https://github.com/zaleslaw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaleslaw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaleslaw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaleslaw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaleslaw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaleslaw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaleslaw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaleslaw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaleslaw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaleslaw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-09T14:57:40Z","updated_at":"2018-10-09T14:57:40Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Please
