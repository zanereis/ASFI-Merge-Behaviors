TypedRead/TypedWrite achieves that.

The first two fail because of a pretty fundamental problem: Flink batch does not allow emission of null values from inputs or user operations (except in some corner cases). The `PAssert` tests rely on this behavior of Beam to work.\n\nIn one of the commits I removed the special TypeSerializer for VoidCoder and also our special implementation of Create in favor of the `CreateSource`. Before, we got away by always intercepting the VoidCoder and wrapping it in a TypeSerializer that would always emit a VoidValue instead of a proper null. This way, we could emit \"null values\" from our special implementation of `Create`. If the user fn reads these, this will not be consistent with how it should behave, however. I also had to disable our (weirdly named) `MaybeEmptyTestITCase` because of this.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/217463803/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/217468458","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/274#issuecomment-217468458","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/274","id":217468458,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNzQ2ODQ1OA==","user":{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-06T15:08:32Z","updated_at":"2016-05-06T15:08:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mxm Thanks for the review!

A made the nulls in `PAssert` into ints. They are just dummy values and there is no need to deal with null support just to get tests working.\n2. Allow assertion errors to surface via `TestFlinkPipelineRunner`. My code there is definitely not a good idea, just a hack. In the other existing runners this happens a little differently: all invocations of user code are protected and wrapped in a `UserCodeException` which then surfaces and is unwrapped to the original exception. Then `PAssertTest` just catches the original exception.\n3. Added the first bit of filtering based on the capability matrix, to exclude tests that require windowing that is not supported.\n\nIncidentally, running this on my desktop I'm often getting `Insufficient number of network buffers: required 12, but only 11 available. The total number of network buffers is currently set to 2048. You can increase this number by setting the configuration key 'taskmanager.network.numberOfBuffers'\"`. I haven't spent any time looking into this, but perhaps there is a default that should go into the pom?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/217544721/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/217560666","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/296#issuecomment-217560666","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/296","id":217560666,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNzU2MDY2Ng==","user":{"login":"mshields822","id":11642236,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjQyMjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11642236?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mshields822","html_url":"https://github.com/mshields822","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mshields822/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mshields822/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mshields822/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mshields822/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mshields822/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mshields822/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mshields822/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mshields822/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mshields822/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-06T21:17:06Z","updated_at":"2016-05-06T21:17:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM\nMuch

better.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/217899983/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/217912645","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/303#issuecomment-217912645","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/303","id":217912645,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNzkxMjY0NQ==","user":{"login":"lukecwik","id":10078956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDc4OTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10078956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik","html_url":"https://github.com/lukecwik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-09T16:18:39Z","updated_at":"2016-05-09T16:18:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"LGTM\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/217912645/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/217915398","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/305#issuecomment-217915398","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/305","id":217915398,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNzkxNTM5OA==","user":{"login":"dhalperi","id":526415,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNjQxNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/526415?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi","html_url":"https://github.com/dhalperi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-09T16:28:54Z","updated_at":"2016-05-09T16:28:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/217915398/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/217918023","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/306#issuecomment-217918023","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/306","id":217918023,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNzkxODAyMw==","user":{"login":"lukecwik","id":10078956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDc4OTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10078956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik","html_url":"https://github.com/lukecwik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-09T16:38:31Z","updated_at":"2016-05-09T16:38:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"LGTM\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/217918023/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comme

thing that we need to consider: [null values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare#Apologies_and_retractions) are a language-specific concept. The language-agnostic conception is really \"PCollection containing elements encoded with `VoidCoder`\". In modern type systems, \"PCollection of `VoidCoder`\" would be interpreted as a collection of `Unit` or `()` since it is actually a type with a single inhabitant, not a type with zero inhabitants.\n\nMore broadly, as long as a user can provide a `Coder<T>` for their `PCollection<T>` the runner should mostly be agnostic of `T`, except for special types that primitive operations need to understand. In this narrow case, each SDK instantiates `VoidCoder` as appropriate to invoke a `DoFn` written in that language.\n\nSo it may be more appropriate to have the behavior you mentioned before, where the Flink runner notices the use of root level `VoidCoder` and box the values as needed to run it on Flink, unboxing when a `DoFn` is invoked.
