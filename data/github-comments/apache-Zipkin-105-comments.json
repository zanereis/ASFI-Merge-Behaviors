Having an optional additional link that users can configure could be useful, but seems like a separate decision. I don't know of any other monitoring tool that offers such a feature and if they did, I'm sure they wouldn't let it replace links to their own website, and I don't think we should either, again for purposes of attribution/recognition of the open source project. If people really want to replace something like that, they can fork the project like they would have to for other open source monitoring tools. Just my feelings on it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/596163376/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/596164454","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/2375#issuecomment-596164454","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2375","id":596164454,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NjE2NDQ1NA==","user":{"login":"anuraaga","id":198344,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5ODM0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/198344?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga","html_url":"https://github.com/anuraaga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-08T04:08:43Z","updated_at":"2020-03-08T04:08:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> I'm sure they wouldn't let it replace links to their own website, and I don't think we should either\r\n\r\nRight sorry for confusion meant the configurable help link could be in addition to the website link which would be static.\r\n\r\nFor reference, Grafana allows adding arbitrary links in various places including top level, and I've used it to tie together internal tools a little.

@adriancole - this might be a bit late. I read the need @ https://github.com/openzipkin/openzipkin.github.io/wiki/Favorite-trace.  Instead of a second cluster, one can have a second storage with higher retention and do scatter/gather on search. When someone does an explicit search for a traceid, move the trace to the second storage in the background. This allows the trace to still show up in the cluster and be available longer. Not sure if zipkin allows multiple storage DBs and scatter / gather on search - if it does, this might be easier than a second archive cluster from user perspective as saved links in jira or issues will continue to work as is.

I think for some setups an internal tiering could work. \r\n\r\nThere is additional configuration complexity to achieve that.. we don't have anything that could do that internally, especially as TTL is implemented differently (if defined at all). For example, in cassandra it is literally copying the rows again (to update the TTL). Also, much of the configuration would double to achieve the goal.. I think we've talked about this tension in the past. It gets more complex when storage is different schema or tech per tier. These decisions are mostly backend I think anyway, and this change is all frontend.\r\n\r\nIt is a very good point on readback/permalink, we do have a change here to allow a different URL. However, there's no requirement to use one. Ex yelp did what you said with scatter gather in the past https://github.com/drolando/zipkin-mux. We don't have to use a separate URL space for things explicitly saved, or otherwise tiered to a longer TTL. If we mount the UI assets so its /zipkin path is mounted against a proxy api, it will never know the difference.\r\n\r\nStepping back, this change is focused on is users being explicitly able to choose traces, which is possibly higher signal of interest than queries, albeit manually trained. Our UI saves data from the list screen to the trace detail. A trace id-specific api call never occurs in this flow, unless the user hit the trace link directly. In other words, a user who is discovering a trace from a list will show no side-effects to the backend that they are looking at one trace. Basically you'd have to assume that any queried data with no parameters except time imply interest, then push all those a tier down. I think this is something that could require tuning to avoid chattiness, because I would suspect many just hit refresh a lot. However, I agree even the wider net would be significantly smaller than all traces: time-based is better than pushing all traces a tier back.\r\n\r\nAutomatic tiering is nevertheless an interesting idea sites can consider... maybe this feature can help build tension needed to explore that. Meanwhile, they have a lot of options that are easy as pie.\r\n\r\nIn simplest case you can imagine someone who is already using our in-memory server, and wants to save off traces to ES or even a cloud provider (many accept zipkin format now). In the case of cassandra, re-posting to another cluster is similar impact to overwriting the same rows with a new TTL. TL;DR; In this design there's no constraint in which technologies are in use, hence very big bank for the buck.\r\n\r\nI'm very happy to hear about the story you mentioned though.. it is no doubt helpful for people to know existing practice! thanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/597465643/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/597476377","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/3014#issuecomment-597476377","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/3014","id":597476377,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NzQ3NjM3Nw==","user":{"login":"anuraaga","id":198344,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5ODM0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/198344?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga","html_url":"https://github.com/anuraaga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-11T07:05:08Z","updated_at":"2020-03-11T07:05:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Renamed from help -> support","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/597476377/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/597476608","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/3018#issuecomment-597476608","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/3018","id":597476608,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NzQ3NjYwOA==","user":{"login":"jcchavezs","id":3075074,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzUwNzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3075074?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcchavezs","html_url":"https://github.com/jcchavezs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcchavezs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcchavezs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcchavezs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcchavezs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcchavezs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcchavezs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcchavezs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcchavezs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcchavezs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-11T07:05:52Z","updated_at":"2020-03-11T07:05:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"My 2p: So if I am not wrong, this traces will be uploaded in a different\ninstance of zipkin (that is always the case, otherwise no point) hence\nthere is no way to mix normal spans from the archived ones, isn't?

The reason I think is that this change can feel very much like user-assisted late (after-the-fact or tail) sampling.\r\n\r\nEx for the same reasons @mchandramouli mentioned. @jeqo and others have discussed how automated late sampling can occur, ex by storing queries to the api. This led to a design idea  that a collector tier component would actually need to consider the entire trace. We had a couple initiatives to play with this including the [VoltDB experiment](https://github.com/adriancole/zipkin-voltdb) and a later more fleshed out [Kafka Streams](https://github.com/openzipkin-contrib/zipkin-storage-kafka) approach.\r\n\r\nWhat I'd recommend in this change is to be conscious that something like this could help train automation, the automation itself could be the POST endpoint here! That said, we can probably develop things around tail sampling separately, mentioning this for context and visa versa. I'm really happy that folks helped participate here.. I feel clearer about the boundaries and am glad we can have a tie-in for those who can setup a late sampling arch.\r\n\r\nWe do owe ourselves a combined wiki on late sampling though, as we do on other things. It is a bit difficult to hold the context of the various efforts together, so a volunteer to harvest some of this thread and others about late sampling into a design doc would be welcome https://github.com/openzipkin/openzipkin.github.io/wiki/Designs","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/597669419/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/597733334","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/3018#issuecomment-597733334","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/3018","id":597733334,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NzczMzMzNA==","user":{"login":"mchandramouli","id":148128,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODEyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/148128?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mchandramouli","html_url":"https://github.com/mchandramouli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mchandramouli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mchandramouli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mchandramouli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mchandramouli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mchandramouli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mchandramouli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mchandramouli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mchandramouli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mchandramouli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-11T16:26:46Z","updated_at":"2020-03-11T16:27:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> Automatic tiering is nevertheless an interesting idea sites can consider... maybe this feature can help build tension needed to explore that.

Main difference in simplification is that we are talking about 1+1 apis, not 1+N which I agree is more complex.\r\n\r\nAny logic about merging applies agree, but I don't think that and counts are complex when there are only 2 sources. Since only 2, conflict resolution logic to pick one trace instead of merging them. Also, if a problem that someone asked for 10 traces and somehow that period had overlap and some from archive, deciding which to throw out is something we can do predictably also (ex. the newest in that period, as we do in cassandra fan-outs in the backend). Concretely, if this is bound only to \"archive\" then it we get the luxury of simple conflict resolution.\r\n\r\nlookback isn't an issue really, where it matters is set on the backend. the lookback in lens is just about the default duration of the trace query. For example, you can override this now with 1970 as we do in our [testdata readme](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/tree/master/zipkin-lens/testdata)\r\n\r\nI think what I caused most confusion with was by mentioning OPTIONS and not explaining why. What I meant was that we can use OPTIONS to try to detect if the archiveUrl is a normal zipkin server, and then no logic happens at all if we know it not to be. That was just a simplication.. again all UI logic is exactly the same except the api handler, it is only moving the code in lua into javascript, which would have exactly the same concerns.\r\n\r\nThese clarifications don't imply I personally think we should do this, just want to help ease this topic  as I think path based would be even worse to do in our api as then it messes with internal routing logic, etc. easier for a proxy to just mount the other /zipkin under /zipkin-archive imho\r\n\r\nIn other words, if I have a vote, it is to do the least impact if we are to do something like this, and so far affecting the api javascript code only seems the least impact.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/597950960/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/597953717","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/3023#issuecomment-597953717","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/3023","id":597953717,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5Nzk1MzcxNw==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-12T00:59:21Z","updated_at":"2020-03-12T01:03:30Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Some real impacts of proxying regardless of lua or in-browser:\r\n\r\n## pollution of the service/span/auto-complete name list or a choice to prefer\r\n\r\nprobably one thing @jcchavezs implies is that if you merge names, maybe you don't want to use service-span names from a very long time ago.

Ex. one zipkin can set to \"1hr\" and another to \"7days\", they would have different URLS, possibly on the same host if using `basePath` and a dumb proxy.

Ex. one zipkin can set to \"1hr\" and another to \"7days\", they would have different URLS, possibly on the same host if using basePath and a dumb proxy.\r\n\r\n-> 2 different instances (active and archive) with `${archivePostPath}` feature to move traces between them.\r\n\r\n`environment` would be flexible enough to be used to differentiate active and archive instances--even though I've to confess I haven't used this feature before.\r\n\r\nI'd assume sites with this need will have an infrastructure big enough to justify running an archive instance in parallel.  \r\n\r\nAnother alternative that is appealing to me is to have this functionality as part of the storage API. This will involve supporting multiple storages plugged to the same instance (e.g. traces->elasticsearch, dependencies->elasticsearch, archive->cassandra). Thinking out loud, in this scenario I'd envision Lens having a query flag to lookup from traces or archive endpoint. It could even show archive/favorite traces as top results if we support to return results from both endpoints. \r\n\r\nDoing dual-read from Lens would be _too_ complex imho--following your comments above.

me.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/598467411/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/598480460","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2230#issuecomment-598480460","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2230","id":598480460,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5ODQ4MDQ2MA==","user":{"login":"jeqo","id":6180701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxODA3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6180701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeqo","html_url":"https://github.com/jeqo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeqo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeqo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeqo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeqo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeqo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeqo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeqo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeqo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeqo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-12T23:46:21Z","updated_at":"2020-03-12T23:46:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@adriancole
