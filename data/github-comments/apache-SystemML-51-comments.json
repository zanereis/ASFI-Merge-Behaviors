You can compile a proxy shared library, users specify the location of LLVM libraries via `-Djava.library.path`, and we try to dynamically load this library during runtime and fallback to java if unsuccessful.

The individual DAGs are delineated by conditional control flow and hence, there is only limited potential for doing CSE on sub-sequences of program blocks (and thus, DAGs). Doing CSE across control flow (e.g., across branches and loops) is possible but is not the first step for extensions. \r\n\r\nI would recommend to focus on a single DAG with commutative operations like `A + 7` and `7 + A`, which are currently only indirectly eliminated (for plus and add, but not for `max(A,B)` vs `max(B,A)`). There are approaches: (1) either introduce canonicalization rewrites that systematically order inputs (e.g., by hop ID) or (2) extend the actual CSE rewrite for consider such permutations. I would recommend approach (1) which would be best added to  `RewriteAlgebraicSimplificationDynamic` as this canonicalization rewrite would need to check for matrix sizes too as we only support broadcasting (e.g., matrix vector elementwise operations) on the right hand side. \r\n\r\nThe scope of operations could be: OpOpN - MIN, MAX, PLUS, as well as OpOp2 - AND, OR, XOR, COV, EQUAL, NOTEQUAL, MIN, MAX, PLUS, MULT, and potentially other comparisons but they additionally require modifications of the comparison operator on reordering.

If kept, please move the checks for min/max y inside the respective branch\r\n\r\nI think this is not intuitive, and should result in an error, where ppl should preprocess instead of relying on the function to fix it.\r\nIt is frustrating is that the 0'th label suddenly becomes the last label. this confused me with MNIST.\r\nalso this current implementation, and the main reason why i'm playing around with this, can contain more or less labels when calling predict.\r\n\r\nIf the dateset contains classes 1-5 but because of some reason the training data is only containing 1-4. then the model calling table creates values to classify into 4 labels, rather than the 5 intended originally. This sometimes happens if you slice in covtype, where sometime the last label is missing.\r\nMore common is in the predict call where if we call with a single data point, lets say label 3 then this same way of handling Y would not work because we end up with 3 columns instead of 5. The predict can be fixed by looking at the other arguments to the function but i would rather have the Y input match the input to training.\r\n\r\nThe most intuitive API here for me is: \r\n\r\nif 1 column -> onehot encode (don't change the negative or 0 values but stop execution if they are there)\r\nif more than one column -> assume one hot encoded and verify that all values are 0 or 1. ideally i would make this default and not allow 1 column inputs.\r\n\r\n>     * Remove the call `LT = decompress(LT)` (that is exactly why we should disable its use at script level other than in tests)\r\n\r\nUps, debugging code. \"classic\"\r\n\r\n>     * The isNaN(X) returns an empty block if there are no NaN (without allocation) - so it's overhead is actually very small.

I double checked the code... and you are right. it should not matter in the case where there is no NaN values. if there is some, then the rewrite is faster, but then the execution will crash anyway. With the rewrite i could avoid supporting Unary operations in compression, but i guess i will just have to add it.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/788323417/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/789310393","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/1183#issuecomment-789310393","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1183","id":789310393,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4OTMxMDM5Mw==","user":{"login":"corepointer","id":49227510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MjI3NTEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49227510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/corepointer","html_url":"https://github.com/corepointer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corepointer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corepointer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corepointer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corepointer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corepointer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corepointer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corepointer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corepointer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corepointer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-02T23:56:17Z","updated_at":"2021-03-02T23:56:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Testing training and validation would be out of scope of a unit test imho.
