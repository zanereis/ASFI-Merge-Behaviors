Obviously we can't guess all the variants that will be used realistically, but implementing these gives significant flexibility, e.g. to tune the deployment to have lots of small prewarm, plus a few large ones, etc. \r\n\r\nThe potential problem for multiple prewarms that vary by memory is that you may end up running \"small\" (memory footprint) actions on a \"large\" container, if you only test whether the action memory < prewarm memory. This may have some odd results, like creating many large footprint containers that are only used for small actions, and causing large actions to wait for cold starts. \r\n\r\nIt may be worthwhile to add another config property, like `minMemory` where the prewarm will ONLY be used if `prewarm.minMemory < action.limits.memory < prewarm.memory'. In this case, you could have a few large prewarms around, that will actually be reserved for running actions that are close in memory footprint requirements. \r\n\r\nIn the spirit of \"change it once\", this may be a good time to introduce action resource attributes as well. I think this is needed in actions so that, for example, an action can signal that it needs to run on a gpu host, or consumes a relatively large amount of cpu, etc. If an action can signal these, they will need to be configurations within the runtime manifest as well. This is a bigger change though, so may be worthwhile to settle for \"change it twice\"? I will open up an issue for this (if one doesn't exist)\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/384467242/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/384468570","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/3454#issuecomment-384468570","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/3454","id":384468570,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NDQ2ODU3MA==","user":{"login":"tysonnorris","id":1638396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzgzOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1638396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tysonnorris","html_url":"https://github.com/tysonnorris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tysonnorris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tysonnorris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tysonnorris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tysonnorris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tysonnorris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tysonnorris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tysonnorris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tysonnorris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tysonnorris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-25T23:49:37Z","updated_at":"2018-04-25T23:49:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"You could pretty easily change these from hard coded to system-wide configurations by setting them as default values on the `whisk.container-factory.container-args.extra-args` config:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/blob/d7c9fd661a8a5b339f20b3f549bfa4fa47124706/core/invoker/src/main/resources/application.conf#L55\r\n(and deleting the hard coded bits in InvokerReactive)\r\n\r\n\r\nTo do this per action may be weird though, since generally you will want to maintain some restrictions over args passed to `docker run`, I think. \r\n\r\nTo keep that control, but make it accessible, you might be able to add something like `extra-args` that are based on image name, so that you (as OW operator) can allow only some specific images to be launched with a different set of args.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/384468570/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/384469215","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/2401#issuecomment-384469215","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/2401","id":384469215,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NDQ2OTIxNQ==","user":{"login":"tysonnorris","id":1638396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzgzOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1638396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tysonnorris","html_url":"https://github.com/tysonnorris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tysonnorris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tysonnorris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tysonnorris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tysonnorris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tysonnorris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tysonnorris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tysonnorris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tysonnorris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tysonnorris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-25T23:53:55Z","updated_at":"2018-04-25T23:53:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think this will be addressed by #3232?

Based on usage following indexes are configured\r\n\r\n### Subjects\r\n\r\n* /uuid/? - Authentication query\r\n* /subject/?\r\n* /namespaces/[]/uuid/? - Authentication query\r\n* /namespaces/[]/name/?\r\n* /concurrentInvocations/? - For blacklist check query\r\n* /invocationsPerMinute/? - For blacklist check query\r\n\r\nKey points\r\n* Indexing mode is set to consistent\r\n* All indexes have precision set to -1 for now. Later based on metrics we can determine if this needs to be tweaked\r\n* `key` is not being indexed - Authentication query is performed on uuid and key. Of this index is only created for `uuid` and `key` check should be taken care by filtering in query evaluation. As `uuid` is very much unique number of rows scanned for filtering should be small\r\n* `concurrentInvocations` and `invocationsPerMinute` are used in \"namespace name/limits\" documents which are then used to find out blacklisted namespace if either of them is zero. We can possibly remove this by setting `blocked` to true even for limits docs\r\n\r\n### Whisks\r\n\r\n* /entityType/? - Hash\r\n* /namespace/? - Hash\r\n* /\\_c/rootns/? - Hash\r\n* /updated/? - Range\r\n\r\nKey points\r\n* Indexing mode set to consistent\r\n\r\n### Activations\r\n\r\n* /namespace/?\r\n* /_c/nspath/?\r\n* /start/?\r\n\r\nKey points\r\n* Indexing mode set to lazy - For activations the rate of writes would be much higher compared to those on `whisks` and `subjects`. So here it would be better to keep indexing mode lazy\r\n\r\n### Index policy updates\r\n\r\nCurrent logic upon system start would query for existing indexes configured on the collection. If there is a mismatch between what is expected and what is currently found it would provision the new indexes. \r\n\r\nCosmosDB currently shows a strange behavior where it is [creating extra indexes][4] for same path. For e.g. `/namespace/?` is configured with hash index. But post creation if indexes are checked its found that it has both `Range` and `Hash` index configured. To account for these extra indexes in index check this PR uses a custom `IndexingPolicy` type which accounts for this type of behaviour while check if indexes are same.\r\n\r\nCosmosDB supports [online index policy changes][5] where by change in index definition would be performed asynchronously and online allowing the collection to remain available for writes while transformation is in progress. However if the application makes query relying on new indexes then those queries would fail untill indexing completes based on new index definition.\r\n\r\nSo in future if any change in index definition is done then it should be provisioned prior to deploying new code relying on that index. Current approach of checking for index definition would ensure that index definitions are consistent \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/indexing-policies\r\n[2]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/indexing-policies#index-precision\r\n[3]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cosmos-db/create-a-collection\r\n[4]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43775750/documentdb-creating-extra-indexes\r\n[5]: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/blog/update-your-documentdb-indexing-policies-online/","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/384567083/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/384567268","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/3325#issuecomment-384567268","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/3325","id":384567268,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NDU2NzI2OA==","user":{"login":"markusthoemmes","id":1289147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODkxNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1289147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes","html_url":"https://github.com/markusthoemmes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-26T09:01:34Z","updated_at":"2018-04-26T09:01:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"PG1 2819 reapproved","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/384567268/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/384568534","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/3583#issuecomment-384568534","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/3583","id":384568534,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NDU2ODUzNA==","user":{"login":"chetanmeh","id":664531,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NDUzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/664531?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chetanmeh","html_url":"https://github.com/chetanmeh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chetanmeh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chetanmeh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chetanmeh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chetanmeh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chetanmeh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chetanmeh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chetanmeh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chetanmeh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chetanmeh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-26T09:05:58Z","updated_at":"2018-04-26T09:05:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Was thinking to change such tests to use [ScalaFutures][1] with [IntegrationPatience][2] and avoid custom await logic.

That would mean we switch from Hotspot to J9. I'd say we should delay this to a different discussion because I think it's orthogonal?\r\n\r\nThe intend for this was to switch to a prebuilt Oracle JDK image. Moving to OpenJDK imho is change enough for one PR. We need to be careful here, it's our core components. OpenJDK should at least also have the Hotspot VM in it, we should be good there performancewise.\r\n\r\nIf we want to switch to OpenJ9, we'll need a performance-comparison of **our** components and see if we gain anything by that.\r\n\r\nSo my vote is: Stay Oracle/OpenJDK in this PR.
