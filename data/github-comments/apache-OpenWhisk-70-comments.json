At any given time a container is serving at most one request. But that same container may be reused to run the same action again in the future. It is also true that more than one container may be running servicing multiple requests for the same action. This is called a warm start, and exists in the current container pool implementation as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/286627369/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/286633855","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/1790#issuecomment-286633855","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/1790","id":286633855,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NjYzMzg1NQ==","user":{"login":"style95","id":3447251,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDcyNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3447251?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95","html_url":"https://github.com/style95","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-15T03:53:04Z","updated_at":"2017-03-16T08:35:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I added commits for proxy configuration.\r\n\r\nActually, it was working with all the tests in `testLean`.\r\nBut once I rebase the code to the latest master, it does not work.\r\n\r\nI could fix that also, but before that I pushed the commits.\r\nI am not quite sure the way I developed, so I want to have the same view with other people first.\r\n\r\nOnce we reach a consensus about how to address this issue, I will resolve all other test failures also.\r\nI expect lots of comments.\r\n\r\nWhat I intended is as follow:\r\n\r\n1.

That is, when you run a container as a traditional web service, you have to gauge cpu/memory requirements in line with traffic and usage characteristics.  Instead of analysis to infer concurrent activation support, I would expect making this more explicit, like based on a different function name (main() vs mainConcurrent()) or annotation or ? would be better, but maybe there are cases where inferred behavior would also be useful. \r\n\r\nI look at it as one additional knob for tuning resource utilization, where you can gain some benefits of serverless (scaling is done, but now based on reaching max allowed concurrency), and you also gain some benefits of increasing resource efficiency (in some cases functions may be just as happy serving 200 (or 2000+) concurrent activations as a single activation).  Tuning cpu shares for  concurrent requests support may be too coarse grained of an adjustment for many situations.\r\n\r\nAnother approach would be to avoid statically defining concurrency, and instead allow actions to define some backpressure function (in addition to \"main()\"), so that there can be some more custom logic applied to the concurrency limits.
