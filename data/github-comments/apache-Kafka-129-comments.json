@mjsax for reviews (this is still WIP):\r\n\r\n1. Follow the refactoring ideas in https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2166#pullrequestreview-15180711. Now the hierarchies can be viewed in `RocksDBKeyValueStoreSupplier`, `RocksDBWindowStoreSupplier`, `RocksDBSessionStoreSupplier`. Note that when caching or logging is enabled, all the underlying stores will be typed as `<Bytes, byte[]>` for performance optimizations. \r\n\r\n2. Added a few `AbstractXXX` classes to collapse common functions across some peer classes.\r\n\r\n3. Refactored `Stores` a bit to better aligned with the supplier class.\r\n\r\n4. Removed some redundant inner maps in `ProcessorTopology` which is only used `ProcessorStateManager` for flushing stores and remembering the changelog topic of the stores, instead let the `ProcessorTopology` to construct the full map from stores to their corresponding changelog topics if they are logging enabled within `build()`. It also allows to extract logging out of `RocksDB`.\r\n\r\nSome more thoughts\r\n\r\n5. With `WrapperStateStore`, we can now call `context.register(..)` in the outer-most store and call its `inner().put(...)` in the restoreCallback instead of calling it in the inner-most store, and hence can further get rid of the `root` parameter.\r\n\r\n6. We can let users-customized aggregation / join operators to be per-store configurable so that we can also remove the `TupleForwarder` interface. I.e.:\r\n\r\n```\r\nStateStoreSupplier<...> mySupplier = new MyStateStoreSupplier(...)\r\n\r\n// this means library will not add any wrappers for logging / caching / etc\r\n// if users have caching mechanism in its only supplier, she needs to consider \r\n// flushing / eviction / forwarding herself.\r\nstream.groupByKey(...).aggregate(..., supplier);   \r\n\r\n// this means library will wrap user-provided underlying store engine as required\r\n// users do not need to consider the above and our wrapper will do that without hacking forwarder.\r\nStateStoreSupplier<...> myWrappedSupplier = Stores.create(storeName)\r\n                .withKeys(keySerde)\r\n                .withValues(aggValueSerde)\r\n                .persistent()\r\n                .enableCaching();\r\n                .wrap(mySupplier);\r\n                .build();\r\n\r\nstream.groupByKey(...).aggregate(..., supplier);   \r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/271211443/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/271211923","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2107#issuecomment-271211923","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2107","id":271211923,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MTIxMTkyMw==","user":{"login":"yaojuncn","id":4308658,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDg2NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4308658?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaojuncn","html_url":"https://github.com/yaojuncn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaojuncn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaojuncn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaojuncn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaojuncn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaojuncn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaojuncn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaojuncn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaojuncn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaojuncn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-09T05:04:26Z","updated_at":"2017-01-09T05:04:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ewencp  how do you think of this PR? do you have any interest on this ticket?

- i've made a quick pass to try and understand where this is heading. I left a couple of comments, but i largely decided not to comment too much as this is a WIP and i wasn't sure what you are after.\r\n\r\nAnyway, i think the refactoring of the `StateStore` hierarchy generally looks good. The introduction of the `WrapperStateStore` interface and the abstract class makes the code a lot tidier. I'm not so sure about `AbstractSessionStore` and `AbstractWindowStore` as they don't offer much value, and i have a tendency to avoid unnecessarily deep inheritance (well, i'd actually prefer no impl inheritance at all!).\r\n\r\nIn `Stores` i think the addition of `PersistentSessionWindowedFactory` and `PersistentTimeWindowedFactory` are good. But i'm not really getting why we need `PersistentWrapperFactory` and the abstract classes that implement it? It seems to me that we just need a class that captures whether or not the stores are logged/cached etc. This could just be a shared class among all the factories that is created and passed to the constructor of the appropriate factory.\r\n
