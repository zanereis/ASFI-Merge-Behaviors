Here are something I found useful:\n1. Use homebrew to upgrade everything installed (sometimes needs to fix the links).\n2. Use LLVM-3.7 and add the corresponding flags. v3.8 and v3.5 failed in my laptop.\n3. Set `USE_CUDA_PATH = /usr/local/cuda` instead of `USE_CUDA_PATH = /Developer/NVIDIA/CUDA-7.5`. I don't know why the latter one leaded to errors.\n4. Set `USE_BLAS = apple`. I'm not sure if openblas would work - I haven't tried that.\n\nThese configurations solved multiple errors I encountered, e.g., `ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64`, `nvcc fatal   : redefinition of argument 'std'`, issues about `im2rec`, `llvm identifier \"_Allocator\" is undefined`,  and many others. \n\nAfter that, I set `USE_CUDA = 1, USE_CUDNN = 1, USE_NVRTC = 0, USE_OPENCV = 1, USE_OPENMP = 0`, and the installation succeeded. I could run the examples in both CPU and GPU mode.\n\nHope that this could help someone, since it's really annoying. I would appreciate if the documents and installation guide could be more clear.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/249374744/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/249377023","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/3274#issuecomment-249377023","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/3274","id":249377023,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0OTM3NzAyMw==","user":{"login":"piiswrong","id":568948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODk0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong","html_url":"https://github.com/piiswrong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-24T17:30:49Z","updated_at":"2016-09-24T17:30:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"current

CentOS 7 is a must, no CentOS 6.x, it is too old.\n2. `yum install opencv*` which install necessary devel packages.\n3. change the `Makefile` 's `setup opencv` part to:\n\n```\n# setup opencv\nifeq ($(USE_OPENCV), 1)\n    #CFLAGS += -DMXNET_USE_OPENCV=1 `pkg-config --cflags opencv`\n    #LDFLAGS += `pkg-config --libs opencv`\n    CFLAGS += -DMXNET_USE_OPENCV=1 -I/usr/include/opencv -I/usr/include/opencv2\n        LDFLAGS += -lopencv_calib3d -lopencv_imgproc -lopencv_contrib -lopencv_legacy -lopencv_core -lopencv_highgui\n        #LDFLAGS += -lopencv_calib3d -lopencv_imgproc -lopencv_contrib -lopencv_legacy -lopencv_core\n    BIN += bin/im2rec\nelse\n    CFLAGS+= -DMXNET_USE_OPENCV=0\nendif\n```\n\nit saves the worry from installing from the source. Maybe later on I will PR a `centos.mk` for centos only. `pkg-config` is so poor for centos.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/249999396/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/250005351","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/3337#issuecomment-250005351","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/3337","id":250005351,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MDAwNTM1MQ==","user":{"login":"mli","id":421857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTg1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/421857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli","html_url":"https://github.com/mli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-27T21:32:04Z","updated_at":"2016-09-27T21:32:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tqchen @piiswrong please have a quick check. if there is no objection, we are going to merge this PR.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/250005351/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/250023211","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/3337#issuecomment-250023211","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/3337","id":250023211,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MDAyMzIxMQ==","user":{"login":"piiswrong","id":568948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODk0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong","html_url":"https://github.com/piiswrong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-27T22:56:21Z","updated_at":"2016-09-27T22:56:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/250023211/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/250023366","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/3337#issuecomment-250023366","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/3337","id":250023366,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MDAyMzM2Ng==","user":{"login":"piiswrong","id":568948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODk0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong","html_url":"https://github.com/piiswrong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-27T22:57:13Z","updated_at":"2016-09-27T22:57:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Merging for now.
