I think I was too terse on my explanation previously. This change is purely to open up more possibilities for improvement and evolution of query server communication. Previously we were fairly tied to a stdio approach due to the level of abstraction in the couch_query_servers and couch_os_process modules. This work is just to try and abstract our basic function calls so that developers are able to experiment more without requiring the Erlang process communication.\r\n\r\nTo be slightly more concrete, the goal here is to be able to allow for a NIF based query server (i.e., having SpiderMonkey or V8 linked directly to the Erlang VM) while also allowing for network attached execution environments (i.e., gRPC [1]).\r\n\r\nOr to put that all in a whole new and different light, the original goal of having a new protocol was a bit limiting. Having a more abstract API that would let people execute COBOL on the moon is, I think, more in line with what was intended. Also, if someone has COBOL servers on the moon, I'd like to have a chat because that would be awesome.\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/cloudant-labs/ateles\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/537307648/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/537534962","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/2169#issuecomment-537534962","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/2169","id":537534962,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNzUzNDk2Mg==","user":{"login":"rnewson","id":47223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson","html_url":"https://github.com/rnewson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-02T15:01:09Z","updated_at":"2019-10-02T15:01:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Given that the behaviours themselves continues to be supported (albeit independently), I don't think we should remove these options; they are both reasonable combinations of the new `stable` and `update` options.\r\n\r\n+1 for a WONTFIX from me also.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/537534962/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/537535667","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/1514#issuecomment-537535667","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1514","id":537535667,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNzUzNTY2Nw==","user":{"login":"sploders101","id":26530958,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTMwOTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26530958?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sploders101","html_url":"https://github.com/sploders101","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sploders101/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sploders101/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sploders101/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sploders101/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sploders101/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sploders101/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sploders101/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sploders101/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sploders101/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-02T15:02:36Z","updated_at":"2019-10-02T15:02:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@kocolosk \r\nThat's good to know, thanks! \r\n\r\n@davisp \r\nThank you for the clarification!

Wohali's comment is what concerned me, talking about getting rid of the query server entirely, but it seems I misunderstood.\r\n\r\nUsing a well-defined protocol for query servers should be more than fine. If you are doing something network-based though, unix sockets may be worth looking into. I'm not sure how they are done in erlang, but the C/C++ api is almost identical to that of TCP. I believe the only difference is in construction, due to the fact that it uses a file path instead of a network address.\r\n\r\nI'm excited to see where this goes!\r\n\r\nThanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/537535667/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/537538145","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/2217#issuecomment-537538145","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/2217","id":537538145,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNzUzODE0NQ==","user":{"login":"willholley","id":97787,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3Nzg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/97787?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willholley","html_url":"https://github.com/willholley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willholley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willholley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willholley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willholley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willholley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willholley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willholley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willholley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willholley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-02T15:08:06Z","updated_at":"2019-10-02T15:08:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"prior to release it would be good to get https://github.com/apache/couchdb-fauxton/pull/1227 in.
