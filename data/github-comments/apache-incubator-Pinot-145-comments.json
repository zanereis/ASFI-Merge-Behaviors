It was due to a `cmp >= 0` assertion that should be `cmp <= 0`. The reason that made it very hard to find the problem is that `BaseCombineOperator` is not prepared to catch `Errors`, so the task at the server just failed without printing any log and as a result the broker didn't receive a response, so the error shown in the broker was that some server didn't answer.\r\n\r\nThings to know about:\r\n- Pinot may not log `AssertionErrors`, so it is better to do not use `assert` expressions\r\n- We may or may not want to log in case we receive an error. As I don't know what do we want to do in that case, I've just changed my code to throw an `ArgumentException`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1185614439/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1185643465","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/8991#issuecomment-1185643465","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/8991","id":1185643465,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5Gq3vJ","user":{"login":"walterddr","id":3581352,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1ODEzNTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3581352?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr","html_url":"https://github.com/walterddr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-15T15:14:48Z","updated_at":"2022-07-15T15:17:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> \r\n\r\nthe commit hash https://github.com/apache/pinot/commit/438c53b was on May 12. would you be able to share exactly how we can generate this report from a docker image or dist-JAR?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1185643465/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1185650703","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/9012#issuecomment-1185650703","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/9012","id":1185650703,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5Gq5gP","user":{"login":"walterddr","id":3581352,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1ODEzNTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3581352?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr","html_url":"https://github.com/walterddr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-15T15:23:08Z","updated_at":"2022-07-15T15:23:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> I've decided to remove the cpu requests and specify instead `-XX=ActiveProcessorCount=2` in the default jvmOpts.\r\n\r\nmaybe we can reduce this to 1? some older laptops don't have 8 cores.\r\n\r\n> I think this approach is better because the request approach consumed at least 8 CPUs.

Instead, the OS is the one that is going to time slice between them. In most cases this isn't going to be a problem because, for example, when a query is being executed either the threads from the server or the ones from the broker will be active, but not both at the same time. If we decide to use only 1 thread then we would need to change the GC (doesn't make sense to use G1 with 1 thread).\r\n\r\n> I am not familiar with now minikube/microk8s maps CPUs to host, just to clarify are these 8 cores virtual or the ones that are physical (include hyperthreading)?\r\n\r\nTBH I'm also not sure.

It was due to a `cmp >= 0` assertion that should be `cmp <= 0`. The reason that made it very hard to find the problem is that `BaseCombineOperator` is not prepared to catch `Errors`, so the task at the server just failed without printing any log and as a result the broker didn't receive a response, so the error shown in the broker was that some server didn't answer.\r\n> \r\n> Things to know about:\r\n> \r\n> * Pinot may not log `AssertionErrors`, so it is better to do not use `assert` expressions\r\n> * We may or may not want to log in case we receive an error. As I don't know what do we want to do in that case, I've just changed my code to throw an `ArgumentException`.\r\n\r\n+1. can we file an issue for fixing the AssertException not surfacing problem?

It was due to a `cmp >= 0` assertion that should be `cmp <= 0`. The reason that made it very hard to find the problem is that `BaseCombineOperator` is not prepared to catch `Errors`, so the task at the server just failed without printing any log and as a result the broker didn't receive a response, so the error shown in the broker was that some server didn't answer.\r\n> \r\n> Things to know about:\r\n> \r\n> * Pinot may not log `AssertionErrors`, so it is better to do not use `assert` expressions\r\n> * We may or may not want to log in case we receive an error. As I don't know what do we want to do in that case, I've just changed my code to throw an `ArgumentException`.\r\n\r\nWe use `assert` to ensure certain behavior, but also avoid the overhead of the extra check. In production environment, `assert` statement is ignored, which is the desired behavior. In performance critical path, we want to avoid the extra check if we know certain behavior is expected.\r\n`assert` can be enabled by setting a JVM parameter: `-ea`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1189551878/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1189612583","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/8325#issuecomment-1189612583","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/8325","id":1189612583,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5G6Awn","user":{"login":"jackjlli","id":35080149,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MDgwMTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35080149?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli","html_url":"https://github.com/jackjlli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-19T22:27:51Z","updated_at":"2022-07-20T21:55:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The end-to-end deployment with Helix 1.0.4 is done at LinkedIn.

I explained this on a call with @siddharthteotia several months ago.\r\n\r\n@richardstartin can you provide a gmail ID I can share the document with so that you can access the results? We didn't try the bit alignment to the next multiple of 8. Today morning I ran a few experiments to try that out. We haven't implemented a full-fledged index creator for the approach to compress the bit packed dictionary IDs in the forward index, but use an approximate approach where we extract the dictionary encoded forward index from the segment file and apply lz4 / zstd compression for the whole extracted file using command line compression tools (which is why it's approximate).\r\n\r\nWhen I tried it this morning, the size of the forward index increased after rounding up from 18 to 24 bits as expected. LZ4 compression couldn't bring the size down to the original bit encoded format using 18 bits. ZSTD performed better and did bring down the size a bit (compression ratio compared to the original dict encoded forward index using 18 bits: 1.15).\r\n\r\nI've updated these findings in the document as well.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1190310738/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1190369737","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/9072#issuecomment-1190369737","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/9072","id":1190369737,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5G85nJ","user":{"login":"walterddr","id":3581352,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1ODEzNTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3581352?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr","html_url":"https://github.com/walterddr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-20T14:37:24Z","updated_at":"2022-07-20T14:37:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Tests seem to be running for a lot longer than user.\r\n\r\nfound the issue was one of the legacy PQL query options.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1190369737/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1190381869","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/9072#issuecomment-1190381869","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/9072","id":1190381869,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5G88kt","user":{"login":"siddharthteotia","id":2150694,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTA2OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2150694?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia","html_url":"https://github.com/siddharthteotia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-20T14:47:36Z","updated_at":"2022-07-20T14:47:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> > Tests seem to be running for a lot longer than user.\r\n> \r\n> found the issue was one of the legacy PQL query options.\r\n\r\nCurious how was this leading to tears running longer ?

But it would be a very non-traditional way of using the HTTP response code.\r\n- [Container Management in K8s](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/) provides the liveness/readiness/startup probes specifically to differentiate different type of condition of the container pod, but I am not seeing any customization to allow parsing of the response content.\r\n \r\nSome Thoughts\r\n==\r\n- Initially, this issue is created to deal with running Pinot on K8s, while debugging a slow pod restart failure. thus I added the `health/instance` for liveness probe; and use the normal `health` for readiness probe.\r\n- I've also discovered that when the slow pod restart returns a 404 (BAD) state. It doesn't tell me exactly which segment was slow loading for which table. thus I added the additional endpoint `health/service` to return the entire service status callback map. \r\n\r\nSeems like it is causing some confusion and addressing both issues at the same time also distract the discussion. So I would say let's focus on the main purpose of the discussion to find a way to allow containerization software to know whether a pinot server is alive vs. a pinot server is ready for serving queries. \r\n\r\nif there's a way to easily configure k8s or ELB to differentiate the 2 server state.
