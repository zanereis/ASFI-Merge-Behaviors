An initial thought was to add an additional column, but, I think, we already have a lot of columns. I've tried to figure which columns to trim, but almost all seem relevant. I know we might come back to doing similar things with Resource Management as well, where we'll again need to work on estimates vs actual. So adding additional columns is not practical.\r\n\r\nShowing the estimates based on whether a planning decision was made using statistics is not possible unless the profile JSON itself carries some hint that statistics were used.\r\n\r\nAlso, I added the toggle button to provide a mechanism to hide the estimates by default (another reason why not an additional column). I'm worried that users will get the impression that there are issues with Drill because of estimates being wildly off. Even if they are sufficiently accurate (like NDV-based estimates vs actual), most users don't have the insight into how the stats are being used.\r\n\r\nUsers who have insight into such things can make use of the estimates to tune parameters (e.g. broadcast or selectivity thresholds) to force changes in plans that are sub-optimal. Based on this, I thought we should go with the parenthesis option for showing the estimated row counts.
