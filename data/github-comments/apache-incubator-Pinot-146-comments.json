ORDER BY `<first expression is MV identifier expression>` , 0 or more expressions could be SV or MV\r\n- SELECT ..... ORDER BY `<first expression is MV transform expression>`, 0 or more expressions could be SV or MV\r\n\r\nI agree that changing min-max operator is too late and the problem can be solved / detected sooner. \r\n\r\nI also agree that purist way of solving this is to detect the presence of **any** MV expression in the ORDER BY expressions like in `SelectionOrderByOperator` constructor and throw exception. I think it is a clean solution.\r\n\r\nHowever, currently the engine lets 2nd category of queries go through by ignoring the MV expression in the ORDER BY list. The 1st category fails later during execution with not a meaningful error in the min-max operator when trying to execute first expression.\r\n\r\nMaking changes to constructor of `SelectionOrderByOperator` will fail both categories (which is good ) but I have no idea if our production has any queries from 2nd category  so there is a potential of breaking prod queries (if any) not just for us but even for OSS customers / users. There is no way for me to find percentage of such queries from our prod logs\r\n\r\nTo continue running 2nd category queries (like today), we decided not to make the operator change and instead fail during server planning by special casing for category 1 queries.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts on the risk to do the clean/pure solution ? If there is such query in production, we may have to rollback or force the client app to change queries. cc @somandal @Jackie-Jiang  @walterddr ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1192039642/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1192041197","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/9088#issuecomment-1192041197","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/9088","id":1192041197,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5HDRrt","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-21T23:59:54Z","updated_at":"2022-07-22T00:54:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/9088?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) Report\n> Merging [#9088](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/9088?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (989df64) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/commit/989df641b7d29e18773a668663b0be894835d24f?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (989df64) will **not change** coverage.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n> :exclamation: Current head 989df64 differs from pull request most recent head 808c3be.

I haven't spent much time thinking about the implications of this feature, and these observations are great. \r\n\r\n1. You're right that this could lead to much higher storage cost, perhaps it would be possible to have some type of limit option for creating the permutations? I'm not sure this makes sense, as the behaviour could be unpredictable. There would be no way of knowing which types of multi-valued column values have been indexed, so it would have to be discussed whether this is an acceptable trade-off or not.\r\n2. What exactly do you mean? Are you saying storing all permutations, or simply one index split per value? If it is the latter as I had written up in my issue, then that makes sense. However, if it's all possible permutations being indexed, then this would probably not be feasible. We would then suffer exponential storage explosion due to all the possible permutations. This is why I am arguing that an acceptable trade-off would be to allow a lookup on simple one value\r\n3. I hadn't considered the implications on the star-node. This seems like one of the most challenging problems to solve, and it makes it seem like perhaps the star node is not compatible at that level. We will need to think about this one more..","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1192331732/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1192397465","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/9077#issuecomment-1192397465","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/9077","id":1192397465,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5HEoqZ","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-22T09:55:25Z","updated_at":"2022-07-22T09:55:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/9077?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) Report\n> Merging [#9077](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/9077?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (52c1c3d) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/commit/f0a4b443699bd550b1608e4dea7cd68bc9bc6a61?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (f0a4b44) will **decrease** coverage by `41.63%`.\n> The diff coverage is `13.36%`.\n\n> :exclamation: Current head 52c1c3d differs from pull request most recent head 43d12ca.

The reasons why I've decided to return a counter instead are:\r\n - a boolean tells the end criteria has reached but doesn't tell anything about progress made, so if the end criteria is changed in future work we may hit other edge cases\r\n - returning a boolean in conjunction with the check in `consumeLoop()` will be very specific to this bug where we cross the time threshold before consuming a single record\r\n - the conditionals in `consumeLoop()` could be simplified if `MessageBatch` allowed random access to a specific offset, the contract of this interface could be simplified as well\r\n\r\nI was expecting to make a few more changes before opening the PR. However, having said this, I am actually more interested in fixing this bug rather than trying making the code more generic or encapsulated so I'm happy to change the code and implement it with a boolean as you advise if expedites the fix.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1195191865/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1195249990","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/9106#issuecomment-1195249990","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/9106","id":1195249990,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5HPhFG","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-26T09:35:39Z","updated_at":"2022-07-26T09:44:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/9106?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) Report\n> Merging [#9106](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/9106?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (d21651e) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/commit/bbec0a8070ce1d689a382195b291d68ca945c040?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (bbec0a8) will **increase** coverage by `42.46%`.\n> The diff coverage is `90.00%`.\n\n```diff\n@@              Coverage Diff              @@\n##             master    #9106       +/-   ##\n=============================================\n+ Coverage     26.40%   68.86%   +42.46%     \n- Complexity       42     4664     +4622     \n=============================================\n  Files          1826     1838       +12     \n  Lines         96934    97311      +377     \n  Branches      14621    14665       +44     \n=============================================\n+ Hits          25599    67018    +41419     \n+ Misses        68835    25588    -43247     \n- Partials       2500     4705     +2205     \n```\n\n| Flag | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| integration1 | `26.47% <0.00%> (+0.06%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| unittests1 | `66.90% <ø> (?)` | |\n| unittests2 | `15.29% <90.00%> (?)` | |\n\nFlags with carried forward coverage won't be shown.

I might have just very rough, possibly inaccurate numbers.\r\n\r\n2) I feel the need of a control plane level API within pinot to give an overall view into current and past state of minion tasks is of importance to us. Task generator being a key part of the entire minion task flow. While metrics can help to some extent, having details like failure stack traces etc might be difficult. This api avoids having to tally metrics and debug logs from a separate log processing system. \r\n\r\n3) I suppose it could. But integrating the log processing framework into pinot APIs themselves might be a bit of a challenge. Having a system table for these kind of usecases might be the right way forward, such that pinot itself can store and serve debug data and status metrics for each of the components / flows.

I might have just very rough, possibly inaccurate numbers.\r\n> 2. I feel the need of a control plane level API within pinot to give an overall view into current and past state of minion tasks is of importance to us. Task generator being a key part of the entire minion task flow. While metrics can help to some extent, having details like failure stack traces etc might be difficult. This api avoids having to tally metrics and debug logs from a separate log processing system.\r\n\r\nI agree there is a need to debug minions. However this API does not provide any new insights other than what Helix already provides. So, let us work off of some concrete examples -- what is the use case in which you think this will help?\r\n\r\n> 3. I suppose it could. But integrating the log processing framework into pinot APIs themselves might be a bit of a challenge. Having a system table for these kind of usecases might be the right way forward, such that pinot itself can store and serve debug data and status metrics for each of the components / flows. Essentially move from in-memory storage of logs and metrics into the system table\r\n\r\nEvery installation has its own way of processing logs. Cloud installations typically pipe the logs into a log processing service to get insights into it.

My question to @saurabhd336  is : Have you looked at what Helix has to offer? If so, what are the short-comings?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1196980176/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1197097517","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/9110#issuecomment-1197097517","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/9110","id":1197097517,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5HWkIt","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-27T17:46:35Z","updated_at":"2022-07-27T17:50:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/9110?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) Report\n> Merging [#9110](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/9110?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (6904a43) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/commit/9cf7d81dd01ce4ea651cd6c2d5c0d91b7d1ea403?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (9cf7d81) will **decrease** coverage by `28.17%`.\n> The diff coverage is `100.00%`.\n\n```diff\n@@              Coverage Diff              @@\n##             master    #9110       +/-   ##\n=============================================\n- Coverage     63.53%   35.36%   -28.18%     \n+ Complexity     4727      184     -4543     \n=============================================\n  Files          1790     1838       +48     \n  Lines         95229    97398     +2169     \n  Branches      14429    14675      +246     \n=============================================\n- Hits          60506    34441    -26065     \n- Misses        30381    60110    +29729     \n+ Partials       4342     2847     -1495     \n```\n\n| Flag | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| integration1 | `26.42% <100.00%> (?)` | |\n| unittests1 | `?` | |\n| unittests2 | `15.32% <100.00%> (+0.02%)` | :arrow_up: |\n\nFlags with carried forward coverage won't be shown.

I might have just very rough, possibly inaccurate numbers.\r\n> 2. I feel the need of a control plane level API within pinot to give an overall view into current and past state of minion tasks is of importance to us. Task generator being a key part of the entire minion task flow. While metrics can help to some extent, having details like failure stack traces etc might be difficult. This api avoids having to tally metrics and debug logs from a separate log processing system.\r\n> 3. I suppose it could. But integrating the log processing framework into pinot APIs themselves might be a bit of a challenge. Having a system table for these kind of usecases might be the right way forward, such that pinot itself can store and serve debug data and status metrics for each of the components / flows. Essentially move from in-memory storage of logs and metrics into the system table\r\n> \r\n> @npawar @Jackie-Jiang to add more\r\n\r\nfor 1: typically for users of RealtimeToOfflineTask, tasks get generated hourly. For SegmentGenerationAndPushTask, it can be way more frequently, depending on the the number of times files are generated in the source dir.

I feel the need of a control plane level API within pinot to give an overall view into current and past state of minion tasks is of importance to us.

But integrating the log processing framework into pinot APIs themselves might be a bit of a challenge.

If the PMCs don't have any objection to this then I can live with this, but I am willing to bet that more such PRs will come up because logs are difficult to read.

Then there is another category where MV expression in ORDER BY is ignored. \r\n\r\nSee this comment thread - https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/9078#issuecomment-1192039642\r\n\r\nWe agreed on the original PR that users should write more sensible queries and throwing proper generic exception for any presence of MV expression in ORDER BY indicating it is not supported is best. \r\n\r\nHowever, we wanted to first find out if anyone is running 2nd category of query through this metric, work with them to change (if any) and then come back to throw the exception properly.\r\n\r\n> IMO, a better solution would be to simply remove the multi-value columns in order by fragment since it was getting ignored anyway.\r\n\r\nI don't think that's a good solution. Users should simply not write such queries. It's engine's responsibility to throw meaningful exceptions when users are writing bad / unsupported queries as opposed to silently ignoring things (one of the cases today) or throwing very implementation specific exception (another case) \r\n\r\n> We can probably throw exception few versions later\r\n\r\nThe problem will still remain on how to do this smoothly as opposed to a \"potentially\" breaking change where we suddenly start throwing exception for the 2nd case I mentioned above. \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1198343680/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1198450546","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/8483#issuecomment-1198450546","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/8483","id":1198450546,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5Hbudy","user":{"login":"Jackie-Jiang","id":17555551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTU1NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17555551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang","html_url":"https://github.com/Jackie-Jiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-28T17:45:31Z","updated_at":"2022-07-28T17:45:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jackjlli Can you please help add some pinot documentation for this new feature?
