I think this will have the effect of making users feel like the page is loading _much_ faster.\r\n\r\n> I'm thinking for visualizations that use React, they shouldn't have to import it and should somehow pick it up from global, same goes for jquery and perhaps a set of other things.\r\n\r\nReact [is not that large](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=react@16.3.2) (even smaller if we could actually upgrade to `16.0.0`) and I can't tell if you mean literal globals (`window.jquery`) but we should move away from that pattern (and `jquery` in general, it's just syntactic sugar for JS and ideally we'd be using fetch not ajax) rather than embrace it. \r\n\r\nIt seems like the proper way to pull out \"globally shared\" code is using the webpack `CommonChunksPlugin`, if chunks share code it will pull them into a new chunk. I used this to create a separate `chunk` for all shared deck.gl code, and I also added it in a way that it _should_ pull out all shared code into a separate chunk if it is imported by >=2 modules ... BUT this didn't appear to have any effect so the vis chunks must not really share that much code 🤷‍♀️ This is the new final webpack output (note the deckgl layer size decreases, and the new larger

tried to access \"time_grain_sqla\" (or any other key) in _form_data_ dict in Explore but I am afraid that it is empty.\r\n\r\nI think it was added at some point:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/commit/a0ddbb9ec954a65a77350bc054b83e35bc4dffeb#diff-f25a00842d88e3e5cc4e4bcc822d40f7\r\n\r\n but removed since i don't know why:\r\n\r\n ```\r\n   def get_sqla_query(  # sqla\r\n            self,\r\n            groupby, metrics,\r\n            granularity,\r\n            from_dttm, to_dttm,\r\n            filter=None,  # noqa\r\n

If I understood your needs correctly, you wanted to access `time_grain_sqla`? Since it is a static field, it (and other similar fields) shouldn't cause cache misses if included in the `query_obj`.\r\n\r\n@mistercrunch: Do you see any reason not to include static keys from `form_data` in `query_obj`? Either as stand alone keys/values similar to `groupby` and `filter`, or as some type of static representation of `form_data`, e.g. `static_form_data`?

There may be some opportunity to further optimize those, but would be interested in the webpack 4 upgrade stats before diving in on anything there.  Happy to help on this effort once you decide on direction to take this with @mistercrunch.\r\n\r\nThis is the output I got from your branch with the above plugin:\r\n\r\n![superset_bundle_impact](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17075065/39667677-2621846e-5081-11e8-888b-78ee04001225.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/386836907/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/386950641","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/4895#issuecomment-386950641","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/4895","id":386950641,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4Njk1MDY0MQ==","user":{"login":"liuzn4ever","id":30370101,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMzcwMTAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30370101?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzn4ever","html_url":"https://github.com/liuzn4ever","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzn4ever/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzn4ever/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzn4ever/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzn4ever/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzn4ever/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzn4ever/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzn4ever/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzn4ever/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzn4ever/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-07T03:53:15Z","updated_at":"2018-05-07T03:53:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I can't see the map in the slice.the error msg is \"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/mapbox/light-v9?access_token=no_token   404\" I don't know how to change the access_token ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/386950641/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/386999269","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/4929#issuecomment-386999269","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/4929","id":386999269,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4Njk5OTI2OQ==","user":{"login":"florianmonfort","id":1446429,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDY0Mjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1446429?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianmonfort","html_url":"https://github.com/florianmonfort","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianmonfort/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianmonfort/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianmonfort/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianmonfort/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianmonfort/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianmonfort/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianmonfort/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianmonfort/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianmonfort/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-07T08:42:02Z","updated_at":"2018-05-07T08:42:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Ok that's what I thought..
