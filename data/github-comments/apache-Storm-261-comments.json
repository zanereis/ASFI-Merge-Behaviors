Still +1.\r\n\r\n(One procedural nit: Rebasing/squashing on big PRs like this can make reviews a little harder. E.g. After you added the javadocs I wanted to review just that change, but the squash forced me to wade through all the other changes to find the ones I was looking for. Not a big deal, but something to keep in mind.)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/264288975/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/264290077","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1795#issuecomment-264290077","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1795","id":264290077,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NDI5MDA3Nw==","user":{"login":"revans2","id":3441321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDEzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3441321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2","html_url":"https://github.com/revans2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-01T20:47:41Z","updated_at":"2016-12-01T20:47:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"#1744 is in and this is rebased","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/264290077/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/264292929","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1800#issuecomment-264292929","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1800","id":264292929,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NDI5MjkyOQ==","user":{"login":"revans2","id":3441321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDEzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3441321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2","html_url":"https://github.com/revans2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-01T20:58:41Z","updated_at":"2016-12-01T20:58:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Rebased again","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/264292929/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/264299120","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1767#issuecomment-264299120","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1767","id":264299120,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NDI5OTEyMA==","user":{"login":"chawco","id":166363,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjM2Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/166363?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chawco","html_url":"https://github.com/chawco","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chawco/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chawco/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chawco/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chawco/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chawco/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chawco/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chawco/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chawco/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chawco/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-01T21:22:32Z","updated_at":"2016-12-01T21:22:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"So, there's some ambiguity in place here that would need to get resolved. Basically, there's two sources for InterruptedException/InterruptedIOException -- one from Storm itself, and one from the user's code (See: [STORM-2194](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-2194) If we want to have different behaviour from these two sources we do need some solution to disambiguate the uses.\r\n\r\nBasically, the problem is this: If anything in the user's thread raises these exceptions, the executor thread will terminate *but the worker will not*. This leaves the entire topology in a zombified state. I find it difficult to see that this behaviour is \"as intended\". \r\n\r\n@revans2 can you suggest a way we can disambiguate between Storm initiated and user initiated exceptions here? I'm having a real tough time thinking how we could accomplish that. Alternatively, can you propose an alternate implementation for signalling this shutdown? I'm happy to take on that work to make things shutdown in a more appropriate manner, as long as we get to fix this zombie topology behaviour.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/264299120/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/264299390","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1768#issuecomment-264299390","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1768","id":264299390,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NDI5OTM5MA==","user":{"login":"chawco","id":166363,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjM2Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/166363?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chawco","html_url":"https://github.com/chawco","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chawco/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chawco/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chawco/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chawco/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chawco/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chawco/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chawco/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chawco/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chawco/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-01T21:23:29Z","updated_at":"2016-12-01T21:23:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've left some follow up comments in [1767](https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1767).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/264299390/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
