You can directly build the artifacts from the heron directory\n\n```\ndocker/build-artifacts.sh ubuntu15.10 0.1.0-SNAPSHOT ~/output\n```\n\nSometimes, it is possible that docker container might hang especially during bazel compilation. In those cases, do the following\n\n```\n docker run -it heron-compiler:ubuntu15.10\n```\n\nOnce you are in the container, do the following:\n\n```\ncd /root\ngit clone <heron-repo>\nbazel build --config=ubuntu heron/...\nbazel test --config=ubuntu heron/...\nbazel build --config=ubuntu release:packages\n```\n\nIt will build the tarballs at bazel-bin/release.

Those config files define the classes needed for that cluster. You can parse these config files to get an instance of IScheduler. \n\nThis config is available from the client when you launch and the entire config is carried with the topology package and made available in the containers as well. In the container, they will be stored in\n\n```\n./heron-conf/\n```\n\nand several parse routines are available to read those files\nhttps://github.com/twitter/heron/tree/master/heron/spi/src/java/com/twitter/heron/spi/common\n\nSchedulerMain also reads from those files and you can make an instance of the IScheduler class.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/193652979/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/193653603","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/issues/131#issuecomment-193653603","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/131","id":193653603,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MzY1MzYwMw==","user":{"login":"kramasamy","id":367684,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzY4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/367684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy","html_url":"https://github.com/kramasamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-08T07:56:01Z","updated_at":"2016-03-08T07:56:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"With local installation, you can run some topologies right away using the examples using the following command \n\n```\nheron-cli3 submit local ~/.heron/examples/heron-examples.jar com.twitter.heron.examples.ExclamationTopology ExclamationTopology\n```\n\nYou won't be able to see the output unless you can get to the logs.
