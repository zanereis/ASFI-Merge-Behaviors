But there is no point debating on this. We can adapt to whatever people prefer. This'll likely go through a major change before 1.0 to support truly detached mode anyways.\n\n> > > Looks like your recent changes broke the YARN tests?\n\nYes. It's also kind of hard to debug them. I can't seem to run them on my VM, and travis build takes a full one and a half hour to produce anything useful, and even then, I can't access the complete logs. It probably requires AWS keys or something. I'm not sure.\nDo you know of any change I can make to travis conf so all modules are built but only Yarn tests get executed? \n\nI have one more concern:\nThere are four types of Yarn runs we can perform:\n1. Yarn session in detached mode: Equivalent to `bin/start-cluster.sh`\n2. Yarn session: Doesn't have a counterpart in standalone mode\n3. Per job yarn in detached mode: No counterpart in standalone mode, even after we add this PR.\n4. Per job yarn: No counterpart in standalone mode.\n\nNow, when `bin/flink -d` is run, user will expect there to be a single semantics; that a cluster will be brought up, job will be submitted and the cluster will be terminated. However, there doesn't seem to be any way of achieving this in standalone mode. Will this create any confusion? \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/155385085/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/155391848","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1214#issuecomment-155391848","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1214","id":155391848,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NTM5MTg0OA==","user":{"login":"mxm","id":837221,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNzIyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/837221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm","html_url":"https://github.com/mxm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-10T11:13:01Z","updated_at":"2015-11-10T11:13:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Do you know of any change I can make to travis conf so all modules are built but only Yarn tests get executed? \n\nYes change the build instructions in .travis.yml to run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` followed by a `cd flink-yarn-tests && mvn verify`. Locally, you can find the logs in the target directory of flink-yarn-tests. There is also a way to upload these log files with an AWS account.\n\nI think the different semantics for YARN and standalone are fine. The `-d` flag always starts the job detached. That's independent of YARN or standalone mode.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/155391848/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/155393090","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1306#issuecomment-155393090","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1306","id":155393090,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NTM5MzA5MA==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-10T11:19:04Z","updated_at":"2015-11-10T11:19:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi

created a test topology that puts the current time in an HBase cell several times per second.\nIn the cluster I did this on HBase is configured to use Kerberos and the Kerberos tickets expire after 10 hours.\nI let this running for 22:15 (so more than twice the expire time) and it continues to successfully update the column in HBase.\n\nSo from my standpoint this patch is ready to be committed.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/155708227/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/155713026","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1338#issuecomment-155713026","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1338","id":155713026,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NTcxMzAyNg==","user":{"login":"rmetzger","id":89049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger","html_url":"https://github.com/rmetzger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-11T09:24:58Z","updated_at":"2015-11-11T09:24:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank
