However, I liked the first version better, as there was no way to misuse it from a user perspective. In  this version, some can call the `public` method `EvaluatorRequestBuilder.submit()` and trigger a nullpointer exception if no `EvaluatorRequestor` was set. The one downside of the initial version was that too much of it was `public`.\n\nWe frequently encounter this problem, as Java doesn't really have a keyword to indicate \"accessible only within REEF\" like C# has with the `internal` keyword. We \"fix\" this by using the `@Private` annotation which suggests to apps not to rely on the existence of the API marked with it.\n\nMaybe go back to the first version and mark the `public` parts of the API that shouldn't be public with `@Private`?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/217933822/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/217940695","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/991#issuecomment-217940695","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/991","id":217940695,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNzk0MDY5NQ==","user":{"login":"jwang98052","id":5666504,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NjY1MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5666504?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052","html_url":"https://github.com/jwang98052","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-09T18:02:11Z","updated_at":"2016-05-09T18:02:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I completed a pass. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/217940695/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/217945335","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/988#issuecomment-217945335","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/988","id":217945335,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNzk0NTMzNQ==","user":{"login":"markusweimer","id":502371,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjM3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/502371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer","html_url":"https://github.com/markusweimer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-09T18:18:56Z","updated_at":"2016-05-09T18:18:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM, within the current protocols.
