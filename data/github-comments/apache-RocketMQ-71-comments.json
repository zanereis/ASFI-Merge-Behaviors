If there is someone who want to support messages with a large time span, he must extend the save time of commitLog because the delayed messages are saved together with the normal messages. But this means that we will save normal messages for a long time. It seems to be useless to do this.\r\n\r\naws_sqs support max 15minutes delay messages\r\nI think large time span in real world is not a major demandÔºàmaybe 0.1% of  businessÔºâ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/835162760/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/835185037","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/2290#issuecomment-835185037","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/2290","id":835185037,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgzNTE4NTAzNw==","user":{"login":"cserwen","id":46882838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2ODgyODM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46882838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cserwen","html_url":"https://github.com/cserwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cserwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cserwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cserwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cserwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cserwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cserwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cserwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cserwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cserwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-08T07:50:55Z","updated_at":"2021-05-08T07:50:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@vongosling \r\nBased on this implementation, we have a better optimization plan.
