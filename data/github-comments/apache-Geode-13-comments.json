@jinmeiliao, thanks for having a look at this.\r\nI might be missing something, but within `CreateIndexCommand` you can just persist one `XmlEntity` to the cluster configuration service because you only have one index created on a single region.\r\nIn this particular case, `CreateDefinedIndexesCommand` can create more than one index and not necessarily for the same region, that's why all of the  `XmlEntity` should be persisted to the cluster configuration service.\r\nAs an example:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngfsh -e \"connect --locator=localhost[10101]\" \\\r\n\t-e \"create region --name=TestRegion1 --type=REPLICATE\" \\\r\n\t-e \"create region --name=TestRegion2 --type=REPLICATE\"\r\ngfsh -e \"connect --locator=localhost[10101]\" \\\r\n\t-e \"define index --name=index1 --expression=value1

The main problem is that we want a member to survive in the view for longer time than others.\r\n\r\nIf we deprecate the settings into one setting and pass the setting to monitoring member(say A), then it will use the target member(say B which we want to survive in view for longer time) timeout for health monitoring and ack-wait-threshold to wait for the response for any message before doing final check.\r\nBut what if some other member(say C) which is monitoring any other member(say D) have the member-timeout and ack-wait-threshold some smaller values. So if member C messages to B, C uses the smaller value of ack-wait-threshold(which is of member D) to get a response and does the final check again on basis of smaller member-timeout. So still member B can be kicked out of the view in small amount of time.\r\n\r\nI think this can be solved simply if we use the member-timeout of suspected member in the final check where we establish TCP connection. We don't need to club those three settings as well. We can set the member-timeout of a particular member to a higher value and the member which monitors it uses its own member-timeout as it is now, but during the final check it uses the suspected member-timeout(which is a greater value). The final check is common place in both the no heartbeat scenario and no response for a message scenario.\r\n\r\nAre there any concerns around this new proposal ?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/342050930/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/342205242","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/1011#issuecomment-342205242","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/1011","id":342205242,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MjIwNTI0Mg==","user":{"login":"jdeppe-pivotal","id":5313410,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMTM0MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5313410?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/jdeppe-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-06T16:33:20Z","updated_at":"2017-11-06T16:33:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm
