Over time we can expose more standard functions there.  For e.g more advanced compaction and clustering strategies call be specified there. We may need a `SHOW services t1` to show information for these scheduled calls.  \r\n\r\n\r\nChecked off items I think are already covered in this PR.

The cause is checkpoint is only made of time info and S3 granularity is unusually coarse (in seconds)  \r\n\r\n- A long term fix would be a different checkpointing mechanism like time+filename but that would take some time to implement. \r\n- A short term fix is WIP in #2845 which solves the case where skipping caused by source limit cut on files with same mod time, but won't solve this racing condition. \r\n- In your particular scenario, since you don't set source limit, the problem could be resolved by change [this line](https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/03668dbaf1a60428d7e0d68c6622605e0809150a/hudi-utilities/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/utilities/sources/helpers/DFSPathSelector.java#L165) to `status.getModificationTime() >= lastCheckpointTime`. It will read some files twice but I think it's ok assuming you're upserting. We don't make this fix in #2845 is due to this could lead to infinite loop of read files with source limit being relatively small. Also reading same files more than once relies on upsert mode or use case being ok with at-least once processing.\r\n\r\nI suggest you extend the existing path selector to a custom class and change that line of code. Then try plug in the custom class in your pipeline and see if files get processed. Meanwhile, would need more input from @nsivabalan @vinothchandar on short/long term plan.

We are using hudi version 0.6.0\r\nThis will result in a 30 seconds lag while writing records which is acceptable to us and will address missing file problem completely.The 30 seconds lag will be configurable via an environment variable.The HoodieDeltaStreamer takes  --source-class as a argument where we will be providing our custom JsonDFSSource which delegates to our custom DFSPathSelector.\r\n- Can you please validate whether hoodiedeltastreamer will be able to record correct checkpoint with the change I am proposing to make above ?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/824917902/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/824998521","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/2532#issuecomment-824998521","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/2532","id":824998521,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyNDk5ODUyMQ==","user":{"login":"jsbali","id":1778470,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3Nzg0NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1778470?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsbali","html_url":"https://github.com/jsbali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsbali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsbali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsbali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsbali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsbali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsbali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsbali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsbali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsbali/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-22T16:35:04Z","updated_at":"2021-04-22T16:35:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hey @lhjzmn  If you are not working on it.

FYI We landed a [fix](https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/2765) wrt default vals and null in unions. If incase, the schema post processing is not required at all w/ this fix, it would simplify things.
