Can you expand on your reasoning for the refactoring there? For example, I'm wondering why testKeyStoreRoundTrip is no longer being used, etc.\r\n\r\nThanks for the feedback @gresockj.  The core concept of the round trip methods remains, but I removed the unnecessary KeyStoreSupplier interface and streamlined the methods.  The `assertKeyEntryStoredLoaded` and `assertCertificateEntryStoredLoaded` methods follow the same approach as before by populating a source KeyStore with an entry, writing it to an OutputStream, and then reading it into a destination KeyStore instance.  I wrapped all of in a loop that tests all values in the `KeystoreType` enum.  Previously there were individual test methods for each KeystoreType, so this approach ensures that any changes to `KeystoreType` will automatically be tested.

Yeah, I did consider a timeout on some of those wait's. But if it does timeout, i dont know that it's really going to be able to recover. So it could either wait a while and then give up and throw an Exception or something, which would leave the node in \"some\" state. Or it could just wait forever. The advantage of waiting forever is that it's really just polling an external state and waiting for the desired state. So while waiting forever, if something results in the background tasks completing (such as a problematic network being addressed, or someone manually addressing an issue) it would continue on. I kind of feel like it makes sense to leave this part as-is for now and see if we run into situations later where we want to adjust it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/825826144/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/826108687","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5026#issuecomment-826108687","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5026","id":826108687,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyNjEwODY4Nw==","user":{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-24T15:23:27Z","updated_at":"2021-04-24T15:23:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hey @tolaini the change looks good to me, but the base branch needs to be `main`, not `support/nifi-1.13`.
