The basic summary of changes that this requires is moving ContainerPool to a shared (common/scala) location, and allowing a case for a loadbalancer that is ContainerFactory-aware. \r\n\r\nSo, yes, I'm all for doing this. This PR, I think, \"only\" creates the SPI, and does not create new impls, unless I'm missing something, which is fine, but I think some of the signatures need to change to isolate some of the SPI interface and more cleanly define what is the interface that loadbalancer defines. \r\n\r\nWill review in more details, but would like feedback on the

I have two concerns, one of which is directly related to adding s390x, and one of which is something I've been scratching my head about anyway.\r\n\r\n1. I did away with 'cli_arch' and only reluctantly kept 'cli_os' as ansible variables.  Instead, I introduced 'cli_os_arch' to list VALID combinations of os and architecture.  In particular, when I added 's390x' arch, 'mac' and 'windows' did not make sense as OSs.  Therefore I enumerated valid pairs.  In the new code in #3100, there's still a nested loop of cli_os and cli_arch to create the directory structure.  I can fix it if 3100 goes first, but perhaps we should unify on a strategy, which brings me to...\r\n\r\n1. The treatment of `bin/wsk`.  I'm at a loss here -- what's the appropriate action for this binary in each of the three modes?  Here, the binary is being used locally to execute OpenWhisk actions, so we need to have it on the filesystem, but we either download it or copy it from the local build in the next project over.  I suppose the appropriate actions are [ local: copy, remote: download, remote_redirect: download ], but I'm not sure either of us has it that way right now.  I can tweak it if I go second, but it may be worth a second look at #3100.  I'm not sure I have rights to comment at the point over there, but I'll try to.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/353756150/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/353816786","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/3134#issuecomment-353816786","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/3134","id":353816786,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MzgxNjc4Ng==","user":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-25T02:26:55Z","updated_at":"2017-12-25T02:26:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The

My intention was to have build occur in the 'incubator-openwhisk-cli' project.  The build would actually create two artifacts:\r\n\r\n1. The `wsk` binaries (as it does today).\r\n\r\n1. A tarball for deployment in Nginx consisting of the binaries directory structure _and_ the `content.json` file.\r\n\r\nRiffing on that, the CLI \"download\" could pull the tarball from a URL, and for local build the configuration could override that URL with `file://../../incubator-openwhisk-cli/build/<path-to-tarball>.tgz`.  So we only need to address the two Nginx configurations (download vs redirect) -- anyone wanting local build should be savvy enough to do the build themselves before overriding the URL.  Local CLI sourcing is similar -- is a URL override provided?  Get that.
