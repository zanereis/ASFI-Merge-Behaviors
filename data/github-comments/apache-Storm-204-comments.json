But the problem is aggravated by the fact, that the `connectionAttempts` counter is never reset. So if a topology runs for a long enough time this might become a problem.<br/>\n    Actually this issue has been fixed in 0.10.0</p>\n\n<p>    There is another more serious issue that lead to huge problem in one of out topologies whenever a worker crashed due to some exception.<br/>\n    If worker A sucessfully connects to worker B for the first time during startup but worker B closes the connection for some reason before the `:worker-active-flag` is set to true (here <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/v0.9.6/storm-core/src/clj/backtype/storm/daemon/worker.clj#L356\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/v0.9.6/storm-core/src/clj/backtype/storm/daemon/worker.clj#L356</a>), there will be no further reconnect attempts, since no messages will be processed and neither `send()` nor `flushMessages()` will ever be called.</p>\n\n<p>    In our case this frequenty happened because nimbus often rescheduled the whole toplogy right around the same time when the supervisor restarted the failed worker, leading to a race condition. This might have to do with the fact that `nimbus.task.timeout.secs` and `supervisor.worker.timeout.secs` have the same value by default.</p>\n\n<p>    Tedxia's patch won't fix this problem I belive, since the status returned by `status()` will be `ConnectionWithStatus$Status/Connecting` in this situation.</p>\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612580125/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612890800","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/5502#issuecomment-2612890800","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/5502","id":2612890800,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI4OTA4MDA=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-31T15:49:29Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T16:10:39Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=githubbot\">githubbot</a>:</i>\n<p>Github user satishd commented on a diff in the pull request:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1280#discussion_r58077961\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1280#discussion_r58077961</a></p>\n\n<p>    &#8212; Diff: storm-core/src/clj/org/apache/storm/daemon/supervisor.clj &#8212;<br/>\n    @@ -296,11 +293,15 @@<br/>\n     (worker-launcher-and-wait conf user <span class=\"error\">&#91;\"signal\" pid \"9\"&#93;</span> :log-prefix (str \"kill -9 \" pid))<br/>\n     (force-kill-process pid))<br/>\n   (if as-user</p>\n<ul class=\"alternate\" type=\"square\">\n\t<li>(rmr-as-user conf id (worker-pid-path conf id pid))<br/>\n     (try<br/>\n    +  (rmr-as-user conf id (worker-pid-path conf id pid))<br/>\n       (rmpath (worker-pid-path conf id pid))<br/>\n       (rmpath (worker-tmp-root conf id pid))</li>\n\t<li>(catch Exception e)))) ;; on windows, the supervisor may still holds the lock on the worker directory<br/>\n    +  (catch IOException e<br/>\n    +    (log-warn-error e \"Failed to cleanup pid dir: \" pid \" for worker \" id\".

since there is any non-deterministic exception might be thrown in Windows environment, we may still ignore all types of exception, which might also be why the previous code did this way (\"catch
