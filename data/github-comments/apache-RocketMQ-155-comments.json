Therefore, each time the \"executeLocalTransaction()\" method is automatically called after sending a transactional message, it can only return the \"UNKNOWN\" status. As a result, I need to additionally call \"endTransaction()\" immediately after the local transaction ends to notify the Broker of the transaction status. However, the TransactionSendResult object returned by the \"sendMessageInTransaction()\" method does not have complete attributes, which prevents me from calling \"endTransaction()\".\r\n\r\nFurthermore, from a software design perspective, since TransactionSendResult inherits from SendResult, it should adhere to the Liskov Substitution Principle and have all the attribute values of
