PR doesn't look bad, but just by way of feedback, the idea has been considered in the past and, while many thought such functionality might be useful, there was also debate about possible other implementations, e.g. as one possibility, whether Groovy truth should return true or false for an existing but empty file. So, we'll probably let it sit for a little bit longer to see if anyone comments. I think this was thought of as best among multiple possibilities but at the time since there was not unanimous consensus, we decided to not go forward at the time.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/1411957968/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/1417583098","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/1852#issuecomment-1417583098","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/1852","id":1417583098,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAgdnis5Ufpn6","user":{"login":"paulk-asert","id":280016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MDAxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/280016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert","html_url":"https://github.com/paulk-asert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-05T11:47:00Z","updated_at":"2023-02-05T11:47:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@dependabot

like the idea behind these extensions. Can you create a corresponding Jira issue?\r\n\r\nAlso, some minor points:\r\n\r\n- I think using `getExtension` rather than `extension` would be closer to existing methods. WDYT?\r\n- Also, `extension` doesn't currently return empty string when there is no extension. This is what the javadocs state but not what the implementation does. The javadoc matches how Kotlin and commons-io FilenameUtils behave.\r\n- An alternative to `nameWithoutExtension` is `baseName` (what commons-io uses) or just `basename` (again, I'd go with the getter variant). I guess there is some merit in following Kotlin but `basename` would certainly be shorter.

While I think the goal of having the English equivalents is a nice idea and handy for certain DSL scenarios, I think there are enough problems to outweigh having that built-in to the language.\r\n\r\nFirstly, for code as shown in the issue, e.g. \"if(validated or administrator){\", the conditional expression will normally be parsed as the following command chain \"validated(or).administrator\". Similarly for \"and\". You would need to write \"validated.or(administrator)\" if you didn't like \"validated || administrator\" or \"validated | administrator\". So, you would need a little bit of DSL processing code with property missing or similar to actually make \"and\" and \"or\" work as described.\r\n\r\nSecondly, there might be confusion in that \"not\" isn't our mechanism for operator overloading \"!\", whereas \"or\" and \"and\" are our mechanism for overloading \"&\" and \"|\". We kind of treat \"&&\", \"||\" and \"!\" specially. We use \"asBoolean\" to override Groovy truth and then \"&&\", \"||\" and \"!\" just work with the results from Groovy truth. There is nothing stopping folks from defining their own \"not\" method, and they can tailor the definition to their DSL scenario.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/1498759057/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/1512346059","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/1884#issuecomment-1512346059","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/1884","id":1512346059,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAgdnis5aJJHL","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-18T02:27:23Z","updated_at":"2023-04-18T02:33:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"##
