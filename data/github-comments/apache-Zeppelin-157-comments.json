@jongyoul @prabhjyotsingh @felixcheung Could you help review that ? \r\nHere's some suggestion for you how to review it since it is a very large PR\r\n\r\n* The overall change is the same as I described in the design doc. I would suggest you to read the unit test first. These unit test is very readable and easy to understand what the code is doing now. InterpreterFactoryTest, InterpreterGroupTest, InterpreterSettingTest, InterpreterSettingManagerTest, RemoteInterpreterTest.\r\n* Remove the reference counting logic. Now I will kill the interpreter process as long as all the sessions in the same interpreter group is closed. (I plan to add another kind of policy for the interpreter process lifecycle control, ZEPPELIN-2197)\r\n* The RemoteFunction I introduced is for reducing code duplicates when we use RPC.\r\n* The changes in Job.java and RemoteScheduler is for fixing the race issue bug.
