In the case of a large table which has a mass of files, the final manifest may be too big.  Currently, I'm not sure what is the best way to transfer manifests between the executor and the driver. IIUC, there are two ways if we want to build manifests parallel and commit once.\r\n\r\n1.  Store the temporary manifests to some HDFS location and return location string to the driver, then the driver constructs the manifests and appends manifests and commits. While I don't find an existing API to build manifests from location, ManifestReader?  \r\n\r\n2. Implement `Serializable ` for the Manifest or Snapshot, so that we collect them and append manifests in the driver side.

What if we have truncated min/max values?\r\n\r\nI think the bounds check is safe with truncated bounds. The check is that the literal value is equal to lower and upper bounds, so we would know that there is only one value that is equal to the filter's literal. That can only happen when the bounds have not been truncated because the truncated upper bound is never equal to the truncated lower bound unless the value was already smaller than the truncation length.\r\n\r\nHere's an example: Say the real min and max are [\"aa\", \"aaaa\"] and we are truncating to 2 codepoints. Then the bounds will be [\"aa\", \"ab\"]. Because there is no value equal to both bounds, `eq` will never return `ROWS_MUST_MATCH`. Alternatively, if there is just one value, \"aa\", then both min/max and truncated bounds will be \"aa\". In that case, `eq` will detect that \"aa\" is equal to both bounds and return that the predicate is guaranteed to be true by the bounds.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/524914156/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/524938283","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/280#issuecomment-524938283","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/280","id":524938283,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNDkzODI4Mw==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-26T16:54:15Z","updated_at":"2019-08-26T16:54:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@manishmalhotrawork, those IDs have different contexts.

And also as TableMetadata knows how many fields are in partition, so can maintain the nextIDValue as well.\r\nSo, that when `PartitionSpec.partitionType` will be called, it will use the passed value as first ID and then increment.\r\n\r\nAlso the [TableMetadata#updatePartitionSpec](https://github.com/apache/incubator-iceberg/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/TableMetadata.java#L294) should also use nextIDValue to pass to PartitionSpec.\r\n\r\nDoes modifying/dropping columns also needs to be taken care, I believe not?\r\n\r\nyeah, for my understanding, a sample partitioned table manifest file's schema has this entry for partition.

The problem is that changing the partitioning for existing tables that use identity partitioning is that your queries may start fail because you're no longer producing the old partition columns (e.g., `ts_date=cast(cast(ts as date) as string)`. And if you are producing the old partition columns, then there's not much of a point to add extra time-based partitioning (splits will also be pruned using time ranges from min/max metadata).\r\n\r\nIf you don't intend to use existing data, then do normal timestamps work?\r\n\r\nI guess there's another case, where you want to rebuild the table metadata, but use old data files. In that case, is there anything to distinguish the data in these columns from timestamps with a different format, like long values that store microseconds from epoch?\r\n\r\nThe problem is correctness when other people start using this. If Iceberg supports interpreting a long column as an instant, then it must be obvious what the unit of the long type is. Maybe we could allow this if the column name includes some clue, like `timestamp_millis` vs `timestamp_micros`, but that sounds hacky to me.\r\n\r\nAnother solution is to add a way to promote from long to timestamp type and store the units of the long in metadata somewhere. Then you would be able to use old data as real timestamp columns.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/526384694/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/526397357","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/374#issuecomment-526397357","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/374","id":526397357,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNjM5NzM1Nw==","user":{"login":"chenjunjiedada","id":3960228,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NjAyMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3960228?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjunjiedada","html_url":"https://github.com/chenjunjiedada","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjunjiedada/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjunjiedada/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjunjiedada/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjunjiedada/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjunjiedada/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjunjiedada/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjunjiedada/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjunjiedada/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjunjiedada/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-29T23:24:37Z","updated_at":"2019-08-29T23:24:37Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"This time is hive test failed.\r\n```\r\n> Task :iceberg-hive:test\r\norg.apache.iceberg.hive.HiveTableTest > testConcurrentConnections FAILED\r\n    java.lang.AssertionError at HiveTableTest.java:330\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/526397357/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/526435055","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/404#issuecomment-526435055","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/404","id":526435055,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNjQzNTA1NQ==","user":{"login":"waterlx","id":13976495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTc2NDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13976495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/waterlx","html_url":"https://github.com/waterlx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waterlx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waterlx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waterlx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waterlx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waterlx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waterlx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waterlx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waterlx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waterlx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-30T02:49:43Z","updated_at":"2019-08-30T02:49:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@xabriel yes, I would like to work on this but not start it yet. \r\nBut I am not sure if this issue makes sense and its priority.

Irrespective of the field name.\r\n\r\nwondering how the cases when the new `partitionSpec` will have the old column as well, like [TestMergeAppend#testChangedPartitionSpec](https://github.com/apache/incubator-iceberg/blob/master/core/src/test/java/org/apache/iceberg/TestMergeAppend.java#L292)\r\nIt has 1st partitonSpec with `data` and then adding `data, id`. This test-case uses `Snapshot`/pending updates to verify.\r\n\r\nSo, as per our logic after adding 1st PartitonSpec, Manifest will have this schema:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        \"name\" : \"partition\",\r\n        \"type\" : {\r\n          \"type\" : \"record\",\r\n          \"name\" : \"r102\",\r\n          \"fields\" : [ {\r\n            \"name\" : \"data_bucket\",\r\n            \"type\" : [ \"null\", \"int\" ],\r\n            \"default\" : null,\r\n            \"field-id\" : 1000\r\n          }\r\n```\r\n\r\n and after adding 2nd PartitionSpec, new manifest will have this schema\r\n\r\n```\r\n        \"name\" : \"partition\",\r\n        \"type\" : {\r\n          \"type\" : \"record\",\r\n          \"name\" : \"r102\",\r\n          \"fields\" : [ {\r\n            \"name\" : \"data_bucket\",\r\n            \"type\" : [ \"null\", \"int\" ],\r\n            \"default\" : null,\r\n            \"field-id\" : 1001\r\n          }, {\r\n            \"name\" : \"id_bucket\",\r\n            \"type\" : [ \"null\", \"int\" ],\r\n            \"default\" : null,\r\n            \"field-id\" : 1002\r\n          }\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut problem is it fails when it reads 2nd manifest file in the test-case to validate the manifest files.\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.apache.avro.AvroRuntimeException: Duplicate field id_bucket in record org.apache.iceberg.PartitionData: id_bucket type:UNION pos:1 and id_bucket type:UNION pos:0.\r\n```\r\n\r\nInterestingly it fails with id_bucket as dupes, which is added only in the 2nd spec.\r\nWill debug further why this is a problem.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/526672701/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/526677751","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/429#issuecomment-526677751","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/429","id":526677751,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNjY3Nzc1MQ==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-30T17:09:16Z","updated_at":"2019-08-30T17:09:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I understand what you intend here, but I don't think there is much value to making this change.
