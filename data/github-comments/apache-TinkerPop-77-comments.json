The examples aren't integrated into the pipeline or GH actions, but they are self-contained as simple projects in their respective example folders and can be run after building.\r\n\r\nI think we should look into adding them to the main Maven build and at least add a smoke test for them (like executing the methods to ensure that no exception gets thrown) so they are covered by GH actions. Otherwise, we won't notice if we break them, e.g., by changing some API.\r\nThis probably means however that their connection parameters need to be changed as the test server doesn't listen on port `8182`. \r\n\r\n> Currently undecided on where to introduce them to users, but we could maybe add them to either the docs in each GLV section or in README files.\r\n\r\nI think a short mention in the reference docs for each GLV would be great as that is the place where we mostly document the GLVs. README files could of course also make sense, especially if the applications contain more than a single file (depending on @kenhuuu's comment) to briefly explain the application and its structure. README's are usually also what search engines will link to so that's where users will land if they didn't follow a link from somewhere else in our docs.\r\n\r\nWe should probably also remove the current Gremlin.Net.Template ([docs](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/reference/#gremlin-dotnet-examples) [src](https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/tree/master/gremlin-dotnet/src/Gremlin.Net.Template)) as it basically served the same purpose and we don't need two example applications for .NET.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1778870093/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1779018372","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/2298#issuecomment-1779018372","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/2298","id":1779018372,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc5qCaqE","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-25T11:02:29Z","updated_at":"2023-10-25T11:02:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> This probably means however that their connection parameters need to be changed as the test server doesn't listen on port 8182.\r\n\r\nif we use a nonstandard port i think it would be good to ensure the comments are clear that the standard port is 8182.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1779018372/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1779115280","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/2298#issuecomment-1779115280","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/2298","id":1779115280,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc5qCyUQ","user":{"login":"FlorianHockmann","id":21224336,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjI0MzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21224336?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann","html_url":"https://github.com/FlorianHockmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-25T12:01:36Z","updated_at":"2023-10-25T12:01:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Maybe I'm also overcautious here and we don't need any tests.

I will take a closer look at your changes later today or tomorrow. I wanted to explain our process a bit first though.\r\n\r\nThe best places to discuss issues and changes before development will either be through our [JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/TINKERPOP/) (used for issue tracking) or through the [dev@tinkerpop.apache.org](mailto:dev@tinkerpop.apache.org) maillist. You can subscribe to the dev list if you would like by sending an email to [dev-subscribe@tinkerpop.apache.org](mailto:dev-subscribe@tinkerpop.apache.org). You may need a PMC member to help activate a JIRA account, you can request help with this here, on the dev list, or in the TinkerPop [discord server](https://discord.gg/tinkerpop).\r\n\r\nIn order for the changes to get accepted, they will need 3 approving votes from TinkerPop committers. For smaller PR's that usually does not take too long.\r\n\r\nOne additional thing to note here is that your branch is based off of master. The master branch is where we accumulate breaking changes for the next major release (in this case 4.0.0), if your changes are non-breaking and you would like them included in an older release line, please rebase the branch and retarget the PR to the oldest appropriate dev branch. For example, if you want your changes included in the upcoming 3.6.6 and 3.7.1 releases, the PR should target 3.6-dev. Please let me know if you need any help with this or have any further questions.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1785680016/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1785721381","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/2314#issuecomment-1785721381","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/2314","id":1785721381,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc5qb_Il","user":{"login":"divad1196","id":43037556,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDM3NTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43037556?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/divad1196","html_url":"https://github.com/divad1196","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divad1196/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divad1196/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divad1196/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divad1196/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divad1196/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divad1196/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divad1196/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divad1196/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divad1196/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-30T17:31:10Z","updated_at":"2023-10-30T17:31:10Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi

I will try to find some time assemble something there soon. The official contributing guidelines can be found [here](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/dev/developer/#_contributing_code_changes), although the discoverability and accessibility could likely be improved. As for your question about getting changes into 3.6.6 and 3.7.1, it comes from the way we merge PR's. When a PR gets accepted into 3.6-dev, the committer who merges it in will also merge that change up to 3.7-dev and master to ensure that it also ends up in newer branches. We always merge changes up the branches, but not down.\r\n\r\nAs for your changes here, I took a closer look today and I think there is more consideration needed before we can proceed further. The first question is if the \"script-only\" mode would bring benefit to any systems beyond CosmosDB. While I do have some sympathy regarding incompatibilities, if CosmosDB is the only outlier here, I would much rather see them unify behind the standard TinkerPop system rather than fracture our drivers with additional configurations. One of my long term goals for TinkerPop would be to have the number of configurations for drivers and servers reduced significantly. Additionally, I really want to reduce the differentiation between all of our drivers. We currently have too many features which are exclusive to only a few of our drivers. For that reason, if we accept this change, it would require us to prioritize adding similar capabilities to the other drivers (Java, go, .net, js) sometime in the near future.\r\n\r\nI think this is a decision which would need a [dev-list](mailto:dev@tinkerpop.apache.org) discussion before proceeding in order to decide if this is a direction the community would like to move in. If the community does want to accept these changes, some tests would need to be written for this PR to ensure that the driver remains compatible with gremlin-server with `bytecode_allowed=False`.\r\n\r\nOverall I think it is an interesting change, and it definitely looks valuable for CosmosDB users, but I'm not sure if extending the drivers to support outdated systems is the right direction for TinkerPop at this time.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1788329164/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1788479976","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/2314#issuecomment-1788479976","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/2314","id":1788479976,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc5qmgno","user":{"login":"divad1196","id":43037556,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDM3NTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43037556?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/divad1196","html_url":"https://github.com/divad1196","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divad1196/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divad1196/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divad1196/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divad1196/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divad1196/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divad1196/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divad1196/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divad1196/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divad1196/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-01T06:28:34Z","updated_at":"2023-11-01T06:28:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi,\n\nOnce again, thank you for the detailed response and the explanation. I thought that you would merge up the commits but I felt like it was a lot of manual work. So thank you for the work here also. For the contribution guide, your initial message would be a good basis, or just adding the link to the readme would be a first step.\n\n\nFor the reasons of being able to force the string mode: debug, retrocompatibility (e.g database never upgraded) or interoperability (having a gremlin-like query system doesn't mean it has anything to do with tinkerpop. In CosmosDB, `Order.desc` is `decr`)\n\nEven if there is only one database concerned, the marketshare must be considered. CosmosDB is Azure graph database and a lot of person what to use that. Many changed to neo4j or memgraph and use the official library instead. Also, I thought it might be something planned because I saw that the translator wasn't available in 3.4.3 but was in 3.7.0. What would the use-cases be otherwise, except maybe to write unit tests?\n\nOn another topic, even though I think that this feature would be needed in every language (I can add it to java/js if the translator exists already), I think that wanting to keep all languages with the same features is slowing down their respective evolutions. Especially, there are not as easy to improve and the same utility libraries won't be available in all languages and we cannot take advantage of the language specific features. Let me know what you think about it.\n\nRegarding the tests, I think that at some point we should mock a server (or the request library use in the client) to see what is sent.

Discord is good to help build out a broader TinkerPop community, but according to Apache guidelines, any development decisions about the project need to happen on the dev-list.\r\n\r\nAs for the testing, we currently have a set of Gherkin tests which are used by all of our drivers. Each test scenario runs a traversal through the driver connected to a gremlin-server instance, and asserts that the correct results come back. I believe the best solution for testing here would be to adapt these existing tests to utilize your driver configuration. I can examples of these tests if we need them after the dev-list discussion.\r\n\r\nOne final thing to note here is that while there are translators for each GLV, they are not all fully featured. They all handle basic/core gremlin well but they are not perfect. There was a bunch of additions to the Python translator that just got merged in the last few weeks. To the best of my knowledge the python translator is now complete, however there were some substantial gaps in it prior to these recent changes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1789639084/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1789698764","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/2322#issuecomment-1789698764","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/2322","id":1789698764,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc5qrKLM","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-01T21:15:51Z","updated_at":"2023-11-08T13:09:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## [Codecov](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/tinkerpop/pull/2322?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=apache) Report\n> Merging [#2322](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/tinkerpop/pull/2322?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=apache) (f408954) into [3.6-dev](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/tinkerpop/commit/0cf6da8d543870a80eabb0661c530df3ff90dc5b?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=apache) (0cf6da8) will **increase** coverage by `0.01%`.\n> The diff coverage is `97.82%`.\n\n> :exclamation: Current head f408954 differs from pull request most recent head 473d3fc.

The tests run sequentially. Even with a pool size of 1, and even with an artificial wait time between tests, the results from Gremlin Server are randomly missing vertex properties. It seems to be only vertex properties. They are added on one unit test, and are missing on the next. It all goes away when the server is configured to run on one thread only.\r\n\r\nThe main question here is: Is it expected that TinkerTransactionGraph in sessionless mode may exhibit non durable updates, even when requests are run sequentially, even with some wait time? It seems, as it is currently, that it's only to expected to work reliably when requests are run on the same thread each. If that is the case, my PR makes sense. If it's not the case, there might be a bug in TinkerTransactionGraph.\r\n\r\nI will continue to try to reproduce this reliably.\r\n\r\n\r\n
