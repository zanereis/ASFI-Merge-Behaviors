The things I changed were:\r\n\r\n1. I double-checked I had the latest helm chart by pulling the pulsar repo again (git reported a couple of updates on master).\r\n2. I placed all my nodes in the same availability zone (I am on AWS EKS).\r\n3. I Added to client.close() on a SIGTERM to all my client code, in case it was unclosed connections causing an error.\r\n4. I replaced the nodes in my EKS cluster with bigger nodes.\r\n\r\nSo I'm not sure what made the difference, but its working ok now.

\r\n\r\nI think the problem is that you didn't set the right settings so the functions end up using the service URLs in the worker config. When a Function Worker is running along with a broker, the service URLs are set to the broker IP addresses. So when you submit a function, the functions will end up using the broker service URLs.\r\n\r\nIn order to make this work correctly, you have to set the service URLs in the Kubernetes runtime config like the following.

This is something that I think has never worked, but very useful\r\n> \r\n> Can you provide a way to reproduce? In functions, sinks and sources, `--topics-pattern` will be deprecated, can you use `--inputs` replace it? [--input] and [--topic-pattern] are mutually exclusive.\r\n\r\n@wolfstudy what you are referring to is probably this line https://github.com/oncodeit/pulsar/blob/71b3819bfc11afe0f0da19df0a19e3b7a05988c5/pulsar-client-tools/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/admin/cli/CmdSinks.java#L258\r\nbut this involves only the name of the pattern parameter\r\n\r\nTo reproduce: take any connector from Pulsar IO, a sink in this case. \r\nhttps://archive.apache.org/dist/pulsar/pulsar-2.5.1/connectors/\r\n\r\nFollow these steps: https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/en/standalone/#install-builtin-connectors-optional\r\n\r\nLaunch the connector with:\r\n```\r\n./pulsar-admin sinks create --tenant public --namespace default --name test-sink --sink-type jdbc  --sink-config-file <the yaml config file>  --topicsPattern \"persistent://public/default/.*\"\r\n```\r\n\r\ncontent of the yaml:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"userName\": \"root\",\r\n    \"password\": \"jdbc\",\r\n    \"jdbcUrl\": \"jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:3306/pulsar_mysql_jdbc_sink\",\r\n    \"tableName\": \"pulsar_mysql_jdbc_sink\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen retry using:\r\n```\r\n./pulsar-admin sinks create --tenant public --namespace default --name test-sink --sink-type jdbc  --sink-config-file <the yaml config file>  --topicsPattern \"non-persistent://public/default/.*\"\r\n```\r\nYou will notice that the connector will now works.\r\n\r\nI posted this example with jdbc/mysql but you can try with anything you prefer, the behaviour is the same.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/625288758/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/625289104","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/6862#issuecomment-625289104","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/6862","id":625289104,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNTI4OTEwNA==","user":{"login":"hangc0276","id":5436568,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MzY1Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5436568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hangc0276","html_url":"https://github.com/hangc0276","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hangc0276/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hangc0276/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hangc0276/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hangc0276/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hangc0276/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hangc0276/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hangc0276/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hangc0276/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hangc0276/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-07T14:27:44Z","updated_at":"2020-05-07T14:27:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@codelipenghui When batch receive triggered by timeout, it should trigger send permit to broker server in `MultiTopicsConsumerImpl`.
