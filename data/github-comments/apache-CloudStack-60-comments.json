I looked at the code and did not find any sleep or any sort of wait, so looping 30 times will go quite fast:\nThe block inside the for loop would be this one:\n           while read line; do\n             if [[ $line == cmdline:\\* ]]; then\n               cmd=${line//cmdline:/}\n               echo $cmd > /var/cache/cloud/cmdline\n             elif [[ $line == pubkey:\\* ]]; then\n               pubkey=${line//pubkey:/}\n               echo $pubkey > /var/cache/cloud/authorized_keys\n               echo $pubkey > /root/.ssh/authorized_keys\n             fi\n           done < /dev/vport0p1\n           # In case of reboot we do not send the boot args again.\n           # So, no need to wait for them, as the boot args are already set at startup\n           if [ -s /var/cache/cloud/cmdline  ]\n           then\n               log_it \"Found a non empty cmdline file. Will now exit the loop and proceed with configuration.\"\n               break;\n           fi\nIf my assumption is right, about the 30 times loop, I would suggest to do it in a different way. For example:\nlocal factor=2\nlocal progress=1\nfor i in {1..5}\ndo\n    #block mentioned above\n    sleep ${progress}\n    progress=$[ progress \\* factor]\ndone\nIn a worst case scenario we would wait 16 seconds before then leave the for loop.\nWhat do you think?\nCheers,\nWilder\n—\nReply to this email directly or view it on

However, the identifier and name of these networks is made available to vSphere so that host and virtual machine virtual ethernet device can connect to them.\n\nIn order to connect a vm's virtual ethernet device to the proper opaque network when deploying a vm into a NSX managed network, we first need to look for a particular opaque network on hosts. This opaque network's id has to be **\"br-int\"** and its type **\"nsx.network\"**.\n\nSince vSphere API version 5.5 [HostNetworkInfo](https://www.vmware.com/support/developer/converter-sdk/conv55_apireference/vim.host.NetworkInfo.html#opaqueNetwork) introduces a list of available opaque networks for each host. \nIf NSX API version >= 4.2 we look for a [OpaqueNetworkInfo](https://www.vmware.com/support/developer/converter-sdk/conv55_apireference/vim.host.OpaqueNetworkInfo.html) which satisfies:\n- opaqueNetworkId = \"br-int\"\n- opaqueNetworkType = \"nsx.netork\"\n\nIf that opaque network is found, then we need to attach vm's NIC to a virtual ethernet device which support this, so we use [VirtualEthernetCardOpaqueNetworkBackingInfo](https://www.vmware.com/support/developer/converter-sdk/conv55_apireference/vim.vm.device.VirtualEthernetCard.OpaqueNetworkBackingInfo.html) setting:\n- opaqueNetworkId = \"br-int\"\n- opaqueNetworkType = \"nsx.netork\"\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/150012697/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/150022222","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/939#issuecomment-150022222","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/939","id":150022222,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MDAyMjIyMg==","user":{"login":"borisroman","id":5996146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5OTYxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5996146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisroman","html_url":"https://github.com/borisroman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisroman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisroman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisroman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisroman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisroman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisroman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisroman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisroman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisroman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-21T20:57:49Z","updated_at":"2015-10-21T20:57:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM :+1: \n\n@remibergsma Would it be possible to merge this?

From that sense, IMHO - test setup method is not coded to handle the possibility of configuration not being present and hence needs a fix.   \n\nJust my 2 cents,  I would like to skip a test if I don't have the configuration.  As a person running the BVTs, I will check all the test status and cannot ignore skipped tests.   Also, BVTs are run every time when the build is kicked off.  If people keep adding their own tests which not everyone can run then the importance of BVTs is gone and we will never achieve 100% passrate.  If someone has specific tests they want to run, keep it in a different folder and not keep it in smoke folder. Also, skipping tests is designed for a purpose.  \n\n@runseb we should establish some ground rules around BVTs otherwise we will have to do conditional coding for running tests which is hard to maintain.  \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/150168452/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/150168660","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/963#issuecomment-150168660","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/963","id":150168660,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MDE2ODY2MA==","user":{"login":"wilderrodrigues","id":5129209,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMjkyMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5129209?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues","html_url":"https://github.com/wilderrodrigues","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-22T10:09:17Z","updated_at":"2015-10-22T10:09:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @ustcweizhou \n\nHow did you test it?

think you guys agree on the problem but disagree on the solution.\nTo me 100% success on BVT, if it includes ~20% (or whatever percentage) of skipped tests is not a real 100% success rate on BVT.\n\nSo @miguelaferreira prefers to see 80% success on BVT and vote +1 on a release, if he actually knows what's happening with the 20% failure.\nWhile @nitt10prashant and @pvr9711 you seem to want 100% success on BVT even if it includes some tests that are actually not run.\n\nThe nicira test is actually the only one in there that's testing a third party plugin. I don't see any tests for solidfire, netscaler, open contrail, midokura etc….All theses tests will fail without the proper hardware/software setup and hence will fail with simulator run.\n\nIf we really want 100% on integration tests (so called BVT) we need to define a test suite that everyone can run without special hardware or software. And those tests _cannot_ be skipped.\n\nI personally fail to see the benefit of skipped tests versus a failed test.\n\nFor this particular tests I propose we move it to a folder /test/integration/plugins and have our base tests defining \"BVT\" as the test in /test/integration/smoke\n\nSo -1 on this PR\n+1 on a PR that would move this test to a separate folder.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/150178317/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/150185163","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/960#issuecomment-150185163","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/960","id":150185163,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MDE4NTE2Mw==","user":{"login":"miguelaferreira","id":4670993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NzA5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4670993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira","html_url":"https://github.com/miguelaferreira","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-22T11:24:41Z","updated_at":"2015-10-22T11:24:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The directory in which a test lives is irrelevant to me, so I would also +1 a PR that moves this to another directory.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/150185163/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/150203517","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/962#issuecomment-150203517","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/962","id":150203517,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MDIwMzUxNw==","user":{"login":"karuturi","id":186833,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjgzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/186833?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi","html_url":"https://github.com/karuturi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-22T12:20:01Z","updated_at":"2015-10-22T12:20:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for taking this up @snuf.

personally fail to see the benefit of skipped tests versus a failed test\"\nIf i may ,\nskip  is a type of failure where you know in advance  about failure  , since you know about the failure you just Handle them  in order to differentiate from a general failure(may be product issue).So its all about categorizing  the failure  like expected failure and unexpected failure \n\nIts about how you see reports \nIf you accept skip as known failure then 100% success on BVT ~ 20% of skipped =80% success with 20% of known failure ,at least not a product issue which you can say  without looking at particular script .\nWithout skip  you have to analyze each and every failure then you may come up with % of product  issue and % of failure due to setup an all\n\n\"While @nitt10prashant and @pvr9711 you seem to want 100% success on BVT even if it includes some tests that are actually not run.\"\nMy comment:\n1-Not run test cases are  the  one which are not picked up by runner may be coz of different tags and those test cases will not appear  in your report \n2-skipped test case are the one which are picked up by runner but due to non availability of configurations or some other reasons  could not run completely  and they will appear in your report .\n3-I want 100% success on BVT  without any skip  if all the setup config is available .incase they are not i would prefer to skip them in order to find out real failure  which does not include any failure because of setup/configuration  just by looking at my report
