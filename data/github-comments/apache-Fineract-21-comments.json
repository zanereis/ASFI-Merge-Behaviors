Functionality is addressed correctly based on maturity instruction requirements. \r\n\r\n@Ippezrobert \r\n\r\n> MFI has a max of 1 yr Deposit Term but a client would wish to fix for 2 yrs, so the MFI accepts this offer and manages the 2 yrs period in shifts internally. So after the 1 yr is done, the MFI would like the rollover to be managed automatically by the system since chances that a new FD will be created exactly on the same date of maturity is small since an officer can forget to check if this FD is matured or not yet a client would be counting when the two years would end. So there needs to be a job scheduler to check maturity date for FD and also rollover options so that it (system can take appropriate decisions (to reinvest of just close and transfer interest and principal to linked savings).\r\n\r\nCorrect.\r\n\r\n> To be discussed: Will the system use the same account number or new one will be created????\r\n\r\nSystem will create new FD account with new account no at the time of maturity.\r\n\r\n> A client would like to reinvest FD voluntarily since he sees no use for his money for some time. He then has to decides what amount or portion to reinvest after the first maturity is expired. Option can include rollover of principal only, rollover of principal and interest, transfer of balance to another account (make linked account dynamic .ie ability to select loan, shares or savings account and also a GL Account), etc\r\n\r\nScope of this feature was to address maturity instructions. Voluntary reinvest feature can be enhanced separately. Only savings account can be linked - not loan, share or GL account. Principal, Interest & P&I are the options - partial amount support (flat/%?) wasn't communicated earlier as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n> If the selected option involves rollover, a Rollover End Date should be entered i.e the date when you want the rollover transaction to stop.\r\n\r\nThis does seem to be a design flaw.  All of us missed this observation. Workaround can be manually closing the FD to prevent rollover instructions triggering for a 2nd time.\r\n\r\n> If the option selected in After Maturity does not involve the roll over of interest with the principal, the option of linked account is mandatory .ie account to which the transfer will be made at maturity. \r\n\r\nCorrect.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/634103281/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/634179700","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/937#issuecomment-634179700","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/937","id":634179700,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzNDE3OTcwMA==","user":{"login":"xurror","id":45751948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NzUxOTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45751948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xurror","html_url":"https://github.com/xurror","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xurror/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xurror/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xurror/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xurror/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xurror/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xurror/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xurror/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xurror/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xurror/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-26T17:54:34Z","updated_at":"2020-05-26T17:54:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"/rebase","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/634179700/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/634208558","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/939#issuecomment-634208558","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/939","id":634208558,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzNDIwODU1OA==","user":{"login":"thesmallstar","id":42006277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMDA2Mjc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42006277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar","html_url":"https://github.com/thesmallstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-26T18:47:25Z","updated_at":"2020-05-26T18:47:25Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@vorburger

class which could easily have the same ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException and how I said that instead of `isEmpty()` you can make the code more robust by checking for the condition which actually causes an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` ? So just \"hardening\" the code in this class, in all places where this can happen, would fix FINERACT-933, which is the goal here.

But I'd like to fully understand exactly what we are doing here a little more myself, before merging it... please know that, even though I've originally suggested you look into Spotless in FINERACT-1006, I've actually not read much about it myself... :smile: so I'm looking for your guidance to fully learn about it myself.\r\n\r\nIn order to make a full review and merging more easy and avoid conflicts, could I make a suggestion, just from a \"practical\" point of view? How about in this PR, you revert the .java code changes and ONLY propose whatever we need to add to Gradle (and README, hopefully?) and config files, but do not actually include the result of having run it to change the Java files? That makes it easier for me to completely review it properly, and hopefully eventually merge. We could then, in a separate next step, actually run and merge the result (or I could just do that myself, and merge it \"quickly\", to avoid delays).\r\n\r\nOne thing I haven't completely understood yet here is if this \"just\" adds a new way to Auto Format by launching a certain Gradle task (include doc in README...) or if this, like Checkstyle and Error Prone & Co. will actually verify formatting, and fail the build? Or is the idea that we leave that up to Checkstyle only, but that folks can then use this to make changes comply? Or both? It's something worth clearly documenting in the README, IMHO.\r\n\r\nI guess what would be \"ideal\" is if this would both verify formatting, fail the build if NOK (like Checkstyle; I wouldn't mind if this PR fails to build, because of that), but if such failures would show a clear message à la \"Hey buddy, you can easily fix your code's ugly formatting by running `./gradlew something`....

Spotless(Based on the configuration) is more about code formatting and checkstyle is a little bit more intelligent than just code formatting(Not a very good explanation). \r\n\r\nKeeping both seems a good idea, there are a few checks like naming conventions which cannot be handled by spotless whereas some like indentation/whitespace it would be a really good idea to let spotless take \"more\" care of it since adding those spaces myself after writing some code would be really troublesome, having said that for a few checks like \"space\" where spotless and checkstyle agree on everything(either both pass or both fail) we can add a note in check style error message to use spotless to fix this(makes sense?) and keep them both place. Only for a few checks, where they won't agree but it would be a really nice idea to have it automated(like indentation), we can let only spotless handle it. \r\n\r\nThis is what I think would be a
