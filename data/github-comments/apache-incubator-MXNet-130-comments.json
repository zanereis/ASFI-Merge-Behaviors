Actually I have implemented s2s+attention NMT model with mxnet and got state-of-the-art result on IWSLT data. However, the training speed is not very fast. According to this benchmark https://github.com/guolinke/deep-learning-benchmarks/blob/master/result.md , mxnet is faster than other tools for the FCN models but slower for LSTM. I am really curious about the reason. But this is just a reference since I don't really believe that Theano is much faster than Torch.\r\n\r\nAnd about the CUDNN speed up. Our group has built a DL framework from scratch and we are planning to leverage CUDNN to speed up training. We can only get 2 times speed up at most since our tool is already very fast for RNN models (because of some optimization for RNN). So I am thinking that if mxnet can have some optimization for RNN models without the support of CUDNN?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/262431692/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/262433056","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/3930#issuecomment-262433056","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/3930","id":262433056,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MjQzMzA1Ng==","user":{"login":"sxjscience","id":5178350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzgzNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5178350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience","html_url":"https://github.com/sxjscience","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-23T04:34:10Z","updated_at":"2016-11-23T04:34:10Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@magic282 Yes, we need to include such a benchmark.
