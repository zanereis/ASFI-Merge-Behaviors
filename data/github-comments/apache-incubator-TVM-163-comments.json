The thing that concerns me is the lack of support for composite operators. I know this is mentioned on a to-do, but registering the 'is supported' logic as an operator attribute is not something we can do with composite functions in the current implementation. Do you have a proposal on how you're going to support composite functions?\r\n\r\nSince we are still discussing the naming and format of the pass sequence for annotation, this PR does not consider composite functions yet. The follow-up PR will update the annotation pass to annotate not only ops but also functions (with the composite attribute).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/590980676/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/590983662","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4937#issuecomment-590983662","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4937","id":590983662,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5MDk4MzY2Mg==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-25T17:41:18Z","updated_at":"2020-02-25T17:41:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"NOTE: the CI image won't be updated automatically as per script.

Merge composite resolves that many-to-one problem by ensuring all mappings are one-to-one or one-to-many. That way you could just treat composite functions equivalently to operators in the annotation pass (and partitioning pass). But just because some ops are merged does not imply they are supported, it just formats them in a way that can be easily handled in the annotation pass.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't the intention to add the 'is supported' check into merge composite as it's just a structural pattern matcher. The logic in FTVMAnnotateTarget can get quite complicated and won't be expressable as a pattern.\r\n\r\nIf composite functions don't get annotated as supported, they should still be valid Relay. If having them interferes with further lowering passes, then yes we'd need an 'inline composite' pass after.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/591083262/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/591105578","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4933#issuecomment-591105578","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4933","id":591105578,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5MTEwNTU3OA==","user":{"login":"zhiics","id":5145158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDUxNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5145158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics","html_url":"https://github.com/zhiics","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-25T22:31:12Z","updated_at":"2020-02-25T22:31:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@mbaret Thanks for all discussions.

In particular, the current TVM runtime API won't use non standard int for exchange (e.g. explicitly use int64_t). \r\n\r\nI do not mean to make use of the current TVM runtime. Instead,  I think we should create a ```crt_runtime_api.c``` that implements the functions in https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/blob/master/include/tvm/runtime/c_runtime_api.h. \r\n\r\nThis implementation will serve two purposes:\r\n- The C API is relatively stable API that we can rely on, and we can use it to expose CRT to frontend languages like python\r\n- Optionally, the user can still make use of the internal CRT API, however, I do think we should think about streamline the API a bit, and see if we would like to provide some extra things.\r\n\r\nNote that the API interface does not have any opinion in terms of the system call functions being used(malloc vs static page allocation), so it should be MISRA compatible.\r\n\r\nHaving a stable API would also allows us to

I hate breaking the build, so there's #4948, for expediency.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/591574746/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/591578182","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4873#issuecomment-591578182","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4873","id":591578182,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5MTU3ODE4Mg==","user":{"login":"anijain2305","id":13822661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODIyNjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13822661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305","html_url":"https://github.com/anijain2305","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-26T18:40:26Z","updated_at":"2020-02-26T18:40:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@zhiics I agree we need more clarity over the usage of opt_level=4. Thinking more about this, I feel that opt_level=4 is more like a placeholder for all the passes, that will not be a part of default Relay build pipeline. I don't think we intend to use opt_level=4 to call these passes. Calling these passes should be either from outside or by using `required_pass`. If that is truly the case, maybe we should not even have an opt_level for such passes.\r\n\r\nAs far as this PR is concerned, I think we are ok.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/591578182/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/591579730","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4873#issuecomment-591579730","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4873","id":591579730,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5MTU3OTczMA==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-26T18:43:54Z","updated_at":"2020-02-26T18:43:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"It is a bit pre-mature to introduce additional opt levels as we add passes. how about we only support the `required_pass` option for now","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/591579730/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/591579992","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4873#issuecomment-591579992","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4873","id":591579992,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5MTU3OTk5Mg==","user":{"login":"zhiics","id":5145158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDUxNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5145158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics","html_url":"https://github.com/zhiics","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-26T18:44:32Z","updated_at":"2020-02-26T18:44:32Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Yes, I am okay to use required_pass for now.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/591579992/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
