seems that sending data over ib0 is failed. you can double check with it by pull the recent ps-lite, where receiving is also logged.\n\ni also added a `--host-ip` option in the mpi tracker, see https://github.com/dmlc/ps-lite/commit/f2ab107e2d72123d653633e60be2202bd59a5432\n\nif you start your job on gcn8 with ib0, can you add the option `--host-ip 10.202.203.89` and try again?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/200069792/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/200079309","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/1623#issuecomment-200079309","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1623","id":200079309,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwMDA3OTMwOQ==","user":{"login":"vcodreanu","id":7404928,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDQ5Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7404928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vcodreanu","html_url":"https://github.com/vcodreanu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vcodreanu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vcodreanu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vcodreanu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vcodreanu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vcodreanu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vcodreanu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vcodreanu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vcodreanu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vcodreanu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-22T23:33:44Z","updated_at":"2016-03-22T23:33:44Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"yes,
