However, I have a few questions:\r\n1. Since I am not using docker currently, I should install docker as first step? I see that they offer a [Docker CE download for Debian](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-server-debian/plans/docker-ce-server-debian-tier?tab=instructions). Is this correct?\r\n2. To generate the image for my Raspberry Pi 3 with Raspbian, I would just need to do the following - $ docker build -f Dockerfile.build.armv7 -t ~/mxnet . Is that correct? Should I start with a new clean Raspbian or can I just delete the current mxnet directory? Do I have to remove all the installed libraries? Does it matter if I was to do it with Jessie or Stretch?\r\n3. In the Dockerfile.build.armv7, there is a line that says ENV BUILD_OPTS \"USE_OPENCV=0 USE_BLAS=openblas USE_SSE=0\". Since I do want to use openCV with my MXNet build, should I set the USE_OPENCV flag to 1?\r\n4. Just to make sure, in the [original MXNet instructions I was following](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/get_started/install.html), I had to manually install some dependencies, like git, cmake, etc.. Using Dockerfile.build.armv7, all dependencies will be handled by the docker file.\r\n\r\nAgain, thanks for your help. Please also add other pointers that I might have missed from my questions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/329571950/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/329594443","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/7698#issuecomment-329594443","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/7698","id":329594443,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyOTU5NDQ0Mw==","user":{"login":"piiswrong","id":568948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODk0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong","html_url":"https://github.com/piiswrong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-14T20:08:13Z","updated_at":"2017-09-14T20:08:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jermainewang
