the related PR.

Also some users might be used in using the button and look for it. Open for discussion/change, but left it out for now.\r\n* Didn't change the color on \"Filter List\" to our brand-primary, just because it was a bit tricky to do that. It currently uses a borderless button because it's a dropdown button (menu expands as you click it, and it's a bootstrap thing. When removing the hack showing the border, it overflowed and I was not in the mood for css tweaking today :) I agree that this is confusing though.

I think they come from all over the place.

We've been talking about implementing a mini geo-store service inside Superset at Lyft. In Lyft's fork we've done some work in that direction. Things like joining zip codes to their visual representation.\r\n\r\nAnother idea, how about migrating this visualization out as a plugin?
