If there are replica tasks, once one of them finishes publishing their segments, the remaining replicas are asked to stop, but these tasks haven't failed per se even though nothing was published, and marking them as failed tasks would not lead to a good experience.\r\n\r\nForcibly killing the task after a timeout so they return a failure status seems like a good solution to me. In the future, having more detailed return/error codes from tasks would be even better so that you could quickly determine why the task stopped running without having to dig through logs from the task or overlord.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/297241259/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/297244325","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/4193#issuecomment-297244325","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4193","id":297244325,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NzI0NDMyNQ==","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-26T05:46:39Z","updated_at":"2017-04-26T05:46:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@gianm you're right.

there in work in progress regard geo index and queries ?\r\nfor wgs84 coordinates, the euclidian distance is indeed the wrong one to use.\r\nSome workaround that I thought about could be to reprocess the data before indexing to druid by \r\nprojecting wgs84 coordinates (latitude, longitude) to a cartesian coordinates system (x, y, z)\r\nThen the euclidian distance can give good enough estimation to the distance between 2 points (especially important for the radius filter), however I was not able to index spatialDimensions using 3 points (x,y,z), I did managed to index only using 2 points (x,y), however using only 2 points with the  euclidian distance give wrong results.

(3.2) there's no need to wait for _handoff_ (meaning historical nodes loading the data), we just need to wait for publishing.\r\n\r\nRegular NumberedShardSpecs should be fine.
