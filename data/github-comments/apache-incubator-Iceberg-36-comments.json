For example, if a node is misconfigured and its timestamp is a year in the future, we don't want to either make up a timestamp like `max(lastUpdated+1, now)` because that perpetuates the problem. We also can't just wait until `now > lastUpdated` because that might be a long time and would DOS the table. What I concluded was that we might have timestamps that are off and that has to be okay.\r\n\r\nGiven that, I think that the current check for `lastUpdatedMillis` in `TableMetadata` should be considered the bug.

So if I had a users table, I might have a delete file with a single column, user_id with a field ID that matches the data files.\r\n\r\nThink about the design again, assume the CDC case that we have a table with (id, a) two columns, and `id` is primary key. and the CDC events come as the orders in an iceberg transaction: \r\n\r\n```\r\nt0,  INSERT(1,2);\r\nt1,  DELETE(1,2);\r\nt2,  INSERT(1,3);\r\n```\r\nAs you said, we will produce two different files for this transaction, one is data file and another one is delete differential file. so the data file will have: \r\n\r\n```\r\n(1,2);\r\n(1,3);\r\n```\r\n\r\nand deletion file will only have the primary key column (as you said if I understand correctly): \r\n\r\n```\r\n(1);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen we do the merge on read, I guess both `(1,2)` and `(1,3)` will be deleted by the `(1)`, while actually we should return the row `(1,3)` because the `DELETE(1,2)` should only remove the record `INSERT(1,2)`.\r\n\r\nSo I'm thinking that for equality-delete, we will need to keep all columns in the delete differential files so that we could get ride of this issue (say INSERT and DELETE the same record few times in a single iceberg transaction).\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/645207673/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/645208019","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/1116#issuecomment-645208019","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1116","id":645208019,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0NTIwODAxOQ==","user":{"login":"edgarRd","id":266670,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjY3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/266670?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd","html_url":"https://github.com/edgarRd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-17T07:38:20Z","updated_at":"2020-06-17T07:45:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm able to reproduce the failure on `org.apache.iceberg.data.TestLocalScan testFilterWithDateAndTimestamp[1]` - not the one in `org.apache.iceberg.orc.TestOrcMetrics > testMetricsForTopLevelFields` but I assume the latter is result a change decreasing lowerBound by `1` in date lower bounds, right?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/645208019/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/645218608","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1095#issuecomment-645218608","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1095","id":645218608,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0NTIxODYwOA==","user":{"login":"hzfanxinxin","id":11593166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTkzMTY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11593166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfanxinxin","html_url":"https://github.com/hzfanxinxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfanxinxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfanxinxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfanxinxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfanxinxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfanxinxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfanxinxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfanxinxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfanxinxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfanxinxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-17T07:59:42Z","updated_at":"2020-06-17T07:59:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rdblue would you please help to review again, thanks.

Only when the tests are run one after the other does it fail. I haven't debugged this deeply, but my best guess is that ORC uses ThreadLocals to store the local timezone (https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/204d8525bf48bf85d15feb427e6f5a31ec192bac/storage-api/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/serde2/io/DateWritable.java#L48). And these ThreadLocals are not getting reset across tests which causes subsequent tests to reuse the timezones of previous tests. I tried to run the test for each timezone in a different thread within the for loop and the tests pass. So I don't think there is a bug in the conversion logic from Expression to ORC SearchArgument, but rather in how ORC chooses to maintain the current timezone as a thread local.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/645818922/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/645851936","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/1116#issuecomment-645851936","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1116","id":645851936,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0NTg1MTkzNg==","user":{"login":"edgarRd","id":266670,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjY3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/266670?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd","html_url":"https://github.com/edgarRd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-18T08:02:13Z","updated_at":"2020-06-18T08:02:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@shardulm94 right, I did notice that the tests pass individually.
