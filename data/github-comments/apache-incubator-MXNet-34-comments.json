So if you try to use it, you get undefined symbol. For example, Executor::Bind(), and xxx::Create() functions are not exported by default.\n\nBy using MXNET_API, we can fix the undefined symbol problem, but then we face the class layout problem. Different compiler/compiler options results in different class layout, thus calling C++ API from dynamic library is a bad idea. This is also a problem for Linux, if you use GCC -O2 to compile the .so file, and then use GCC -O0 to compile mlp.\n\nThe only safe way to use dynamic library is to use only C api, which is well defined and compatible across different compilers. I have just started writing a C++ wrapper on top of the C API(https://github.com/hjk41/mxnet/blob/cpp/example/cpp/MxNetCpp.h). Maybe we can work together on the wrapper. And we probably should setup a standalone project as we did for MxNet.jl.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/166261871/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/166268712","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/987#issuecomment-166268712","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/987","id":166268712,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NjI2ODcxMg==","user":{"login":"zhangchen-qinyinghua","id":5279087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNzkwODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5279087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangchen-qinyinghua","html_url":"https://github.com/zhangchen-qinyinghua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangchen-qinyinghua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangchen-qinyinghua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangchen-qinyinghua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangchen-qinyinghua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangchen-qinyinghua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangchen-qinyinghua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangchen-qinyinghua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangchen-qinyinghua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangchen-qinyinghua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-21T10:47:29Z","updated_at":"2015-12-21T10:47:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@hjk41

from the perspective of a single machine I think what you should do is a benchmark of an RNN model and measure both compilation times and run times.

I'm a user of Theano, but I'm well aware of it slow compile speeds on RNN models, and am not aware or have any idea how does that compare in recurrence to other frameworks.
