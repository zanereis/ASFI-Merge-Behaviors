Thanks for your comments. Please correct me if I am wrong, because I have very limited knowledge in javascript. It seems we can create objects dynamically using syntax of `_.{set,get}`? This is really cool! Can we easily enumerate & sort all fields of an object in the view templates?\n\nCurrently, it seems sorting over lists works naturally well. I didn't write any code for sorting the notebooks, but the folders will appear on top if it starts with \"/\".
