there been any progress on this request?  I have tried to find the \"recommended\" approach for data level security but not sure if anything has been published. For instance, we use Druid+Superset and there are some requests for multi-tenant id but unsure if this works as expected.  I would think having a user level permission on a specific data source is a requirement for most organizations.  Also, on FilterBoxes, allowing a user to select specific dimension values based on Role/Group would be preferable.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, how have others worked around this?  Is using a Slice or Datasource per user really feasible? How does the networking work? Proxy? Kubernetes INGRES?  \r\n\r\nAny thoughts on this are appreciated. While we use Superset internally, we cannot expand to a broader user base without this functionality.

I'd say that one of the guidelines for creating new chart type as opposed to overloading an existing one is around the % of shared/relevant controls.\r\n\r\nWe currently don't have support for conditional form controls, meaning that selecting certain option in one control would affect the existence of other controls or control-sections. Until we have this I think it should be 2 different chart types. \r\n\r\nI'm more troubled by the `GROUPED BY` vs `NOT GROUPED BY` options. When I added that to the Table viz early on in the project, I never thought it should be replicated to other chart types. The control panel section is bloated/confusing enough as it is without having 2 query-related sections. I think the short term solution here would be to have dropdowns with a mix of columns and metrics where we want to enable that. I think the longer term solution is to have a column-centric approach that allows (but doesn't always require) applying aggregate functions to the column. An example of that is that the `clicks` can be dragged to a `Metrics` section, and becomes `clicks [sum]` by default where an aggregation is required. You can then change it to other aggregations like `clicks [avg]` using a contextual popover. If the context doesn't require the column to be aggregated than it would allow turning off aggregations.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/363314952/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/363315768","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/4342#issuecomment-363315768","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/4342","id":363315768,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MzMxNTc2OA==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-06T05:32:54Z","updated_at":"2018-02-06T05:32:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Yes.
