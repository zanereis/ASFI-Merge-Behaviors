It is problem when we were integrating Parquet 1.12 with Iceberg internally, specifically, Parquet Modular encryption(PME) uses the runtime libs of `org.codehaus.jackson`.

But the community is trying to use Parquet 1.12 to enable PME. So I suggest to fix it in master, and leave 0.11.x alone. We probably won't enable PME in 0.11.x.\r\n\r\nBesides, even without Parquet 1.12 integration, this shading is unnecessary since it shades a non-exist package `org.apache.parquet.shaded.org.codehaus.jackson`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/821920661/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/821921177","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2479#issuecomment-821921177","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2479","id":821921177,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyMTkyMTE3Nw==","user":{"login":"flyrain","id":1322359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjIzNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1322359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyrain","html_url":"https://github.com/flyrain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyrain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyrain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyrain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyrain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyrain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyrain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyrain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyrain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyrain/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-18T02:47:35Z","updated_at":"2021-04-18T02:47:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"BTW, we didn't notice any Avro issue.

According to the current design draft in the community, Iceberg will use a part of PME in Parquet-1.12 - the part that implements the spec, and doesn't need the codehaus jackson (or any other json lib). The other part, that implements a Parquet version of key management, will not be used, because Iceberg will have project-wide modules with encryption API and key management that work the same for Parquet, ORC, Avro data files and for all metadata files. Only these modules will need a json lib; Iceberg will be free from PME key manager dependency on codehaus jackson.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/821940635/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/821958434","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2272#issuecomment-821958434","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2272","id":821958434,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyMTk1ODQzNA==","user":{"login":"XuQianJin-Stars","id":10494131,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDk0MTMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10494131?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars","html_url":"https://github.com/XuQianJin-Stars","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-18T09:02:34Z","updated_at":"2021-04-18T09:02:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Hi @XuQianJin-Stars - is there anything pending in this PR.

Regarding handling NaN in min/max, I think you are right that they seem fine today if they are created by iceberg library: \r\n- `compare(NaN, xxx) = 1`; `compare(xxx, NaN) = -1`\r\n- when we [create them before handling NaN](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/469f6c3f640293df6c629a693450736350aa6fab/core/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/PartitionSummary.java#L88-L92), if input is NaN, min will never be NaN but max will always be NaN\r\n- In [`ManifestFileUtil`](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/469f6c3f640293df6c629a693450736350aa6fab/core/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/util/ManifestFileUtil.java#L72-L76) now, input as NaN should be intercepted before reaching these comparison evaluation, and we can ignore comparison with lower bound since it won't be NaN. When comparison with upper bound, `comparator.compare(typedValue, NaN) > 0`  will always be false and thus the method `canContain` will reach true. \r\n\r\nHowever I guess this is when it's guaranteed that the summary is generated by iceberg library. Since direct comparison with NaN will also be false (e.g. `3D > Double.NaN` -> false, `Double.NaN > 3D` -> false), I think if there are custom implementations for this summary info that uses this approach, the assumption that `lowerBound` will not be `NaN` may not hold. and in this case `compare(xxx, lowerBound) < 0` will lead to true which lets the `canContain` return false which may not be correct. In this case I think it might be safer if we add a logic to explicitly check for `lowerbound` for NaN value. What do you think?
