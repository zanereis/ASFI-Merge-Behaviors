In general GPL and Apache Foundation are a bad match, so if there is another license available, that is most probably the correct one. GPLv2 with class path exception might be workable, but apache legal is reluctant. So let's stay away. If a project is dual-licenses under a variant of GPL and CDDL, then choose CDDL, as that license is at least accepted inside the ASF.\r\n\r\nFor the metro library - I think using one released version is the right approach. I also verified, that for 2.1b16 no javadocs are present on maven central (at least my search-fu was not good enough to find them). But then we have the documentation for 1.4 and the binaries for 2.1.... (not directed at you, just thinking out loud). So you binaries-list looks sensible.\r\n\r\nThe alternative: Go directly to a recent version of metro 2.3.1 - I think I saw the javadocs for \"-rt\" on maven central.

way.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/417069035/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/417163371","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/817#issuecomment-417163371","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/817","id":417163371,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNzE2MzM3MQ==","user":{"login":"junichi11","id":738383,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczODM4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/738383?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11","html_url":"https://github.com/junichi11","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-30T01:52:39Z","updated_at":"2018-08-30T01:52:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Response

In the beginning of the transition phase the Downloader task was modified to recognize the pattern `group:name:version:classifier@extension` (classifier + extension are optional). If the pattern is found, the file is downloaded from maven central. See for example `libs.amazon/external/binaries-list`.\r\n\r\nThe external files are referenced from the containing project in different ways, as the file name will probably change, references need to be updated. Check `project.properties`. The properties, that begin with `release.` specify filemapping from the module into the release. So:\r\n\r\n`release.external/glassfish-logging-2.0.jar=modules/ext/glassfish-logging-2.0.jar`\r\n\r\nmeans, that the file `external/glassfish-logging-2.0.jar` (left-hand) will end up in `<cluster>/modules/ext/glassfish-logging-2.0.jar` (right-hand).\r\n\r\nYou will also want to look in `project.xml`. The file you are changing might be referenced and in this case it is so:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n            <class-path-extension>\r\n                <runtime-relative-path>ext/glassfish-logging-2.0.jar</runtime-relative-path>\r\n                <binary-origin>external/glassfish-logging-2.0.jar</binary-origin>\r\n            </class-path-extension>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think you are able to deduce where the paths come from (hint: match them to the `project.properties`).\r\n\r\nIf other code refers to files, this potentially needs to be adjusted - that needs decisions case-by-case. Grep is your fried :-)\r\n\r\nHope that helps a bit.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/417953415/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/417970860","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/830#issuecomment-417970860","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/830","id":417970860,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNzk3MDg2MA==","user":{"login":"junichi11","id":738383,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczODM4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/738383?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11","html_url":"https://github.com/junichi11","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-03T00:24:10Z","updated_at":"2018-09-03T00:24:10Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Regarding
