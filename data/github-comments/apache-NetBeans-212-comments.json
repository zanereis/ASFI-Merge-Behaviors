This is the layout I use in my IDE:\r\n\r\n![Breakpoints & evaluate expression views](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/assets/1842422/c2a76848-a3e0-4ffa-bade-f83019a966bb)\r\n\r\nI can modify the PR to reposition \"Evaluate Expression\" window as well, if there is a consensus where to put it. The current location (below editor and above output) is needlessly wide and takes away precious space of editor or variables view.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2179742569/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2180230653","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/7480#issuecomment-2180230653","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/7480","id":2180230653,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6B8639","user":{"login":"eirikbakke","id":886243,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NjI0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/886243?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke","html_url":"https://github.com/eirikbakke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-20T09:28:06Z","updated_at":"2024-06-20T09:28:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for reviewing!

reading of the `BeanModelBuilder` is, that properties are reported when:\r\n\r\n- there is a setter\r\n- there is a list/map getter\r\n- there is a getter with a corresponding `@NamedArg` parameter in the constructor with the most parameters\r\n\r\nFor KeyCodeCombination there are no getters for the individual keys and thus the third option does not match.\r\n\r\nIf I understand this correctly: https://github.com/openjdk/jfx/blob/6a586b662592be3eb81670f0c5ce48061c2fc07c/modules/javafx.fxml/src/main/java/com/sun/javafx/fxml/builder/ProxyBuilder.java#L248\r\n\r\n- JFX prefers to use an exactly matching constructor for the supplied parameters\r\n- if there is a default constructor and all supplied property values are covered by setters, this combination is used\r\n- else try to find a suitable constructor/setters combination to cover all parameters\r\n\r\nI think the model needs to be updated to report the constructor parameters as a separate list and the use sited of the property need to take this into account.\r\n\r\nThe code for scanning the constructors with `NamedArg`s:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/netbeans/blob/02c66120a8d5c90cde4c706bb15e7121372fd513/javafx/javafx2.editor/src/org/netbeans/modules/javafx2/editor/completion/beans/BeanModelBuilder.java#L336-L357\r\n\r\nlooks like a good starting point. The name extraction is demonstrated there. The code in `registerProperty` for normal setter can be a template for extracting the type information.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/netbeans/blob/02c66120a8d5c90cde4c706bb15e7121372fd513/javafx/javafx2.editor/src/org/netbeans/modules/javafx2/editor/completion/beans/BeanModelBuilder.java#L580-L586\r\n\r\n@sijskes will you look into this?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2185259133/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2185261273","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/7503#issuecomment-2185261273","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/7503","id":2185261273,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6CQHDZ","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-23T18:22:18Z","updated_at":"2024-06-23T18:22:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Tested NB22 on Ubuntu Linux with OpenJDK 21 - not reproducible there.
