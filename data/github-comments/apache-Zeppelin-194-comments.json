That means when user create new note, they can specify the default paragraph configuration in this note. And this kind of default configuration will be passed to Paragraph when it is created.

Double-clicking will display the code editing area.\r\nSimilarly, in some interpreters such as SubmarineInterpreters, the title bar is displayed by default, which is convenient for the user to enter the algorithm module name.\r\nWhen the user selects the Submarine interpreter for use, each paragraph will display the title bar by default as a clear behavior, which will not cause confusion for the user.\r\n\r\nIf the configuration does not take effect when the paragraph is created, the user must execute the code for this paragraph, passing through the interpreter process.\r\n```\r\npublic InterpreterResult interpret(String script, InterpreterContext context) {\r\n    context.getConfig().put(\"title\", true);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nChanges the configuration of the front-end paragraph. It is technically feasible, but such an interpreter already explicitly needs to display the title, but it is not displayed by default, which makes the user inconvenient to use and prone to confusion.\r\n\r\nAnd now the configuration of the paragraph has been supported for dynamic modification. Dynamically modifying the interpreter in different paragraphs in the same note will re-enable the paragraph configuration according to the configuration of the corresponding interpreter. To some extent, make up for your concerns.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/457430662/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/457477209","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/3290#issuecomment-457477209","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/3290","id":457477209,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NzQ3NzIwOQ==","user":{"login":"felixcheung","id":8969467,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5Njk0Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8969467?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung","html_url":"https://github.com/felixcheung","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-25T07:09:04Z","updated_at":"2019-01-25T07:09:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"hmm, yes, do build and test run correctly?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/457477209/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/457492570","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/3290#issuecomment-457492570","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/3290","id":457492570,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NzQ5MjU3MA==","user":{"login":"maziyarpanahi","id":5762953,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NjI5NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5762953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maziyarpanahi","html_url":"https://github.com/maziyarpanahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maziyarpanahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maziyarpanahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maziyarpanahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maziyarpanahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maziyarpanahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maziyarpanahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maziyarpanahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maziyarpanahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maziyarpanahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-25T08:21:11Z","updated_at":"2019-01-25T08:21:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you very much @zjffdu, this is a big help!

let me know if the tests are OK so I can also add them to the master with another pull request.\r\n\r\nAgain, many thanks for your help. \r\nI really appreciate

Progress bar is very important in machine learning libraries, specially for deep learning libraries, such as tensorflow, keras. Is it possible to keep the progress bar behavior ?  You can use the following code snippet to test the progress bar. \r\n\r\n```\r\nimport time,sys\r\nend_val = 10\r\nbar_length = 20\r\nfor i in xrange(0, end_val + 1):\r\n    time.sleep(0.5)\r\n    percent = float(i) / end_val\r\n    hashes = '#' * int(round(percent * bar_length))\r\n    spaces = ' ' * (bar_length - len(hashes))\r\n    sys.stdout.write(\"\\rPercent: [{0}] {1}%\".format(hashes + spaces, int(round(percent * 100))))\r\n    #print \"Percent: [{0}] {1}%\".format(hashes + spaces, int(round(percent * 100)))\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/462212340/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/462507460","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/3302#issuecomment-462507460","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/3302","id":462507460,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MjUwNzQ2MA==","user":{"login":"Leemoonsoo","id":1540981,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDA5ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1540981?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo","html_url":"https://github.com/Leemoonsoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-11T21:46:24Z","updated_at":"2019-02-11T21:46:24Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for explaining.
