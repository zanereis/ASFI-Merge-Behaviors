By using `wait_ultil` and try every 2s for max of 15s, we get the old behaviour of having to wait 15s in case the interface is not there.

I see three distinct pieces:\n1. **Spring 4 Upgrade**:  Spring 4 supports both Java7 and Java8.  Therefore, this upgrade can be done without involving Java8.\n2. **Jetty Embedding**:  Again, Jetty 9 supports both Java7 and Java8.  Therefore, this work can be done without involving Java8.\n3. **Java8**: Ideally, this piece should be fairly small -- disabling the F5 plugin, changing the POMs, and a sundry of minor code changes to achieve compilation.\n\nThe harder part is that all of these changes will require a full end-to-end test of the system.\n\nFinally, for Java8, I suggest that we follow the convention of many of Java-based projects and remove the package dependencies on the JDK.  Some users choose to use OpenJDK and others choose Oracle's JDK.  Therefore, the current dependency makes an invalid assumption about the JDK users want to use -- making it more difficult to use the implementation of their choice.\n\n@wido as @rhtyd points out, Java8 is available via PPAs.  IMHO, Ubuntu's decision to keep their distribution out-of-date is not a sufficient reason to continue requiring the use of an unsupported Java runtime.  Given the number of significant security issues that have been discovered in the JRE over the past few years, the longer we wait to upgrade to Java8, the greater the risk that a significant security issue arises that forces CloudStack users to either turn off their instances or run and hope no one hacks them.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/219047291/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/219049934","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1521#issuecomment-219049934","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1521","id":219049934,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxOTA0OTkzNA==","user":{"login":"DaanHoogland","id":2486961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODY5NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2486961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland","html_url":"https://github.com/DaanHoogland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-13T13:56:30Z","updated_at":"2016-05-13T13:56:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rhtyd @jburwell @wido @swill Are we not doing this?

I only use Vmware hypervisor so I couldn't test it for Xen or KVM. However, I reviewed code and found `copySnapshotToTemplateFromNfsToNfsXenserver` method in `NfsSecondaryStorageResource` which will attemp mount using nfs version. I'm not very familiar to Xen code in CloudStack but if it uses NfsSecondaryStorage for mounting I think I can succeed, but it should be tested or improved to support those hypervisors\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/219083470/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/219083712","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1503#issuecomment-219083712","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1503","id":219083712,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxOTA4MzcxMg==","user":{"login":"swill","id":13644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill","html_url":"https://github.com/swill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-13T15:52:31Z","updated_at":"2016-05-13T15:52:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I have never seen these test failures before, so I believe they are somehow related to this change.  @olivierlemasle can you review the CI results and post your feedback.
