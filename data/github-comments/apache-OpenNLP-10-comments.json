Curiosity for the win! Maybe @jzonthemtn can comment on that. Both of you are English native speakers, so I think you can better judge whether to split apart those fragments or if they should be kept tied as a result of tokenization.\n\nFor this finding, and after comments by Jeff, one should open a separate Jira, if this is a \"topic\" to work on. The tests could be kept and provide a starting point continue work, that is by leaving a comment with the new issue's identifier (OPENNLP-xyz).

I opened your branch on IntelliJ, then made the jmh profile active by default (how do you tell IntelliJ to include the deps of a profile? anywho), invalidated cache, etc..\r\n\r\nExecuted the tests just to make sure they were running, as you already provided the results. Then executed with the profiler, to generate the `.jfr` file. Saved the `jmh` source folder, checked out `main`, then patched the `pom.xml` files, and executed the same test again, to get another `.jfr` for the `main` branch (so earlier file is for this branch, older is for main).\r\n\r\nOpened both in IntelliJ and selected the `.jfr` file from this branch to compare with the one from `main`.
