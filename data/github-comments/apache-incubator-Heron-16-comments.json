I found the following problems:\n1. In BUILD file: `\"help.py\",` should be `\"cli_helper.py\"` on line 12\n2. In `main.py`: `import heron.cli.src.python.help as cli_help` should be `import heron.cli.src.python.cli_helper as cli_helper` on line 26, and change the following occurrence of `cli_help` to `cli_helper`.\n3. In `main.py`: `cli_help.create_parser(subparsers)` only provides one argument while the method in `cli_helper.py` requires 3 parameters: `def create_parser(subparsers, action, help):`. I think we should either remove this line, or find the proper arguments for it. \n4. In `submit.py`: `javaDefines=cl_args['topology_main_jvm_property'])` on line 175 should be `java_defines=cl_args['topology_main_jvm_property'])`\n5. In `submit.py`: `javaDefines=[]` on line 106 should be `java_defines=[]`\n\nAfter that, I can launch launch a topology successfully. But there might be other problems.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/225029770/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/225033699","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/849#issuecomment-225033699","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/849","id":225033699,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNTAzMzY5OQ==","user":{"login":"nlu90","id":16407807,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDA3ODA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16407807?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlu90","html_url":"https://github.com/nlu90","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlu90/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlu90/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlu90/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlu90/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlu90/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlu90/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlu90/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlu90/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlu90/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-09T21:34:03Z","updated_at":"2016-06-09T21:41:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I tried with other heron operations and  found following problems: \n\n`kill` is not invoked correctly.\n\n``` bash\n[tw-mbp-nlu heron (alan/pylint-rcfile)]$ heron kill local nlu-ex\nINFO: heron_class 10\nINFO: heron_class 20\n[2016-06-09 14:23:44 -0700] com.twitter.heron.spi.utils.TMasterUtils SEVERE:  Topology is already activateed  \nINFO: Successfully activate topology 'nlu-ex'\nINFO: Elapsed time: 2.971s.\n```\n\n`deactivate` is not invoked correctly.\n\n``` bash\n[tw-mbp-nlu heron (alan/pylint-rcfile)]$ heron deactivate local nlu-ex\nINFO: heron_class 10\nINFO: heron_class 20\n[2016-06-09 14:27:26 -0700] com.twitter.heron.spi.utils.TMasterUtils SEVERE:  Topology is already activateed  \nINFO: Successfully activate topology 'nlu-ex'\nINFO: Elapsed time: 2.935s.\n```\n\nThey are all bind to `activate` instead.

First, yes, Tmaster should be definitely started as a job on a Mesos slave, like the other Heron containers. That way it would be simply supervised with the Heron Mesos scheduler. Second is a bit trickier and involves slight changes to Heron‚Äôs SubmitterMain, so would be nice to hear your thoughts on this. Currently Heron is not allowing to ‚Äúpick up‚Äù the failed topology with the same `heron submit` command obviously. Like, if we would put the `heron submit` under the Mesos supervision as is, SubmitterMain will yell at us at this point: https://github.com/twitter/heron/blob/master/heron/scheduler-core/src/java/com/twitter/heron/scheduler/SubmitterMain.java#L440. What would be nice to do here is the following. Let's say, Heron would acknowledge through state manager that there is a Scheduler registered for the topology, and the topology is found in a running state. So if when it pings the scheduler‚Äôs address and it responds as being unreachable, it still launches the topology through the specified Launcher, but it also passes some config parameter to let know the Launcher that it should do a recover, and not start everything from scratch. Generally speaking, this solution will allow, should one want to start the scheduler under supervision, to set `heron submit` under any high level Mesos scheduler and get a failover tolerant design.\nAlso, sure, the submitting machine should have Mesos master and Zookeeper reachable. Mesos slaves are not required to be able to reach the Heron Mesos scheduler back, however commands like  `heron kill` should be performed from the machines that can reach it. The mentioned updates hopefully to ship soon.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/225616356/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/225641380","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/903#issuecomment-225641380","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/903","id":225641380,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNTY0MTM4MA==","user":{"login":"billonahill","id":23758,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNzU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23758?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill","html_url":"https://github.com/billonahill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-13T16:53:40Z","updated_at":"2016-06-13T16:53:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Can

The change should usually be reflected immediately, although rebooting might be necessary depending on your platform.\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/225721679/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/225727549","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/issues/799#issuecomment-225727549","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/799","id":225727549,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNTcyNzU0OQ==","user":{"login":"billonahill","id":23758,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNzU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23758?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill","html_url":"https://github.com/billonahill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-13T22:27:05Z","updated_at":"2016-06-13T22:27:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closing this for now since travis ci max time has been extended and the bulk of the time spent seems to be the compile.
