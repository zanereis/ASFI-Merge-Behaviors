I'm planning to add some others down on the road, I just would like it to be visible from the start, to be able to talk this through as a process not just one big change.\r\n@JaroslavTulach Unfortunately my direction is not that far reaching. Having general project with natures seems to be a compelling idea, though that would be a big step to jump. I'm not sure if I can make that jump happen. Though if anyone could deliver that, I would happily ditch this set of patches in favor of that. So I'm not trying to reaching that high.\r\nSo my plan is to try something built on the current ProjectFactory2 and ProjectManager.Result. My steps would be:\r\n1. Enhance the PM API to be able to query/load Project \"natures\" recongnized by the IDE.\r\n1. Improve the isProject2 usage to actually return project type\r\n1. Add an Open Project As action if more than one project \"nature\" is detected on a folder.\r\n1. Fix: There could be some glitches around re-opening the projects.\r\n1. Probably add more UI entry for the project \"nature\" selection\r\n\r\nI have something half working on 3., but need to do some real work on 2.

Doing find and replace on the file as it's copied across in the build seems the right approach here?

I think this is a good question.\n\nThis project is maintaining editor features that support developing in the Java language (and we could ask why, although that is probably out of the scope of this PR). So adding a fairly small layer that exports a subset of these features through the LSP does not feel to be very off. It is simply providing a way for those that prefer a different UI to use Java editor features this project already has. Not that this PR would be quite there.\n\nThe NB Java editor has an ability to use JDK's javac for parsing, so it can in some cases support editing of files with Java language features that are newer than the editor itself. And if a new NB feature is added supporting such a new language feature, the LSP server may use it right away. Yes, other server will get that as well, but as long as we maintain the stuff here,  why not allow access to it using the LSP as well?
