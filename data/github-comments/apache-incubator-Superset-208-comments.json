The main things I had questions around are:\r\n\r\n* are there any events I could hook onto when controls are changing? for now I had to hook up something to the `onSaveMap` event. Superset assumes that the visualization controls are outside the visualization, but passes a method to the visualization to allow it to change the value of a superset control. For now what I do is dump the state of Kepler inside a Superset TextControl, but we had to tell the users to go and push that button prior to saving... I wish I have a generic `onKeplerStateChange` prop or something like that...\r\n* is there a light style mode as opposed to the dark theme? I dug through the Kepler code and found some reference to a light theme, but it seemed to apply only to some modals... Maybe we just need a dark mode for Superset :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/481485586/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/481487343","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/7258#issuecomment-481487343","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/7258","id":481487343,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MTQ4NzM0Mw==","user":{"login":"graceguo-supercat","id":27990562,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3OTkwNTYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27990562?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat","html_url":"https://github.com/graceguo-supercat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-10T00:21:51Z","updated_at":"2019-04-10T00:21:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"thanks! i will test in local environment right after merge.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/481487343/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/481491541","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/7260#issuecomment-481491541","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/7260","id":481491541,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MTQ5MTU0MQ==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-10T00:48:01Z","updated_at":"2019-04-10T00:48:10Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7260?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#7260](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7260?src=pr&el=desc) into [lyftga](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/commit/078a9774ce43238e8d46050f1e6cca6399a58aac?src=pr&el=desc) will **not change** coverage.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7260/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&token=KsB0fHcx6l&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7260?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@          Coverage Diff           @@\n##           lyftga   #7260   +/-   ##\n======================================\n  Coverage    64.6%   64.6%           \n======================================\n  Files         425     425           \n  Lines       20891   20891           \n  Branches     2296    2296           \n======================================\n  Hits        13496   13496           \n  Misses       7269    7269           \n  Partials      126     126\n```\n\n\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7260?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7260?src=pr&el=footer).
