If I'd noticed how #1612 was working at the time I'd have -1'd it - I'm still of the opinion it probably needs to be reverted for 12.0, and we live with < 11.2 behaviour.  There are multiple causes of issue 2439, including moving from JDK 8 which this doesn't solve, and network / download problems, which this has made far worse.  Feature on demand activation doesn't handle network problems gracefully at all, and there are various reports of download issues with these modules for all sorts of reasons (network errors, firewalls, etc.)\r\n\r\nTry this, roughly as discussed on dev@ - \r\n\r\n- Switch off your network connection\r\n- Make sure you have lots of Java projects open in 11.3 (fairly normal)\r\n- Open 12.0-beta4 with a clean userdir and click `Yes` to import settings.\r\n- Figure out how to get out of it! :smile:\r\n\r\nPrior to 11.3 people had a broken wizard in this scenario, they now have a broken IDE (well, it's fixable if you really know how).
