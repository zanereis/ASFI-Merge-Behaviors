for `hashCode()`, `equals()` and `toString()` abstract. But also for introducing `canEqual` as proposed by Martin Odersky (https://www.artima.com/lejava/articles/equality.html). The reason is that we currently have the odd behaviour that the `equals` method of `TypleTypeInfo` and `TupleTypeInfoBase` is not an equality relation (reflexive, symmetric, transitive, consistent). The following code demonstrates this:\n\n```\nTupleTypeInfo<Tuple1<Integer>> tupleTypeInfo = new TupleTypeInfo<>(BasicTypeInfo.INT_TYPE_INFO);\n\nTupleTypeInfoBase<Tuple1> anonymousTupleTypeInfo = new TupleTypeInfoBase<Tuple1>((Class<Tuple1>)Tuple1.class, (TypeInformation<?>)BasicTypeInfo.INT_TYPE_INFO) {\n\n    @Override\n    public TypeSerializer<Tuple1> createSerializer(ExecutionConfig config) {\n        return null;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected void initializeNewComparator(int localKeyCount) {}\n\n    @Override\n    protected void addCompareField(int fieldId, TypeComparator<?> comparator) {}\n\n    @Override\n    protected TypeComparator<Tuple1> getNewComparator(ExecutionConfig config) {\n        return null;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String[] getFieldNames() {\n        return new String[0];\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public int getFieldIndex(String fieldName) {\n        return 0;\n    }\n};\n\nSystem.out.println(tupleTypeInfo.equals(anonymousTupleTypeInfo)); // false\nSystem.out.println(anonymousTupleTypeInfo.equals(tupleTypeInfo)); // true\n```\n\nThus, the symmetric condition is violated.\n\nThis should actually be the norm for all future equality implementation, IMHO.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/138519198/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/138521208","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1101#issuecomment-138521208","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1101","id":138521208,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzODUyMTIwOA==","user":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-08T11:16:41Z","updated_at":"2015-09-08T11:16:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The `StreamGraph.addOperator` method takes a `StreamOperator` object as input.

a lot for opening the pull request.\nCan you change the behavior of this a little bit to make the `-n` argument a required argument again? (if the config param is not set)\nI think this behavior is the best:\nif `yarn.numberOfTaskManagers` == -1 (default value): users have to supply the `-n` argument.\nIf `yarn.numberOfTaskManagers` is set to `>= 1`, the value will be used by default.\nIf `yarn.numberOfTaskManagers` is set to `>= 1` and the user specified `-n`, the value of `-n` will have priority.\n\nCan you rename the configuration value to `yarn.defaultNumberOfTaskManagers`?\n\nCan you add a test into the `flink-yarn-tests` which is using a configuration file with `yarn.defaultNumberOfTaskManagers` set to `1` WITHOUT a `-n` argument to see if everything is working as expected?\n\nOne more thing: According to our rules (http://flink.apache.org/coding-guidelines.html), commit messages need to have some description what they are fixing. Can you rename the commit to: \"[FLINK-2591]Add configuration parameter for default number of yarn containers\" ?\nYou don't need to open a new PR to update this one.

ported this pull request to the latest master. It was a lot more work than I anticipated because some classes had diverged significantly and merging them was a bit hard.\n\nDue to some refactoring, the changes have grown quite large again and I know that makes reviewing hard. Despite that, I wouldn't delay merging this pull request much further. We can disable the session management until it is integrated with the rest of the system (intermediate results) by throwing an exception on the interface methods. If we decide later, that we want to delay this feature, we could also remove the session code. In that case, it would still make sense to merge this pull request because it contains a lot of nice refactoring.\n\nWith the session management in place, we can reuse already computed intermediate results with not too much effort. Actually, only some API changes are remaining to expose the session management to the user in production.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/138625172/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/138631715","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1058#issuecomment-138631715","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1058","id":138631715,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzODYzMTcxNQ==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-08T16:52:55Z","updated_at":"2015-09-08T16:52:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Is anything happening here, or can we close this?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/138631715/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/138636557","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1093#issuecomment-138636557","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1093","id":138636557,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzODYzNjU1Nw==","user":{"login":"hsaputra","id":105434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTQzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/105434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra","html_url":"https://github.com/hsaputra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-08T17:08:46Z","updated_at":"2015-09-08T17:08:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I agree to keep on-heap memory management as default.

In fact, persisting data sets was one of the main motivations to redesign and the network stack as implemented by @uce. By doing it on the network stack level, persisted data sets can also be used for failure recovery and used across different jobs within a session. \n\nThis PR is basically ignoring the previous

If the Memory manager is alive, the results will be there for any job to use. \nFor a true across-job sharing, one possible feature would be to add a method for initialization from the environment as `getPersistedSource(String)` which would access results from a persisted data set from some entirely independent job.\n\nFurther, this kind of makes sense on an operator level. User should have to ability to explicitly persist a data set in memory, which calls for providing a function call. I was only drawing the analogy from spark's api. I have no idea how they internally implement this, but if an API function is to be provided, it can only be done in two ways. Either return a new Operator, as a transformation on the original data set, or just by returning the same data set [like `withBroadcastSet` does]. The former seemed easier to work with, because it doesn't interfere with the existing mechanisms.\n\nI have implemented no new internal functionality, but only used the existing system. I would've loved more discussion on this but frankly, once I started going through the internal mechanisms, it seemed like a pretty trivial thing to implement. Of course that was when I wasn't aware it was intended to be used for recovery.\nIf there is some work on persisting intermediate results for recovery, the same mechanism can be used for a persist operation, in which case this work is anyways moot. But there has to be an API call to allow users to explicitly cache results in memory.

However, this feature can be implemented in different ways, for example using the network stack or on the operator level. Even if one implementation looks straight-forward, it can have severe limitations and implications on the behavior of the system. That is why such features should be discussed before taking action even if it looks like an easily doable thing.\n\nDoing it on an operator level has several shortcomings:\n- persisted data sets cannot be used for recovery. If done on the network stack level, the same code can be basically used for both.\n- data cannot (easily) be shared across jobs. Operators are expected to return their memory when a job is done otherwise this will be a memory leak. There is no way to free memory if the job is finished and did not do it.\n\n@uce, @StephanEwen You are more familiar with this feature.

It violates so many assumptions, like the fact that memory is available after a job ends. The accounting for that depends on task slots - a free slot must have the necessary memory.\n\nWhen you call collect twice, the whole program get re-executed and some parts are simply discarded for the sake of using the persisted data. That makes sure the results are the same, but does not safe any work. For that, you need backtracking through the graph to check whether results are already available.\n\nWhich brings us to the point:\n\nMaking the system's level of data streams aware of this (both on TaskManager and JobManager side) solves two issues with one approach: Caching for reuse in incrementally constructed programs, and caching for recovery. Both cases simply need persistent streams and backtracking in the execution graph.\n\nSorry that you made this effort and it cannot be merged now, but I do not understand why you keep ignoring the discussions, inputs, and the request to plan and describe such highly involved features before writing them.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/138861709/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/138862613","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1103#issuecomment-138862613","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1103","id":138862613,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzODg2MjYxMw==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-09T10:05:59Z","updated_at":"2015-09-09T10:05:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Okay, let me merge your code and try to fix this test on the way...\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/138862613/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/138863134","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/605#issuecomment-138863134","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/605","id":138863134,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzODg2MzEzNA==","user":{"login":"mxm","id":837221,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNzIyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/837221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm","html_url":"https://github.com/mxm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-09T10:09:08Z","updated_at":"2015-09-09T10:09:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @tammymendt. Thanks for the pull request! The accumulators work a little bit different now because they are now accumulated on a per-task basis and reported to the job manager in regular intervals.\n\nThe `clone()` method in `OperatorStatistics` doesn't create a deep copy of the object, i.e. some references are reused. That causes problems when merging the accumulators because runtime accumulators are modified while merging accumulators for sending them to the job manager.\n\nI could make the test pass by a nasty deep copy using Java serialization. However, I didn't managed to make a proper copy using the provided interfaces.
