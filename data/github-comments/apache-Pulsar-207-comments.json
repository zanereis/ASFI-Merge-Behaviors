So, the first time it fails like this and then it will work until the topic is deleted, which will happen automatically after a while with default broker settings.\r\n\r\nI think it would be a good idea to cherry-pick this fix to 2.5.1 since it makes it look like the broker is broken when the user requests a heartbeat in Pulsar Manager. This is also a regression compared to 2.5.0 which doesn't have this

I assumed that it was related to this issue, but it is not. \r\n\r\nI just built new Docker images with this fix (v2.5.1-candidate-2 + 6683), and it doesn't resolve that issue. So, there is a different issue here. I will test with master to see if the health check works there.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/611981102/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/611981927","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/6701#issuecomment-611981927","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/6701","id":611981927,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxMTk4MTkyNw==","user":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-10T10:51:10Z","updated_at":"2020-04-10T10:51:10Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@itaross it seems like a bug.

Do you want to contribute a fix?\r\n\r\nI am not quite sure it is a bug from Pulsar side.\r\nThe Pulsar API expects to find \"pulsar-io.yaml\" inside the .nar archive, but when building it is not copied under target/classes/META-INF/services.\r\nFrom Ni-Fi plugin side I understand that they could not be aware that it is required to copy that pulsar-io.yaml. Yesterday I digged down a bit and I have found that on apache/nifi-maven there is this method: \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/nifi-maven/blob/b81db233a200847998a57ac9b1f5b6218ab66a1b/src/main/java/org/apache/nifi/extension/definition/extraction/ExtensionDefinitionFactory.java#L104\r\nI am not quite sure if it is referred to the target folder or resources under src.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the use of that maven goal resources:resources I came up with overcomes the missing file in the target directory.\r\nSo a correct maven pipeline is:\r\n```\r\nmvn clean compile resources:resources nifi-nar:nar\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't know if this is really a bug or not, if you can suggest one I can try to fix it.\r\nFor now I think the first action is to update the documentation with the use of this resources plugin for maven.\r\n\r\nPS. I wonder how people wrote connectors until now.
