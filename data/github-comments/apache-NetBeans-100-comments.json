One is comment support while hitting enter to add a new '*' and also the other thing to add at the end of the comment. And adding code generators for getter/setter in TypeScript.\r\n\r\nSo next time, please create one ticket for each feature. Code generator for getter and setter has nothing todo with the comments that you requested.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I had a look into the code generation stuff and found this tutorial: https://netbeans.apache.org/tutorials/nbm-code-generator.html The problem with this tutorial is, that is is very coupled to the JavaSource class which can handle all the stuff inside a Java file to identify what is a member, what is a class, what is an interface etc. Such feature, afaik is not available for JavaScript nor TypeScript. TypeScript was the first language which was implemented with the textmate lexer and I dunno whether we already have a class where we can figure out what is a variable, class, (A parser) etc. I think also this comes from the Language Server of TypeScript, if we can get the info from the server, that could be easier to handle. There is a PHP implementation somehow but someone created an ASTNode and all other stuff directly for PHP. I jumped into this too to check what they did for PHP and maybe we can use it but I dunno. There is a global parser but the rest needs to be handled differently. I can have a look when NetBeans starts to build again.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative, we can use a 3rd-party-lib called tree-sitter and the java impl by JetBrains: https://github.com/JetBrains/jsitter. To parse a language, which is supported by this parser: http://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/. So differnet approach as ANTLR or JavaCC because you don't need to create a lexer before, I mean someone already did this but we don't need to do this by our own. So it creates a concrete syntax tree for this language. That means for all the supported languages of this parser we can try to use this and make this by our own.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1023417592/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1023433341","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/3506#issuecomment-1023433341","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/3506","id":1023433341,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M49AFp9","user":{"login":"mbien","id":114367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien","html_url":"https://github.com/mbien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-27T16:51:13Z","updated_at":"2022-01-27T16:51:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@neilcsmith-net I am pretty sure we don't disagree :) I only tried to clarify that when I mentioned DRY the first time, it already included other aspects like resources in my mind, not just the few lines of UI code which could be saved.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1023433341/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1023436329","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/3506#issuecomment-1023436329","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/3506","id":1023436329,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M49AGYp","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-27T16:54:23Z","updated_at":"2022-01-27T16:54:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@neilcsmith-net squashed the commits I wanted squashed and adjusted the title of the second commit to refer to the JIRA issue.

Maybe its still good enough for the wizzard - I don't know.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1024666762/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1024874397","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/3511#issuecomment-1024874397","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/3511","id":1024874397,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M49Fled","user":{"login":"mbien","id":114367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien","html_url":"https://github.com/mbien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-29T09:21:45Z","updated_at":"2022-01-29T09:21:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"it might be worth investigating if it would make sense to add modifiers to the `ElementHandle` API.\r\n\r\nRemoving good-first-issue label again :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1024874397/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1025558000","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/3540#issuecomment-1025558000","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/3540","id":1025558000,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M49IMXw","user":{"login":"mbien","id":114367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien","html_url":"https://github.com/mbien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-31T09:56:16Z","updated_at":"2022-01-31T09:56:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@JaroslavTulach I do what i can but a lot of this is still black magic to me :)\r\n\r\nI am going to rebase this PR for delivery just in case it can be still integrated.
