Thanks for responding to these questions and adding the documentation and tests. You probably don't want every edge case validation conditional spelled out in the docs, but I think it's worth letting the user know what to expect, e.g. \"Be aware that if you misspell a property, it will be treated as non-existent and the default value of 'X' will be used. You will not get an exception/error.\"\r\n\r\nAs a general soft rule around adding features, they can typically come in these flavors, in quasi-descending order of desirability:\r\n\r\n1. Feature added with full Management UI or Ambari support for enabling/disabling and configuring in single PR. (if it's a huge PR, it may be better to go with option 2)\r\n2. Feature added with UI config support, but split into multiple PRs. Indicate in the description what you're doing and link the PRs to one another in the description. You can request individual review of each PR and say something like \"don't merge until all K PRs in this work have been +1'ed,\" and then commit each PR in sequence. Ideally, the last PR will include all K-1 PRs and will have been tested to ensure the entire unit of work works. See parser chaining as an example. https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1084. I would take this a step further and explicitly add the links to the PRs.\r\n    > Note, this PR depends on METRON-1643 and METRON-1642, so those should be reviewed prior to this.\r\n3. Feature added without UI support. **MUST** have documentation for manual configuration. Create Jiras to track the follow-on work and link them to the original.\r\n4. Feature flags - yet to be formally adopted as an approach in Metron, but there is open discussion on it.\r\n\r\nNot really applicable here, but one other option in situations like this is a feature branch. We typically use that for more disruptive and/or larger changes that we want more flexibility with on the individual commits, but it's worth mentioning. In this case, the gating factor for the individual PRs in the feature branch is a bit lower. You might provide a PR that breaks something temporarily in the FB, for example. Or you save documentation until after you've iterated on the feature enough to be comfortable with the implementation. You indicate what the necessary follow-on work will be arising from the PR against the feature branch, create a sub-task for it on the feature Jira, and it becomes a gating factor for final vote and acceptance on merging the FB into master.\r\n\r\nThis PR fits option 3, which is perfectly fine. We just need a bit of expansion on testing and documentation as we've already touched on.\r\n\r\nApache Metron community standards around automated and manual testing apply the same in all cases, with the exception of feature branches where only the final unit of work is reviewed by that standard. Any committer can veto a PR and the approach taken at any time if they think it will not work well for the product and its users, so ymmv. Communicating the full feature delivery lifecycle (e.g. justifying/explaining the why and how of follow-ons) obviously helps grease the skids on this and increases the likelihood of an expedient review and ultimately a +1.\r\n\r\nOk, enough on dev guidelines for now. I should probably get these thoughts into a discuss thread and our dev guidelines at some point, but it seemed useful here as we discussed the implementation choices.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/498797705/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/499155765","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1417#issuecomment-499155765","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1417","id":499155765,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5OTE1NTc2NQ==","user":{"login":"mmiklavc","id":658443,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODQ0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/658443?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc","html_url":"https://github.com/mmiklavc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-05T16:23:45Z","updated_at":"2019-06-05T16:23:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm +1 as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/499155765/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/499530840","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1431#issuecomment-499530840","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1431","id":499530840,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5OTUzMDg0MA==","user":{"login":"tiborm","id":2437400,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0Mzc0MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2437400?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiborm","html_url":"https://github.com/tiborm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiborm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiborm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiborm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiborm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiborm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiborm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiborm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiborm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiborm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-06T14:57:46Z","updated_at":"2019-06-06T14:57:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mmiklavc @sardell I was extended the validation of context-menu.conf.json and covered all scenarios with unit tests.

There are 2 versions of guava required by different classes (Stellar and HBase testing utility) so we need a way to relocate one of them.  It's not possible to do this without depending on a shaded module because transitive dependencies have already been resolved (meaning only 1 version remains) by the time the final shaded jar is built.  Relocating at this point just relocates the single remaining version.\r\n\r\nAt this point I want to summarize my findings and present some options.  Here are the requirements I see:\r\n\r\n1. Transitive dependency resolution should be predictable and easy to troubleshoot.  Maven configuration settings (excludes, etc) should work as expected.\r\n2. Versions reported by mvn dependency:tree should match what's included in the uber jar.\r\n3. There should be a well understood and robust strategy for relocating classes that conflict.\r\n\r\nUsing classifiers on all modules solves 1 and 2 but does not support 3 as described above.  We currently support 3 but not 1 and 2 because lower level modules (like metron-common) do not use a classifier.  This means other modules that depend on it inherit relocated classes.  The problem is that transitive dependencies from these modules overwrite other dependencies, making it harder to determine which versions end up in the final uber jar.\r\n\r\nTo get to a point where we can satisfy all 3 requirements above, I can think of a couple options.  Both of these options are based on the assumption that most class version conflicts involve Stellar classes.  Stellar contains most of our business logic and contains a long list of dependencies, including several that commonly conflict with other projects (guava, log4j, jackson, etc).  The idea behind both of these options involves isolating Stellar from the rest of the project.  Here they are:\r\n\r\n1. Make Stellar the exception and remove the classifier on stellar-common.  This module would be the only one that does this.  This satisfies 3 as long as code requiring different class versions is located in this module.  This means we may need to move classes into this module (or do this with other modules too).  To satisfy 1 and 2 we would need to ensure we are rewriting ALL transitive dependencies or tolerate relocating classes as we run into issues.  The advantage of this approach is there would still be a single uber jar so changes to scripts and classpath setup would not change.  The disadvantage is there is still the risk of transitive dependencies leaking into the main uber jar.\r\n\r\n2. Deploy Stellar code in a separate jar and add it to classpath after the main uber jar, whatever that is (metron-data-management, metron-enrichment-storm, etc).  This satisfies 3 because the separate Stellar jar can contain the relocated classes but other dependencies will not overwrite dependencies of the main uber jar (because it's listed after the main uber jar).  1 and 2 are not a concern when classifiers are used which is the case here.  The main disadvantage I see is that there will be work adding this extra jar in the various scripts or startup options and we may have to reorganize some classes.\r\n\r\nI tested both options and was able to get both working for the these use cases:\r\n\r\n- Generate a bloom filter and read it back (https://metron.apache.org/current-book/use-cases/typosquat_detection/index.html)\r\n- Enrichment and parser topology regression test\r\n  \r\n This is all fairly complex so if anything is not clear I can elaborate.  Are there other options I'm not thinking of?  Thoughts?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/499591873/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/500073737","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1440#issuecomment-500073737","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1440","id":500073737,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMDA3MzczNw==","user":{"login":"ottobackwards","id":1111551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTE1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards","html_url":"https://github.com/ottobackwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-08T00:01:24Z","updated_at":"2019-06-08T00:01:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This

This manual test is picking a fairly narrow interpretation of all that can be done with JsonPatch, and I'm unclear whether we're introducing a feature regression here or not. I know we're using json patch (separately) for handling Ambari modifications to global config to ensure we don't trample user-added or other type of updates that aren't managed by Ambari. I'm concerned about what's not covered by switching from json patch to our own private version of it, specifically here. Very likely, the existing unit and integration tests are only verifying some basic functionality wrt the jsonpatch library (we are depending on the jsonpatch project to handle the fine grained testing of all the RFC details for us), so if we're going to replace it I think we need to do one of the following:\r\n1. (preferred) Own all of the test scenarios as defined in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902 to ensure we meet the spec and do not introduce any regressions.\r\n2. Modify the documentation, whether in our REST API implementation details for UI devs or in user-facing docs, to be explicit about what patching functionality we are or are not planning to support.\r\n\r\nIf we are walking back functionality by choosing option 2, I think this needs to be accompanied with a proper DISCUSS thread and a feature change notice in the release/upgrading notes. In addition, we would need to:\r\n1. Expand the manual test cases to include any existing features in the UI to ensure we we haven't removed or altered what is expected from RFC 6902\r\n2. Add additional unit and integration tests to cover cases not already handled by the automated testing framework.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/501453074/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/501454083","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1374#issuecomment-501454083","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1374","id":501454083,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMTQ1NDA4Mw==","user":{"login":"mmiklavc","id":658443,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODQ0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/658443?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc","html_url":"https://github.com/mmiklavc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-12T21:02:17Z","updated_at":"2019-06-12T21:02:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks like this also needs conflict resolution.

Attempting a filter on alerts without the field not being set does not hence yield the desired result.\r\n\r\nSo the following filter:\r\n```\r\nalert_status:(NEW OR OPEN)\r\n```\r\nwill not display alerts which have their default status (i.e. `NEW`) set during creation time. However, if one manually set the status of an alert to `NEW` (e.g. switch from `NEW` (default) -> `OPEN` -> `NEW`), then the query works fine. \r\n\r\nI have created

Both of these options are based on the assumption that most class version conflicts involve Stellar classes. Stellar contains most of our business logic and contains a long list of dependencies, including several that commonly conflict with other projects (guava, log4j, jackson, etc). The idea behind both of these options involves isolating Stellar from the rest of the project. Here they are:\r\n> \r\n> 1. Make Stellar the exception and remove the classifier on stellar-common.  This module would be the only one that does this.  This satisfies 3 as long as code requiring different class versions is located in this module.  This means we may need to move classes into this module (or do this with other modules too).  To satisfy 1 and 2 we would need to ensure we are rewriting ALL transitive dependencies or tolerate relocating classes as we run into issues.  The advantage of this approach is there would still be a single uber jar so changes to scripts and classpath setup would not change.  The disadvantage is there is still the risk of transitive dependencies leaking into the main uber jar.\r\n> 2. Deploy Stellar code in a separate jar and add it to classpath after the main uber jar, whatever that is (metron-data-management, metron-enrichment-storm, etc).  This satisfies 3 because the separate Stellar jar can contain the relocated classes but other dependencies will not overwrite dependencies of the main uber jar (because it's listed after the main uber jar).  1 and 2 are not a concern when classifiers are used which is the case here.  The main disadvantage I see is that there will be work adding this extra jar in the various scripts or startup options and we may have to reorganize some classes.\r\n\r\n> This is all fairly complex so if anything is not clear I can elaborate. Are there other options I'm not thinking of? Thoughts?\r\n\r\nI really like your 3 proposed main requirements - those sound reasonable to me, with varying degrees of importance depending on how you look at them. I'd say that 3 is the most important in practice, with 1 and 2 supporting that goal.\r\n\r\nFirst big question I have is what about Stellar functions in metron-analytics? As I pointed out in this [comment](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1436#issuecomment-498369511) those are not core Stellar functions, but I suspect there's potential trouble there as well.\r\n\r\n**Other thoughts**\r\n\r\nWould it make sense to shade and relocate all of the core libs for Stellar and mark all others as scope `provided`? The litmus test here might be similar to how this is handled in J2EE web applications. \r\n1. If the web container (analogous to Storm in this case) provides a specific library, mark it as provided. \r\n2. If we absolutely want/need a conflicting version, then we would shade/relocate it. e.g. `com.fasterxml.jackson` is relocated as `org.apache.metron.jackson.${metron_jackson_version}` (credit @nickwallen on his work in the profiler libs with Guava relocation)\r\n\r\nThe catch with still using an uber jar (ie dep with the \"uber\" jar classifier) is that modules depending on it would still need to exclude the transitive dependencies that were relocated. The short of it being that the uber jar would have the relocated packages (e.g. org.apache.metron.jackson), but the transitive dependency still carries through as com.fasterxml.jackson when our uber jar is referenced as a dep. This is effectively very very similar to what you outlined and solved in approach 2 with the separate uber jar deploy, but should also cover the broader project classpath for all cases.\r\n\r\nWe spent multiple hours working on this together offline, so I won't rehash all of that here - you've done a reasonable job of summarizing a lot of the main bits.

A module that includes Stellar functions is not necessarily a problem.  The reason I focused on stellar-common is because it contains a substantial amount of custom code with specific dependency versions that often do not line up with versions required by other 3rd party dependencies (HBase, etc).  Moving all Stellar functions to stellar-common is an option but I don't think it's necessary right now.  We may want to do this for some classes but it can be done on a case-by-case basis as conflicts arise.  I think the important thing is to isolate stellar-common now since we know there are several conflicts and have a strategy in place for when conflicts in other modules happen.  The more extreme option would be to move all Stellar code to their own separate modules but I think that's overkill.\r\n\r\nI agree with your approach of relocating core libraries and marking others as `provided` where appropriate.  That makes sense to me.  For the case where a module depends on another module that uses the shade plugin and uber classifier, would we just mark that dependency as provided?  For example, if a module depends on stellar-common, stellar-common would be set to provided.  This way we wouldn't need to exclude dependencies that are rewritten.  This would also mean we need to go with the option of adding the uber jars to the classpath separately (option 2 above) but I think that is the correct approach anyways.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/508162804/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/508237241","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1436#issuecomment-508237241","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1436","id":508237241,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwODIzNzI0MQ==","user":{"login":"mmiklavc","id":658443,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODQ0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/658443?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc","html_url":"https://github.com/mmiklavc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-03T20:07:26Z","updated_at":"2019-07-03T20:07:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> For example, if a module depends on stellar-common, stellar-common would be set to provided.
