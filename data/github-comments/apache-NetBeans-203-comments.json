Better late than never ;) The extension is very useful for web frontends and it would be nice to keep.\r\n\r\nI attempted some tinkering with this and was able to get a working [Manifest V3](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/migrate/what-is-mv3) extension to some extent (debugging starts without an error, Browser DOM appears in NetBeans, changes propagate in Chrome, etc.) but the extension UI within the browser is now broken. \r\n\r\nHere is what what the Manifest V3 looks like:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"name\": \"__MSG__pluginName__\",\r\n    \"description\": \"__MSG__pluginDescription__\",\r\n    \"manifest_version\": 3,\r\n    \"minimum_chrome_version\": \"88\",\r\n    \"version\": \"1.1.6\",\r\n    \"homepage_url\": \"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/netbeans-connector/hafdlehgocfcodbgjnpecfajgkeejnaa\",\r\n    \"background\": {\r\n        \"service_worker\": \"js/background.js\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"devtools_page\": \"html/devtools.html\",\r\n    \"options_page\": \"html/options.html\",\r\n    \"action\": {\r\n        \"default_icon\": \"img/netbeans16.png\",\r\n        \"default_title\": \"Open NetBeans actions\",\r\n        \"default_popup\": \"html/popup.html\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"permissions\": [\r\n        \"contextMenus\",\r\n        \"tabs\",\r\n        \"debugger\",\r\n        \"storage\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"content_security_policy\": {\r\n        \"extension_pages\": \"default-src 'self'; connect-src ws://127.0.0.1:8008/\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"icons\": {\r\n        \"16\": \"img/netbeans16.png\",\r\n        \"48\": \"img/netbeans48.png\",\r\n        \"128\": \"img/netbeans128.png\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"default_locale\": \"en\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe service worker itself:\r\n```javascript\r\nimportScripts('../i18n/i18n.js', './common.js', './chrome.js');\r\n\r\nchrome.runtime.onStartup.addListener(function() {\r\n    chrome.action.disable();  \r\n});\r\n```\r\nCurrently this is only a \"duct tape fix\", just to get things up and running at all. Ideally, all [extension lifecycle](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/service-workers/lifecycle) stuff from common.js and chrome.js should go here. Ref. [Migrate to a service worker](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/migrate/to-service-workers).\r\n\r\nAlso [replaced some unsupported APIs](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/migrate/api-calls) and was able at least get the context menu item partially working:\r\n\r\nchrome.js, l.91 `chrome.pageAction.show(tabId);` > `chrome.action.enable(tabId);`\r\n\r\n...the context menu itself at line 119:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n    chrome.contextMenus.removeAll(function() {\r\n        chrome.contextMenus.create({\r\n            id: 'selectionMode',\r\n            title: NetBeans.contextMenuName(),\r\n            contexts: ['all'],\r\n            documentUrlPatterns: [NetBeans.contextMenuUrl],\r\n//  onclick does not work anymore with Manifest V3           \r\n//            onclick: function() {\r\n//                NetBeans.setSelectionMode(!NetBeans.getSelectionMode());\r\n//            }\r\n        },\r\n        function() {\r\n            NetBeans.contextMenuCreationInProgress = false;\r\n        });\r\n// Instead, addListener should be used...\r\n        chrome.contextMenus.onClicked.addListener((info, tab) => {\r\n            if (info.menuItemId === 'selectionMode') {\r\n                NetBeans.setSelectionMode(!NetBeans.getSelectionMode());\r\n            }\r\n        })\r\n```\r\n\r\ncommon.js l.182 `chrome.extension.onMessage.addListener` > `chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener`\r\n\r\nThis is the progress thus far. While it's not extensive, it might serve as a starting point. :) Although very well crafted, the extension is not overly simplistic, and while seeing it for the first time still need to figure out how

It's interesting that this causes Tofu characters ⍰ (square boxes) instead of question marks (?).\r\nI can reproduce this when I intentionally mismatch the project's output encoding (which on JDK17 and lower is the same as the native encoding) and the one in Netbeans (which when run on JDK17 should also be the native encoding).\r\n\r\nE.g. launching the Project with no-args on a West European locale with JDK 17 (output encoding=`cp1252`) and Netbeans 21 with (`-Dstdout.encoding=utf-8`)\r\n\r\nCould you try the following?\r\n\r\nExecute the following statements inside your project\r\n```java\r\n        System.out.println(\"Пример✨️\");\r\n        System.out.println(Runtime.version());\r\n        System.out.println(\"Charset.defaultCharset(): \" + Charset.defaultCharset());\r\n        System.out.println(\"file.encoding property:\" + System.getProperty(\"file.encoding\"));\r\n        System.out.println(\"native.encoding property:\" + System.getProperty(\"native.encoding\"));\r\n        System.out.println(\"sun.jnu.encoding property:\" + System.getProperty(\"sun.jnu.encoding\"));\r\n        System.out.println(\"stdout.encoding property:\" + System.getProperty(\"stdout.encoding\"));\r\n        System.out.println(\"sun.stdout.encoding property:\" + System.getProperty(\"sun.stdout.encoding\"));\r\n\r\n        if (System.console() != null) {\r\n            System.out.println(\"systemConsole encoding: \" + System.console().charset());\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then set `-J-Dsun.stdout.encoding=...`, `-J-Dstdout.encoding=...` and `-J-Dfile.encoding=...` to the output of the value of `sun.jnu.encoding` from the code block above.\r\n\r\nDoes this also solve your problem when using Netbeans 21 with JDK17 and the new launcher?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAnother thing that would be interesting: When doing the above, does it change anything when you explicitly set a font under

My first glance trigger my \"API!!!\"-reflex (from package name) and the second look then showed that the mercurial module has no public api.\r\n\r\nIt is done and cleanup, so I suggest to keep the change and merge as-is.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2028930014/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2029297225","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/7217#issuecomment-2029297225","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/7217","id":2029297225,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M549J5J","user":{"login":"neilcsmith-net","id":3975960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3975960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net","html_url":"https://github.com/neilcsmith-net","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-01T07:19:33Z","updated_at":"2024-04-01T07:19:33Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The `.github` folder is used - https://github.com/apache/netbeans/tree/master/.github\r\n\r\nWhat exactly are you having a problem with in there?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2029297225/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2029325929","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/7217#issuecomment-2029325929","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/7217","id":2029325929,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M549Q5p","user":{"login":"zacjoechap","id":32800306,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyODAwMzA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32800306?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zacjoechap","html_url":"https://github.com/zacjoechap","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zacjoechap/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zacjoechap/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zacjoechap/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zacjoechap/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zacjoechap/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zacjoechap/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zacjoechap/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zacjoechap/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zacjoechap/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-01T07:42:50Z","updated_at":"2024-04-01T07:42:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Interesting, I haven't encountered the `.github` folder before.
