It may have been clear to all but just to be sure... I've only been talking about an Edgent app on a gateway device _as a client of the IoT hub_ - how the gateway app publishes events to the hub as if they were from a \"connected device\" (a device serviced by the gateway) and how the gateway app receives commands from the hub that are for a connected device.  \r\n\r\nIotGateway.getIotDevice(...) wouldn't/shouldn't engage in any conversation with the hub.  It just gives the gateway app a handle representing the connected device's identity (which can be accessed via IotDevice.getDeviceId()) and the ability to publish events and/or to subscribe to events for that device.\r\n\r\n(Additionally, a gateway / the gateway app can publish device events to the hub from \"the gateway device id\" and subscribe to device commands for \"the gateway device id\".)\r\n\r\nThis topic/feature doesn't say anything about interactions from an Edgent gateway app with the gateway's connected devices.\r\n\r\nWhere does that leave us?

The default binary expectations apply.\n\nI've tested it locally by publishing to a local maven repo.

Once thats\nbeen done we can start talking about CI including pushes to ASF's internal\nnexus instances.  We would only push to maven central during a release,\nhence why the URLs are different.\n\nTo be honest, this isn't meant to be a one and done type of change, we'll\nneed to refine the release process a bit to clean up some of the issues, so\nI actually suspect this to be 1st of N pull requests on this JIRA.\n\n\n> We have a small amount of documentation for Publish to a Maven Repository\n> <https://github.com/apache/incubator-edgent/blob/master/DEVELOPMENT.md#publish-to-maven-repository>\n> Could you enhance that to cover these new non-local publish capabilities?\n> (the setup details and what gradle task to use for the local publish.
