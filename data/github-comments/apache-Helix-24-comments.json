We can think about other solutions to support you requirement.\r\n\r\nAbsolutely!  I would like to run a portion of my Helix participants on spot instances.  Spot instances allow one to cheaply scale processing when there is spare capacity.  The downside is that spot instances come and go, and when exactly is beyond my control.  Storage is disaggregated, so rebalancing helix resources is not expensive.\r\n\r\nI am not sure how best to configure helix for this model.  If host machines are fixed, when a host first starts up it can register itself as a helix instance and use that as the participant.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the hosts are not fixed (spot instances), as the spot instances come and go, I would end up with a forever increasing set of helix instances in zookeeper.\r\n\r\nI understand and share your concern about high traffic on the zookeeper path.  Would a better strategy be to try and re-use helix instances that are offline when a spot instance first starts up?  Or is there a better strategy that I'm not seeing?\r\n\r\nThank you

Below is a rough sketch of the required change as I see things.\r\n\r\n\r\n```java\r\n// Add criteria builder\r\npublic class HelixPurgeInstanceCriteriaBuilder {\r\n  public HelixPurgeInstanceCriteriaBuilder withSecondsOffline(int seconds);\r\n  public HelixPurgeInstanceCriteriaBuilder withTags(Set<String> tags);\r\n  public HelixPurgeInstanceCriteria build();\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Add purge instance criteria\r\npublic class HelixPurgeInstanceCriteria {\r\n  int getSecondsOffline();\r\n  Set<String> getTags();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**HelixAdmin:**\r\n```java\r\n// Add to HelixAdmin interface\r\nvoid purgeOfflineInstances(String clusterName, HelixPurgeInstanceCriteria purgeCriteria);\r\n```\r\n\r\n**ZkHelixAdmin:**\r\n```java\r\n// Override and implement in ZkHelixAdmin\r\nvoid purgeOfflineInstances(String clusterName, HelixPurgeInstanceCriteria purgeCriteria);\r\n\r\n// For backwards compatibility—keep old purgeOfflineInstances method signature as-is, replace the\r\n// implementation with new builder pattern that calls purgeOfflineInstances(clusterName, purgeCriteria)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nExample Usages:\r\n```java\r\n// Purge instances that have been offline for at least 1 hour and tagged\r\n// with both: \"worker\" and \"spot-instance\"\r\nHelixPurgeInstanceCriteria purgeCriteria = new HelixPurgeInstanceCriteriaBuilder()\r\n  .withSecondsOffline(3600)\r\n  .withTags(Set.of(\"worker\", \"spot-instance\"))\r\n  .build();\r\n\r\nadmin.purgeOfflineInstances(\"MyCluster\", purgeCriteria);\r\n```\r\n\r\n```java\r\n// Purge instances that have been offline for 1 day\r\nHelixPurgeInstanceCriteria purgeCriteria = new HelixPurgeInstanceCriteriaBuilder()\r\n  .withSecondsOffline(86400)\r\n  .build();\r\n\r\nadmin.purgeOfflineInstances(\"MyCluster\", purgeCriteria);\r\n```\r\n\r\n```java\r\n// Helix does not allow dropping instances that are online\r\nHelixPurgeInstanceCriteria purgeCriteria = new HelixPurgeInstanceCriteriaBuilder()\r\n  .build(); // Throws exception with message stating that withSecondsOffline is required\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Clarifying Point**\r\n`long offlineDuration` is currently used on purgeOfflineInstances; It's not clear on the current method signature or docs that this is in milliseconds. I thought `withSecondsOffline` would be more clear and intuitive.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Drop vs. Purge**\r\nHelixAdmin currently has these methods for dropping/purging:\r\n* `void dropInstance(String clusterName, InstanceConfig instanceConfig);` - singular, fails if instance is online\r\n* `void purgeOfflineInstances(String clusterName, long offlineDuration);` - plural, only applied to offline instances\r\n\r\nThough dropping a live instance is not supported now, in the future it could be?  If so `dropInstances(clusterName, dropCriteria)` may make more sense than `purgeOfflineInstances(clusterName, purgeCriteria)`.  In this world, if/when Helix supports dropping live instances, the builder would no longer throw an exception when withSecondsOffline isn't specified.\r\n\r\nIn my mind this feels more future proof.  I wanted to float this idea out there.  If this makes more sense I can refine the example code above.\r\n\r\n\r\nI welcome any suggestions.  Once aligned, would a PR be a sufficient starting point? Or should a JIRA be created to track this?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/962260090/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/963736497","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/helix/issues/1886#issuecomment-963736497","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/1886","id":963736497,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAPIHxc45cXOx","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-09T01:44:56Z","updated_at":"2021-11-09T01:44:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This test fails in: https://github.com/apache/helix/actions/runs/1437288754","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/963736497/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/966609458","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/helix/pull/1898#issuecomment-966609458","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/1898","id":966609458,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAPIHxc45nUoy","user":{"login":"xyuanlu","id":6392021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTIwMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6392021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu","html_url":"https://github.com/xyuanlu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-11T20:38:36Z","updated_at":"2021-11-11T20:38:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I will split his PR into 2 smaller ones.
