This can be accomplished with the Maven shade plugin (preferred) or the Maven assembly plugin (not<br/>\n    +recommended).<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +#### Flux Maven Dependency<br/>\n    +The current version of Flux is available in Maven Central at the following coordinates:<br/>\n    +```xml<br/>\n    +<dependency><br/>\n    +    <groupId>com.github.ptgoetz</groupId><br/>\n    +    <artifactId>flux-core</artifactId><br/>\n    +    <version>0.3.0</version><br/>\n    +</dependency><br/>\n    +```<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +#### Creating a Flux-Enabled Topology JAR<br/>\n    +The example below illustrates Flux usage with the Maven shade plugin:<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    + ```xml<br/>\n    +<!-- include Flux and user dependencies in the shaded jar --><br/>\n    +<dependencies><br/>\n    +    <!-- Flux include --><br/>\n    +    <dependency><br/>\n    +<groupId>com.github.ptgoetz</groupId><br/>\n    &#8212; End diff &#8211;</p>\n\n<p>    Once again, it should be changed to fit to Storm external.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612511234/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/99629737","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/546#issuecomment-99629737","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/546","id":99629737,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk5NjI5NzM3","user":{"login":"ptgoetz","id":260896,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDg5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/260896?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz","html_url":"https://github.com/ptgoetz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-06T22:27:14Z","updated_at":"2015-05-06T22:27:14Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@HeartSaVioR,\n\nThanks for the review!\n\nThanks for catching that...

No one should have to recompile or repackage an application in<br/>\n    +order to change configuration.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +## About<br/>\n    +Flux is a framework and set of utilities that make defining and deploying Apache Storm topologies less painful and<br/>\n    +deveoper-intensive.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +Have you ever found yourself repeating this pattern?:<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +```java<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {<br/>\n    +    // logic to determine if we're running locally or not...<br/>\n    +    // create necessary config options...<br/>\n    +    boolean runLocal = shouldRunLocal();<br/>\n    +    if(runLocal)</p>\n{\n    +LocalCluster cluster = new LocalCluster();\n    +cluster.submitTopology(name, conf, topology);\n    +    }\n<p> else </p>\n{\n    +StormSubmitter.submitTopology(name, conf, topology);\n    +    }\n<p>    +}<br/>\n    +```<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +Wouldn't something like this be easier:<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +```bash<br/>\n    +storm jar mytopology.jar org.apache.storm.flux.Flux --local config.yaml<br/>\n    +```<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +or:<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +```bash<br/>\n    +storm jar mytopology.jar org.apache.storm.flux.Flux --remote config.yaml<br/>\n    +```<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +Another pain point often mentioned is the fact that the wiring for a Topology graph is often tied up in Java code,<br/>\n    +and that any changes require recompilation and repackaging of the topology jar file. Flux aims to alleviate that<br/>\n    +pain by allowing you to package all your Storm components in a single jar, and use an external text file to define<br/>\n    +the layout and configuration of your topologies.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +## Features<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    + * Easily configure and deploy Storm topologies (Both Storm core and Microbatch API) without embedding configuration<br/>\n    +   in your topology code<br/>\n    + * Support for existing topology code (see below)<br/>\n    + * Define Storm Core API (Spouts/Bolts) using a flexible YAML DSL<br/>\n    + * YAML DSL support for most Storm components (storm-kafka, storm-hdfs, storm-hbase, etc.)<br/>\n    + * Convenient support for multi-lang components<br/>\n    + * External property substitution/filtering for easily switching between configurations/environments (similar to Maven-style<br/>\n    +   `${variable.name}` substitution)<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +## Usage<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +To use Flux, add it as a dependency and package all your Storm components in a fat jar, then create a YAML document<br/>\n    +to define your topology (see below for YAML configuration options).<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +### Building from Source<br/>\n    +The easiest way to use Flux, is to add it as a Maven dependency in you project as described below.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +If you would like to build Flux from source and run the unit/integration tests, you will need the following installed<br/>\n    +on your system:<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +* Python 2.6.x or later<br/>\n    +* Node.js 0.10.x or later<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +#### Building with unit tests enabled:<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +```<br/>\n    +mvn clean install<br/>\n    +```<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +#### Building with unit tests disabled:<br/>\n    +If you would like to build Flux without installing Python or Node.js you can simply skip the unit tests:<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +```<br/>\n    +mvn clean install -DskipTests=true<br/>\n    +```<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +Note that if you plan on using Flux to deploy topologies to a remote cluster, you will still need to have Python<br/>\n    +installed since it is required by Apache Storm.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +#### Building with integration tests enabled:<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +```<br/>\n    +mvn clean install -DskipIntegration=false<br/>\n    +```<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +### Packaging with Maven<br/>\n    +To enable Flux for your Storm components, you need to add it as a dependency such that it's included in the Storm<br/>\n    +topology jar. This can be accomplished with the Maven shade plugin (preferred) or the Maven assembly plugin (not<br/>\n    +recommended).<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +#### Flux Maven Dependency<br/>\n    +The current version of Flux is available in Maven Central at the following coordinates:<br/>\n    +```xml<br/>\n    +<dependency><br/>\n    +    <groupId>org.apache.storm</groupId><br/>\n    +    <artifactId>flux-core</artifactId><br/>\n    +    <version>${storm.version}</version><br/>\n    +</dependency><br/>\n    +```<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +#### Creating a Flux-Enabled Topology JAR<br/>\n    +The example below illustrates Flux usage with the Maven shade plugin:<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    + ```xml<br/>\n    +<!-- include Flux and user dependencies in the shaded jar --><br/>\n    +<dependencies><br/>\n    +    <!-- Flux include --><br/>\n    +    <dependency><br/>\n    +<groupId>org.apache.storm</groupId><br/>\n    +<artifactId>flux-core</artifactId><br/>\n    +<version>${storm.version}</version><br/>\n    +    </dependency><br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +    <!-- add user dependencies here... --><br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +</dependencies><br/>\n    +<!-- create a fat jar that includes all dependencies --><br/>\n    +<build><br/>\n    +    <plugins><br/>\n    +<plugin><br/>\n    +    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId><br/>\n    +    <artifactId>maven-shade-plugin</artifactId><br/>\n    +    <version>1.4</version><br/>\n    +    <configuration><br/>\n    +<createDependencyReducedPom>true</createDependencyReducedPom><br/>\n    +    </configuration><br/>\n    +    <executions><br/>\n    +<execution><br/>\n    +    <phase>package</phase><br/>\n    +    <goals><br/>\n    +<goal>shade</goal><br/>\n    +    </goals><br/>\n    +    <configuration><br/>\n    +<transformers><br/>\n    +    <transformer<br/>\n    +    implementation=\"org.apache.maven.plugins.shade.resource.ServicesResourceTransformer\"/><br/>\n    +    <transformer<br/>\n    +    implementation=\"org.apache.maven.plugins.shade.resource.ManifestResourceTransformer\"><br/>\n    +<mainClass>org.apache.storm.flux.Flux</mainClass><br/>\n    +    </transformer><br/>\n    +</transformers><br/>\n    +    </configuration><br/>\n    +</execution><br/>\n    +    </executions><br/>\n    +</plugin><br/>\n    +    </plugins><br/>\n    +</build><br/>\n    + ```<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +### Deploying and Running a Flux Topology<br/>\n    +Once your topology components are packaged with the Flux dependency, you can run different topologies either locally<br/>\n    +or remotely using the `storm jar` command. For example, if your fat jar is named `myTopology-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` you<br/>\n    +could run it locally with the command:<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +```bash<br/>\n    +storm jar myTopology-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar org.apache.storm.flux.Flux --local my_config.yaml<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +```<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +### Command line options<br/>\n    +```<br/>\n    +usage: storm jar <my_topology_uber_jar.jar> org.apache.storm.flux.Flux<br/>\n    +     <span class=\"error\">&#91;options&#93;</span> <topology-config.yaml><br/>\n    + <del>d,</del>-dry-run Do not run or deploy the topology.

Examples<br/>\n    +A collection of examples illustrating various capabilities.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +## Building From Source and Running<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +Checkout the projects source and perform a top level Maven build (i.e. from the `flux` directory):<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +```bash<br/>\n    +git clone <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm.git\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm.git</a><br/>\n    +cd storm<br/>\n    +mvn install -DskipTests=true<br/>\n    +```<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +This will create a shaded (i.e. \"fat\" or \"uber\") jar in the `external/flux/flux-examples/target` directory that can run/deployed with<br/>\n    +the `storm` command:<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +```bash<br/>\n    +cd flux-examples<br/>\n    +storm jar ./target/flux-examples-*-SNAPSHOT.jar org.apache.storm.flux.Flux --local ./src/main/resources/simple_wordcount.yaml<br/>\n    +```<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +The example YAML files are also packaged in the examples jar, so they can also be referenced with Flux's `--resource`<br/>\n    +command line switch:<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +```bash<br/>\n    +storm jar ./target/flux-examples-*.jar org.apache.storm.flux.Flux --local --resource /simple_wordcount.yaml<br/>\n    +```<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +## Available Examples<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +### <span class=\"error\">&#91;simple_wordcount.yaml&#93;</span>(src/main/resources/simple_wordcount.yaml)<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +This is a very basic wordcount example using Java spouts and bolts. It simply logs the running count of each word<br/>\n    +received.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +### <span class=\"error\">&#91;multilang.yaml&#93;</span>(src/main/resources/multilang.yaml)<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +Another wordcount example that uses a spout written in JavaScript (node.js), a bolt written in Python, and two bolts<br/>\n    +written in java.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +### <span class=\"error\">&#91;kafka_spout.yaml&#93;</span>(src/main/resources/kafka_spout.yaml)<br/>\n    +This example illustrates how to configure Storm's `storm-kafka` spout using Flux YAML DSL `components`, `references`,<br/>\n    +and `constructor arguments` constructs.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +### <span class=\"error\">&#91;simple_hdfs.yaml&#93;</span>(src/main/resources/simple_hdfs.yaml)<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +This example demonstrates using Flux to setup a storm-hdfs bolt to write to an HDFS cluster. It also demonstrates Flux's<br/>\n    +variable substitution/filtering feature.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +To run the `simple_hdfs.yaml` example, copy the `hdfs_bolt.properties` file to a convenient location and change, at<br/>\n    +least, the property `hdfs.url` to point to a HDFS cluster. Then you can run the example something like:<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +```bash<br/>\n    +storm jar ./target/flux-examples-*.jar org.apache.storm.flux.Flux --local ./src/main/resources/simple_hdfs.yaml --filter my_hdfs_bolt.properties<br/>\n    +```<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +### <span class=\"error\">&#91;simple_hbase.yaml&#93;</span>(src/main/resources/simple_hbase.yaml)<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +This example illustrates how to use Flux to setup a storm-hbase bolt to write to HBase.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +In order to use this example, you will need to edit the `src/main resrouces/hbase-site.xml` file to reflect your HBase<br/>\n    &#8212; End diff &#8211;</p>\n\n<p>    You may want to change how to run as same as simple_hdfs.yaml since you prepared hbase_bolt.properties and simple_hbase.yaml is ready to reflect.

I think there is a lot of fertile ground within storm to explore topology elasticity, resource awareness and resource utilization for the cluster.  Allowing topology owners to express their desired SLA opens up a lot of possibilities for automatically tuning the topology to meet both desired latency, throughput, and resource utilization and the relative importance of each.  We have been working with a few other researchers looking at resource aware scheduling and I think the two would complement each other very well.
