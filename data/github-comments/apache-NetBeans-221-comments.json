anyone who sees this problem on a regular basis, and is interested in contributing a fix, the following might be some good steps (note: requires some medium to advanced software development skills):\r\n\r\n1) Clone the Apache NetBeans source code repository, e.g. \"git clone https://github.com/apache/netbeans.git\"\r\n2) Switch to a nice, stable release branch, e.g. \"git checkout 22\" for NetBeans 22\r\n3) Build NetBeans by running the command \"ant\" in the root of the git repo. (This requires you to have Java and ant installed on your PATH.)\r\n4) Run NetBeans with \"ant tryme\". If NetBeans runs, great; you have successfully built NetBeans from source code!\r\n5) Now get acquainted with the file platform/o.n.bootstrap/src/org/netbeans/NbClipboard.java, which is where the bug will most likely have to be fixed. Insert some System.out.println statements to help you see what's going on. (You can open platform/o.n.bootstrap as a project in NetBeans to edit NbClipboard from the NetBeans IDE.)\r\n6) Exit the dev build of NetBeans, cd into platform/o.n.bootstrap and run \"ant\" again from that folder to recompile just that module, if you changed NbClipboard.java. Change the current directory back to the root directory and run \"ant tryme\" again.\r\n7) Now do some cutting and pasting in the editor and see that the System.out.println statements you inserted in step (5) produce some output. Look for print statements on the terminal rather than through View->IDE Log, as the latter has a delay of up to 10 seconds.\r\n8) Now do whatever it is you usually have to do to make the clipboard bug appear. Start investigating what, exactly, happens. (For some users the bug occurs only every few days. In that case, just use the dev build as your working IDE for a while, and investigate the bug whenever it occurs.)\r\n9) Go back to step 5 and add/adjust relevant print statements. Rinse and repeat until you figure out what, exactly, is causing the bug.\r\n10) Once we know what is causing the bug, it will usually be clear what solution is required...\r\n\r\nThis is almost just a guide to contributing to NetBeans in general, but it could be particularly helpful for this bug, which only certain users see regularly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2344797564/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2344801225","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/7743#issuecomment-2344801225","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/7743","id":2344801225,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6LwtPJ","user":{"login":"mbien","id":114367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien","html_url":"https://github.com/mbien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-11T22:19:37Z","updated_at":"2024-09-11T22:19:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"many if not most of the namespace URIs are essentially UIDs, this would also explain your observation of:\r\n\r\n> After upgrading the name space for primefaces from http to https, the application doesnt work.\r\n\r\nSo this can't be blindly replaced.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2344801225/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2346534267","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/7747#issuecomment-2346534267","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/7747","id":2346534267,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6L3UV7","user":{"login":"sid-srini","id":175113207,"node_id":"U_kgDOCnAD9w","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/175113207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sid-srini","html_url":"https://github.com/sid-srini","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sid-srini/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sid-srini/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sid-srini/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sid-srini/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sid-srini/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sid-srini/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sid-srini/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sid-srini/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sid-srini/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-12T14:55:57Z","updated_at":"2024-09-12T14:55:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> I went through the patch - overall seems sensible.

I will try to add this. \r\n- Currently, this is implemented only for Java.\r\n- So, shall I add this only in the specific UI for _Java_ within the _Editor_ > _Code Completions_ preferences? \r\n- Perhaps later when someone else needs this implemented for other languages, it could be exposed there.\r\n\r\n> I'm curious at the reasoning for adding this where it is? It seems similar to the guess filled method arguments option? Between them they feel like they cover 3 states?

However, it may become difficult to move the first setting to other languages.\r\n\r\nLet me know if this analysis makes sense.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2346657085/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2346772913","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/7747#issuecomment-2346772913","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/7747","id":2346772913,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6L4Omx","user":{"login":"neilcsmith-net","id":3975960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3975960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net","html_url":"https://github.com/neilcsmith-net","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-12T16:40:31Z","updated_at":"2024-09-12T16:40:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Sure, I agree with keeping as two boolean flags.

This was first just a concern I voiced under the PR which changed it but got confirmed by flatpak on fedora (which is the only way to install NB \"out of the box\" there), which started using the **wrong** icon - screenshot provided in the issue.\r\n\r\nSo all those questions don't _actually_ matter. NB needs the NB vector graphics logo in the zip to make it for everyone _obvious_ what the logo is - I have no problem with variants of it if someone is willing to maintain those variants but it obviously also needs the original.

Similar to bower, grunt, gulp, node, karma etc. It is just an idea but could be part of a different PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2352644675/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2353192005","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/7713#issuecomment-2353192005","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/7713","id":2353192005,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6MQtxF","user":{"login":"NReib","id":120319811,"node_id":"U_kgDOByvvQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/120319811?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NReib","html_url":"https://github.com/NReib","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NReib/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NReib/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NReib/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NReib/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NReib/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NReib/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NReib/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NReib/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NReib/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-16T15:07:05Z","updated_at":"2024-09-16T15:07:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I am using \r\njavac --version \r\njavac 17.0.11\r\n\r\nThe code sometimes stilll unfolds","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2353192005/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2353748350","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/7732#issuecomment-2353748350","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/7732","id":2353748350,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6MS1l-","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-16T19:30:38Z","updated_at":"2024-09-16T19:30:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@lahodaj I updated the `prepare` project to also cover the renamed `ThirdPartyNoticeText.txt` file.

I am sure nobody would have anything against a setting in the options or a toggle button directly on the output window toolbar, but single file programs are nothing special, they are no dialect and not exclusive for beginners - there is value in consistent behavior.
