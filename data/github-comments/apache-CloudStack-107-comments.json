We've a test_staticroles.py too, that can do pre-upgrade integration testing and post-upgrade we've test_dynamicroles.py. Lastly, it is intended to make reverse-migration difficult to avoid inconsistent and unknown security behavior, read FS for details. If you simply turn off the restricted global setting (from true to false), it will disable both dynamic and static checker. One constraint for this to enable is that a flag in db is enabled and commands.properties file does not exist or readable from its classpath. Also, since commands.properties is removed even if you switch the flags you'll need to create this file, put in client/tomcatconf (as developer) and restart mgmt server as unlike dynamic-checker, the static checker initializes only at boot time and not runtime.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/214212648/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/214229683","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1517#issuecomment-214229683","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1517","id":214229683,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNDIyOTY4Mw==","user":{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-25T09:29:00Z","updated_at":"2016-04-25T09:29:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I found this article by Oracle MySQL team useful: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-prepare-for-your-mysql-5-7-upgrade\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/214229683/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/214233279","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1502#issuecomment-214233279","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1502","id":214233279,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNDIzMzI3OQ==","user":{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-25T09:34:24Z","updated_at":"2016-04-25T09:34:24Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@wido thanks for the comments.

See the integration test, we're using user api clients (search self.getUserApiClient) to perform tests -- i.e. tests are not run all as root admin only. What you're asking is already covered, they are also run by Travis.\n\nI'm sorry if the discussion confused you, please re-read FS again but let me try to explain below as well;\n\nBy default, we don't want to encourage new users to use static checker which is why dynamic-checker is enabled for developers/new-users. For this reason the commands.properties.in file in codebase has been deprecated. In packaging too, we're not including commands.properties file.\n\nFor existing deployments, we are _NOT_ forcing users to migrate to the dynamic roles feature and their existing commands.properties file won't be renamed or removed during upgrade. Though, the upgrade path will add dynamic-role specific tables/schema and default roles. There is an upgrade/migrate script for such users who can migrate in future at their wish, the script will read rules from commands.properties file and put them in DB.\n\nPlease read the admin docs too if they help you understand the process:\nhttps://github.com/apache/cloudstack-docs-admin/pull/37\n\nNow, once a user is already using dynamic checker (fresh or migrated at a later stage), we don't want them to be easily able to migrate back to static checker as allowing admin to do that with a global setting switch is a security issue (sorry being pessimistic here). Therefore, we do two checks to evaluate if dynamic roles is allowed:\n- check if the global setting says that dynamic roles is enabled\n- check that commands.properties does not exist\n  The reverse is true for static checker, see the isEnabled()/isDisabled method in the checker implementation.\n\nWrt to what must have happened in your env: If a user disables the global setting flag to disable dynamic roles and it does not have the commands.properties in class path; this will disable both dynamic and static roles checkers as static role checker reads commands.properties file at load time (which did not exist in your env). \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/214276787/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/214281121","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1489#issuecomment-214281121","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1489","id":214281121,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNDI4MTEyMQ==","user":{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-25T11:54:20Z","updated_at":"2016-04-25T11:54:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@koushik-das can you share what you think are the advantages of static role-base api checker?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/214281121/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/214296336","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1489#issuecomment-214296336","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1489","id":214296336,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNDI5NjMzNg==","user":{"login":"koushik-das","id":11499860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk5ODYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11499860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das","html_url":"https://github.com/koushik-das","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-25T12:34:25Z","updated_at":"2016-04-25T12:34:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rhtyd My comment regarding the test was more in the context of perf. test. In the DB for regular user I saw ~250 permissions got created. So this means iterating over all these entries twice (ALLOW and DENY) to find a match and then perform access check. There will be a perf. overhead due to this and user should have an option to decide whether to use static or dynamic. Also if the user finds some issues/bugs later during their testing there should be a fallback option.\n\nRegarding upgrade implications, I went through the docs/FS but some things are still confusing.

In the DB for regular user I saw ~250 permissions got created. So this means iterating over all these entries twice (ALLOW and DENY) to find a match and then perform access check.\n\nThe two checkPermissions calls would not cause significant overhead as they are done in memory and cost a maximum (worst case) of O(n) computation (on same machine). While making two DB calls (once to get all ALLOW rules and once to get all DENY rules) is more expensive as we do two network calls to get the data and still hit worst case O(n) computation.\n\nFor a dynamic access checking system, this is a trade off and also a feature. In case of static checker we've now, rules are loaded at load-time only; any change requires restart and rules can be inconsistent across server(s).\n\n> There will be a perf. overhead due to this and user should have an option to decide whether to use static or dynamic.\n\nUsers do have a choice, they can choose to not migrate to this feature. Typically, in production organizations would run multiple management servers; mgmt servers can be horizontally scaled to meet demanding usage. For example, they can can mgmt server on a separate machine (which they generally do) and tune their databases to accept up to 50k requests (or qps), optimize innodb settings (buffer pool size to 60% of memory etc.) and in db.properties increase num. of db connections from 250 to 1000.\n\n> Also if the user finds some issues/bugs later during their testing there should be a fallback option.\n\nThere is a way to revert back to using static checker as I explained earlier, (1) switch off the global settings and (2) put back a commands.properties file in class-path usually at /etc/cloudstack/management; it's just that we don't want users to do it easily. Consider this an admin creates a read-only admin role and accounts with that (such users can only do list\\* calls), now if they go back to static-checker all such users now become default root admin (based on account type, translation) and can call all APIs defined in commands.properties -- this is a significant security risk. Therefore, I personally don't want to put users at risk and just discourage them using the static checker.\n\n> Regarding upgrade implications, I went through the docs/FS but some things are still confusing. If existing user can continue using commands.properties then what happens to the new APIs that gets added.\n\nIn case you're not aware, with the current system each time a user upgrade they have to edit/add new rules to commands.properties by hand. Upgrading using packages does not update commands.properties file; it would create a .rpmnew/rpmsave file for example. In case of multiple mgmt server, you have to do this on all server(s) and restart all of them. While in case of dynamic roles based checker, you don't need to restart mgmt server at all (even during migration). I'm not sure why you say the static checker way is flexible, on the contrary I think it is not and a pain point of a lot of people.\n\n> If the argument is that the permission can be put in as an annotation in code for new APIs then that removes the flexibility of the earlier mechanism (there is no way to modify the default in code).\n\nThis has existed for so long, but  not popular among API writers. Even before this feature, there have been few APIs using the annotation; the static checker also uses annotation as a fallback (i.e. not something I've introduced).\n\nThere is a way to modify default behavior by adding authorized field in @APIParam. See the new APIs implementation for example. I've added a section in the FS on how new APIs should be written if they need to be enabled by default for a role type; alternatively the release notes should properly document new APIs and leave the choice of allowing/denying those APIs to (custom) roles.\n\n> We don't know how people are customising commands.properties and removing the flexibility may not be a good idea.\n\nOn the contrary, we've giving flexibility to people. It might make sense to enable certain features for all role types or a subset of them. We have deny rules (with API and wildcards supported) in case they want to override the default. Consider this, you wrote an API and enabled for users; the system admin can explicitly add allow rules and add a * deny rule that is to say deny all (if not allowed) and the dynamic roles system would not consider default rules in annotations at all.\n\n> The question is not about advantage of static checker, but more about choice and stability of the new mechanism.\n\nThere is both choice and stability. We've tried our best to make this feature a drop in replacement that is strictly backward compatibility, with good integration tests and coverage on critical pieces. In fact, the integration tests run with Travis to ensure this becomes one of the critical smoke tests and aims to provide nearly 100% end-to-end coverage.\n\nIf you've any code specific reservation or suggestions on improving it, I'll be happy to fix them.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/214430311/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/214432357","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1493#issuecomment-214432357","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1493","id":214432357,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNDQzMjM1Nw==","user":{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-25T16:37:09Z","updated_at":"2016-04-25T16:37:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@swill done, though as I mentioned in the comments above the test that failed in last travis run is a component test and fails on master too (i.e. not related to this PR).

I also know that the class ‚ÄúTestAppender‚Äù is there to be reused in some other tests that want to check the use of log; but still, it feels pretty complicated to me. Giving that, do you see why when I created the test as an example for @Syed, I used the Mocking approach? It feels simpler and more natural to write tests using that approach, at least to me.\n\nAdditionally, I was curious when you mentioned that the use of ‚Äústatic final‚Äù delimiters could optimize the GC, given that it (the GC) would not check if those attributes have or not to be garbage collected. I had never heard that before, so I tried to find something online. If you have some reliable reference about that, could you share?\n\nI tried to find some specs or guideline documents from either Oracle or OpenJDK without much success.  However, I found something like you said to the android JVM [1], but that would not be our case. Then, I read some articles (not scientific ones) from IBM [2] and Oracle [3] about the tuning of java code. But still, they did not mention anything related to what you said. Then, I decided to revisit a forum that I did not visit for a long time, since the time of my first Java certification (I am definitely getting old :( ), the coderanch [4]. There I found something that may be related to what you said [5]. There was a discussion there about the GC and static variables; at some point, someone highlights that ‚ÄúStatic variables are destroyed when the class is unloaded‚Äù.  After that, I also found this [6] on Stack overflow, in which it is described that ‚ÄúStatic variables cannot be elected for garbage collection while the class is loaded. They can be collected when the respective class loader (that was responsible for loading this class) is itself collected for garbage.‚Äù. I believe that was the point you wanted to make, right? Static variables are not GCed by the GC, they are not even checked.\n\nIf that was the case, it would have nothing to do with the ‚Äúfinal‚Äù keyword per se, but rather with the use of the ‚Äústatic‚Äù keyword.\n\nAfter having said that, perhaps we could benefit from both worlds? I mean we could still use the ‚ÄúLogger‚Äù variable as static, but not final; then, we would be able to write a test case using Mockito (as the first example I presented to @Syed), which would add less code.\nWhat do you think about that?\n\nAdditionally, I had taken a look at some spring framework code. Their framework is not only the base of ACS but also many other huge projects; so, I thought it would be interesting to see how they use the logger variables. They use their ‚Äúlogger‚Äù attributes as Object variables and not Classes. With that approach when you extend their code, you ‚Äúget for free‚Äù a logger instance to be used. I believe that is why I am so used to loggers being object attributes. I might have been working too much with their components and frameworks.\n\nWhen we do that, we can avoid the following example that happens in ACS:\nLet‚Äôs take the example of ‚ÄúNfsSecondaryStorageResource‚Äù class. That class is an intermediate class to singletons (LocalNfsSecondaryStorageResource, MockLocalNfsSecondaryStorageResource, PremiumSecondaryStorageResource and SimulatorSecondaryStorageResource). All of them also have a Logger instance for their respective class. Also, the ‚ÄúNfsSecondaryStorageResource‚Äù extends the ‚ÄúServerResourceBase‚Äù that has a Logger instance too. In total, we have 5 Logger instances. One for each class, giving that all of them are static attributes. If we used an approach similar to the one that is used by Spring-*, we would have one ‚ÄúLogger‚Äù instance for each singleton, which would represent 4 logger instances.\n\nI did some tests, and the approximated size of a Logger instance is ~820 bytes. So, if we save the instantiation of a few of this we can reduce a little bit of the use of ACS memory, giving that due to the way we create ‚ÄúLogger‚Äù objects today, we have an instance even for classes that are not object per se, but intermediated classes in a hierarchy of singletons.\n\n[1] http://developer.android.com/training/articles/perf-tips.html\n[2] http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-jtp01274/\n[3] https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E26576_01/doc.312/e24936/tuning-apps.htm#GSPTG00161\n[4] http://www.coderanch.com\n[5] http://www.coderanch.com/t/381848/java/java/Garbage-Collector-Static-Variables\n[6] http://stackoverflow.com/questions/453023/are-static-fields-open-for-garbage-collection\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/214509189/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/214518411","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1331#issuecomment-214518411","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1331","id":214518411,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNDUxODQxMQ==","user":{"login":"jburwell","id":285646,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTY0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/285646?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell","html_url":"https://github.com/jburwell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-25T20:54:01Z","updated_at":"2016-04-25T20:54:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rafaelweingartner yes, as I have said, `final statics` are not evaluated for GC.  A single case is not a noticeable problem.  However, if made all loggers were made instance variables, given the number we have, it would become a problem.  You stated that your preference was to make loggers instance variables, and that they being `final static` was purely cosmetic.  My point is that there are both performance and capability motivations to make them `final static` (i.e. the ability to log from static methods and accumulated GC overhead).\n\nPersonally, I use Mockito (and its ilk) sparingly.  Namely, I only use it in circumstances where language constructs are unable to mock a mechanism.  First, I find it more difficult to understand the intentions of a test using Mockito rather than pure Java as it layers another set of abstractions onto the test.  Second, Mockito approaches discourage reuse.  We could use Mockito to mock logging tests in this case.  However, we have done nothing to make testing of expected logging easier for future test cases.\n\nIt's most important to me that we do not start turning references to constant values into instance variables due to potential GC churn.  It's less a memory size issue than it is about the length of GC operations and CPU overhead.  The Mockito vs. `TestAppender` approach is up to @syed and what he feels most comfortable implementing.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/214518411/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/214529726","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1331#issuecomment-214529726","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1331","id":214529726,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNDUyOTcyNg==","user":{"login":"rafaelweingartner","id":4129005,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjkwMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4129005?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelweingartner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-25T21:30:55Z","updated_at":"2016-04-25T21:30:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I do not find them (final static) purely cosmetics (we are using too much this expression lately).  I understand its use, as I presented the references about the GC and static variables. Maybe we could use only the static keyword? That is what I am saying. The final keyword would work more like an assurance, so no one can change that reference during runtime. But, I believe we do not need such guarantees, right?\n\nI could not find anything (specs or guides from Oracle or OpenJDK) saying that the \"final\" keyword would provide such improvements. Maybe you could help me find something to clarify my doubts?\n\nAbout logging from static methods, I do not find that argument appealing. Even though static methods may be appealing, they are easier to use and code, not needing to integrate into a framework life cycle to wire all of the dependencies. I believe that if we have an ‚Äúutil‚Äù class with static methods, then it (the util class) will have a static variable ‚ÄúLogger‚Äù; now, mixing static methods into a singleton;  I see that as an anti-pattern. This is very personal, I like to delegate very specific tasks to each class. I believe that facilitates the design of the software and the writing of test cases (both unit and integration one)\n\nI understand your feelings about Mockc. I had the same some time ago when I started working with TDD. At that time I used Easymock. But still, the point is that, once we start writing test cases (the unit ones), we get into a moment in which we have to write integration tests. That means a method that uses few methods that are self-contained and unit tested. Therefore, we do not need to test the whole method (we already assured that the units are working), but only check if the method is calling the methods (units) it should (checking the order), with the parameters that are expected and at the end returning what we expect it to return. To facilitate that job we would need to use Mocks, then we would not have to prepare complicated set ups to write our tests.\n\nAbout the overhead problems to the GC, as I said, I am talking about singletons, they are created only once in the whole application life cycle.

If I still to explicitly put the value, it would be `False` on all test cases within `test_outofbandmanagement.py`\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/214637482/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/214660883","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1417#issuecomment-214660883","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1417","id":214660883,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNDY2MDg4Mw==","user":{"login":"nitt10prashant","id":11593920,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTkzOTIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11593920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitt10prashant","html_url":"https://github.com/nitt10prashant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitt10prashant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitt10prashant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitt10prashant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitt10prashant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitt10prashant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitt10prashant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitt10prashant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitt10prashant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitt10prashant/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-26T08:01:10Z","updated_at":"2016-04-26T08:07:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@swill seedTemplateFromVmSnapshot is new API got introduced with this feature , if marvin installation is up to date it should have this API @bvbharat  can you please confirm if we have latest marvin installation \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/214660883/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/214667168","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1502#issuecomment-214667168","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1502","id":214667168,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNDY2NzE2OA==","user":{"login":"DaanHoogland","id":2486961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODY5NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2486961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland","html_url":"https://github.com/DaanHoogland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-26T08:30:23Z","updated_at":"2016-04-26T08:31:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rhtyd got ya.

If the user doesn't want the dynamic roles for whatever reason he shouldn't be forced to use it. There should be a one time choice given to users if they want to use dynamic roles. If user decides to go ahead with it, do the data migration and there shouldn't be an option to come back to static checker (for the reasons you have rightly mentioned).
