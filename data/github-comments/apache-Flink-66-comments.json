Otherwise if the user sets `useQuadTree` to true, the algorithm should check whether quadtree can be used or not.\n\nI don't think that `ListBuffer` is better than `Vector`. For example, we can implement `partitionBox` like following:\n\n``` scala\ndef partitionBox(cPart: Seq[Vector], L: Vector): Seq[Vector] = {\n  var next = cPart\n  (0 until L.size).foreach { i =>\n    next = next.flatMap { v =>\n      val (up, down) = (v.copy, v)\n      up.update(i, up(i) - L(i) / 4)\n      down.update(i, down(i) + L(i) / 4)\n\n      Seq(up, down)\n    }\n  }\n\n  next\n}\n```\n\nThere are still some style issues in this PR. I recommend reformatting all codes in this PR using IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/146202529/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/146203981","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1208#issuecomment-146203981","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1208","id":146203981,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NjIwMzk4MQ==","user":{"login":"ktzoumas","id":1925554,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjU1NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1925554?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktzoumas","html_url":"https://github.com/ktzoumas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktzoumas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktzoumas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktzoumas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktzoumas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktzoumas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktzoumas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktzoumas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktzoumas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktzoumas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-07T14:00:49Z","updated_at":"2015-10-07T14:00:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Once https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1238 is merged, this is ready to be merged as well (the docs track the changes in that PR)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/146203981/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/146204887","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1235#issuecomment-146204887","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1235","id":146204887,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NjIwNDg4Nw==","user":{"login":"mxm","id":837221,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNzIyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/837221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm","html_url":"https://github.com/mxm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-07T14:04:47Z","updated_at":"2015-10-07T14:04:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Outside of the Hadoop world.

I think it's easier to review this way.\n\nThe major points:\n- Followed all renaming suggestions.\n- Removed the checkpoint ID counter and replaced with .\n- Left the submission to fail in case of concurrent modifications to have clear error messages. The behaviour in such cases is rather undefined at the moment.\n- Your description about the terminally failing behaviour is correct. The behaviour was on purpose for the initial version. The root zNode essentially identifies the cluster at the moment.  We can fix this is to use a per cluster random root zNode, e.g. `/flink/random/...` instead of `/flink/...` What do you think? In any case, I would do this as a quick follow up.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/146297139/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/146297878","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1235#issuecomment-146297878","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1235","id":146297878,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NjI5Nzg3OA==","user":{"login":"uce","id":1756620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTY2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1756620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce","html_url":"https://github.com/uce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-07T19:09:26Z","updated_at":"2015-10-07T19:09:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"PS Enforcing hdfs:// would also not allow local testing.

, I looked at your changes to enable the dashboard on yarn. Looks good. :)\n\nA few comments to make sure this PR can directly start working after yours:\nI would like to rename the yarn log files to `jobmanager.log`, `jobmanager.out` and `jobmanager.err`. Can you do this with your commit?\nFurther, the web runtime resources and log file paths are entirely different things. Right now, in normal mode, I can assume that the log files are present under the directory `flink.base.dir.key/log`. However, that won't be the case in yarn. What would be the best way to pass the log directory path to Web runtime? Should it be given as an argument or as an environment variable? I'm more inclined towards an ev.\n\nAfter you address my comments, I will rebase this on top of your PR and check if everything works. :)\n\nEdit: Going through the yarn code, I found out that there is already access to the log path under the key `JOB_MANAGER_WEB_LOG_PATH_KEY`. I will change my code to search for the log files under this directory the way it was being done in `LogFileInfoServlet`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/146433225/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/146438040","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1236#issuecomment-146438040","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1236","id":146438040,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NjQzODA0MA==","user":{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-08T06:56:20Z","updated_at":"2015-10-08T06:56:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the review @iampeter :smile: \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/146438040/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/146439104","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1236#issuecomment-146439104","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1236","id":146439104,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NjQzOTEwNA==","user":{"login":"sachingoel0101","id":8874261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NzQyNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8874261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101","html_url":"https://github.com/sachingoel0101","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-08T07:02:57Z","updated_at":"2015-10-08T07:02:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@iampeter , thanks for the review.
