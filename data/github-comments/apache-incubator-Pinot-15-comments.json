Server does not pass back group-by column names back to broker, broker need to attach the group-by column names itself. If you try any UDF group-by query, you will find that all UDF column names are missing in the query response.\r\nBesides that, you mentioned that you saw compile time in the profiler, which means compiling query in the server side might cause performance downgrade. We'd better bring this up to the whole team to make the decision.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/274318741/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/274342505","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/967#issuecomment-274342505","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/967","id":274342505,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NDM0MjUwNQ==","user":{"login":"mayankshriv","id":12615885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjE1ODg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12615885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv","html_url":"https://github.com/mayankshriv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-22T16:49:53Z","updated_at":"2017-01-22T16:49:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Jackie-Jiang I am probably missing something, other than creating broker response, why does the broker need to know the group-by-column names? If that is the only reason, broker has access to BrokerRequest and can get both group-by-column names as well as expressions, without any additional processing/compiling. I made a one line  local change (not part of this RB, yet), and can see broker returning UDF as group-by column name, snippet below:\r\n        \"groupByColumns\": [\"add(l_tax, 1)\"]\r\n\r\nAnd the avg query parsing time (not just expression) is 0.2 ms (as per my benchmark). Still I don't want non-udf code to exercise that part, hence the extra logic.\r\n\r\nI can definitely call a meeting to discuss this, but so far I am unable to see any architectural issue with this approach. The only temporary issue until we have full support for udf is client's need to call handle presence of columns/expressions in group-by explicitly, something I think we should be able to handle in future RB.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/274342505/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/274664114","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/984#issuecomment-274664114","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/984","id":274664114,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NDY2NDExNA==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-24T00:34:15Z","updated_at":"2017-01-24T00:34:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## [Current coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/linkedin/pinot/pull/984?src=pr) is 66.54% (diff: 100%)\n\n\n> No coverage report found for **master** at 1d8b016.\n\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io?src=pr).

With this, we load 100G in worst case that too on SSDs which isn't much more workload.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/275541245/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/275566744","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/1005#issuecomment-275566744","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/1005","id":275566744,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NTU2Njc0NA==","user":{"login":"cyenjung","id":1437087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzcwODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1437087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyenjung","html_url":"https://github.com/cyenjung","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyenjung/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyenjung/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyenjung/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyenjung/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyenjung/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyenjung/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyenjung/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyenjung/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyenjung/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-27T01:30:55Z","updated_at":"2017-01-27T01:30:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"1.

Helix state will still indicate this as CONSUMING, which is a TBD fix that I mentioned in the commit comment.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/278096864/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/278098594","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/1036#issuecomment-278098594","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/1036","id":278098594,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3ODA5ODU5NA==","user":{"login":"mcvsubbu","id":2279037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzkwMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2279037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu","html_url":"https://github.com/mcvsubbu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-07T18:38:55Z","updated_at":"2017-02-07T18:38:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mayankshriv to answer your questions:\r\n\r\n1.  Exponential back off policy already introduces a randomness. This code had exponential back-off before (and perhaps that is why we did not see this issue for a long time) and I changed it to linear in a recent check-in. Linear did not have any randomness.\r\n2. The lock will help us complete the segments in minimal amount of time, with each update happening in succession. The back-off is still needed because we will be contending with RetentionManager, or a segment deletion call from the console. If any of those happen when we are trying to update the idealstate, we need to retry.\r\n3. I have unit tests for the classes. Obviously, it is not easy to test this condition. Once I have a better handle on how to get out of this situation, I will add unit tests mocking the requisite states to get us into this situation. For now, the only test is to roll it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/278098594/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/278123465","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/1036#issuecomment-278123465","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/1036","id":278123465,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3ODEyMzQ2NQ==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-07T20:04:20Z","updated_at":"2017-02-07T20:04:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/linkedin/pinot/pull/1036?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> :exclamation: No coverage uploaded for pull request base (`master@abf5b83`).

Optimize realtime segment generation by folding in the stats collector object into the RecordReader. The realtime record reader does not have to do a full pass through the data to get the things needed for segment creation, in that case.\r\n\r\n2. We will keep the old tar file generated and remove it only when when the segment goes to ONLINE state. This is for a back-up that we may not use ultimately, but good to have so that we can prevent infinite loop.\r\n\r\n3. We will enhance the completion protocol to include a lease time in the COMMIT message from the SegmentCompletionManager. This is the max time that is given to the servers to build a segment. If the server does not complete building the segment during this time, it will send a new message to ask for more time. The SegmentCompletionManager maintains info on time taken to build the segment and adjusts the initial lease value accordingly.\r\n\r\nWe will table the other options for now until we have these and take fresh measurements.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/285445065/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/285584976","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/1106#issuecomment-285584976","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/1106","id":285584976,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NTU4NDk3Ng==","user":{"login":"cyenjung","id":1437087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzcwODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1437087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyenjung","html_url":"https://github.com/cyenjung","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyenjung/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyenjung/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyenjung/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyenjung/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyenjung/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyenjung/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyenjung/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyenjung/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyenjung/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-10T05:55:08Z","updated_at":"2017-03-10T05:55:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"You code cannot be built on travis.

I suggest experimenting by generating a pinot segment, estimating how many segments you will need at any given time, what your replication factor is, and set up number of servers depending on the memory requirement. Pinot segments are stored in memory, so this is a start. You may need more servers to improve query throughput (or less, if your query rate is low, you may just MMAP the segments).\r\n\r\nHaving more than one controller and more than one broker is always a good idea in production.\r\n\r\nIt is your choice whether you want to use Hybrid or real-time-only solution. Hybrid may work better (at this time) if your retention is larger than a few days. \r\n\r\n-Subbu","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/286155818/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/286248901","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/1139#issuecomment-286248901","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/1139","id":286248901,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NjI0ODkwMQ==","user":{"login":"apucher","id":25439965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NDM5OTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25439965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apucher","html_url":"https://github.com/apucher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apucher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apucher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apucher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apucher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apucher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apucher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apucher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apucher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apucher/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-13T21:26:01Z","updated_at":"2017-03-13T21:26:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Also seems to fix #1140.
