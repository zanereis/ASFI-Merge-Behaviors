In reality a lot of sites won't automatically upgrade to this, but it is important to know anyway.\r\n\r\nConcretely, this means tracers can start offering the ability to send in the new format, ex via kafka (sqs azure hub etc) or POST /api/v2/spans. This format is the same as what we're using internally in Elasticsearch 6.x (#1674), and will be the default choice for document stores.\r\n\r\nI'm cc'ing you for heads up in case you'd like to try using this, or update your libraries to support it. In the next few weeks a lot of stuff around this will be landing tracked in #1644.

I took a quick look at some SaaS offerings for RabbitMQ ([AmqpHosting.com](https://www.amqphosting.com/faq), [CloudAMQP](https://www.cloudamqp.com/), and [Compose](https://www.compose.com/databases/rabbitmq)) and cloud providers' RabbitMQ offerings ([Azure](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/bitnami.rabbitmq?tab=PlansAndPrice), [Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/launcher/details/click-to-deploy-images/rabbitmq?pli=1), and [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://docs.pivotal.io/rabbitmq-cf/1-7/)). They all seem to keep up-to-date with the latest stable, and most of the SaaS offerings provide one-click RabbitMQ cluster version upgrades.\r\n\r\nThat said, companies managing their own RabbitMQ servers are quite likely not on the latest version. Even so, our use case should be straight forward enough. That is, I wouldn't expect our use case to have had backwards incompatibilities introduced in the past few years (famous last words).\r\nSince there is a [RabbitMQ server Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/rabbitmq/), we could use TestContainers to test against any version of the server we want fairly easily.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAlso, let me reduce the scope on this issue to just collection since that is all that would be implemented in this repo. We can still list tracers that support reporting to RabbitMQ here after collection is implemented in case people find this issue when searching. I will open and link an issue in zipkin-reporter-java for reporting to RabbitMQ, for now.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/323575569/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/323654019","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/1579#issuecomment-323654019","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1579","id":323654019,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMzY1NDAxOQ==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-21T06:05:39Z","updated_at":"2017-08-21T06:05:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"gonna close this as we should re-evaluate with the new single-type index.

The elasticsearch copy will be deleted later.\r\n\r\ncc @anuraaga","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/325242415/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/325243147","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1644#issuecomment-325243147","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1644","id":325243147,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNTI0MzE0Nw==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-28T02:04:07Z","updated_at":"2017-08-28T02:04:07Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"openzipkin/zipkin#1711 << elasticsearch uses spanstore2 api\r\nopenzipkin/zipkin#1710 << expose spanstore2 http api","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/325243147/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/325271539","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1499#issuecomment-325271539","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1499","id":325271539,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNTI3MTUzOQ==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-28T06:34:31Z","updated_at":"2017-08-28T06:34:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"nearing the finish line here. One remaining thing left is honing the java api for span recording. We have an opportunity to make it easier and also match the schema 1-1. That would include the following\r\n\r\n* Change IDs to validated strings\r\n  * This doesn't mean we don't validate.. it is still hex 16 or 32 chars\r\n  * This should be provably more efficient than repeatedly converting back/forth from longs\r\n  * We can tell the difference between an ID that was propagated as 128 bit from one that had all high bits unset (helpful for looking at instrumentation)\r\n  * Storage backends that keep fixed binary or uint64 can continue to (we'd just convert on the way in)\r\n* Change IPs to validated strings\r\n  * this is cheaper than repeatedly doing so and also packing and unpacking InetAddress instances\r\n  * since we don't repeat endpoints anymore, it isn't as necessary to use integer encoding\r\n  * This is a lot easier to read and less to debug than byte arrays or integers\r\n\r\nBy doing the above, the java struct looks exactly like the openapi struct. This makes generated code in any language look just like our native code, which means porting should be easier. This also makes everything easier to troubleshoot, as there are no conversions between types that don't always \"toString\" well.\r\n\r\nBefore, zipkin had to take special attention to reduce memory size as things were repeated a lot. While IDs are definitely longer this way (16 chars is more memory than a long), this seems a reasonable tradeoff. Moreover, if such was a big deal, the instrumentation could make a custom struct easier with v2 than today anyway.\r\n\r\ncc @nicmunroe @anuraaga @shakuzen @jplock @llinder @devinsba ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/325271539/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
