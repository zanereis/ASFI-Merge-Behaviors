The upgrade steps can be amended to not run cloudstack-setup-databases. Instead, shutdown old mgmt server(s), take db backup for cloud, cloud_usage tables, run cloudstack-setup-databases without --deploy-as (i.e. to add a new management server, without deploying a new database), and start new mgmt server.

In fact, I'm even considering, to get rid of this keystore file or symlink to the default system one (at /etc/ssl/certs/java/cacert, with password: `changeit`). The issue I found was that even when I updated the system `cacert` the agent failed to load that, since the old keystore file is used by default. Doing so may require some testing around using custom SSL certs for both SSVM and CPVM. Keeping a separate ca-cert file for cloudstack will cause a pain, when another provider's cert/chain are missing.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/379494931/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/379497194","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/2551#issuecomment-379497194","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/2551","id":379497194,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3OTQ5NzE5NA==","user":{"login":"rafaelweingartner","id":4129005,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjkwMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4129005?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelweingartner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-07T20:31:20Z","updated_at":"2018-04-07T20:31:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I think it is ok to customize the default cacerts with users certificates.
