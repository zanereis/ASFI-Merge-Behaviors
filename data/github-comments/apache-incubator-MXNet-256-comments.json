the generated `mxnet_predict-all.cc` really misses some method definitions, it compiles but fails at runtime, as I added the missed definitions, 3 to 4 missed definitions, I could load the mxnet_predict so on android device successfully.\r\n\r\nAgree with you, amalgamation might be out of dated, and cross platform builds should be better, I will take some time tomorrow to try your dockerfile android arm64 build, hope it will works.\r\n\r\nthanks for your helpful info
