In MySQL all the data is in one place, so however complex the query is, it is first satisfied against all AND clauses and then a limit is applied. With Cassandra, each AND condition may need to be resolved against a different index table, by doing direct shard key lookup. So instead of `(x AND y AND z) % LIMIT`, the Cassandra SpanStore implementation does `(x % LIMIT) AND (y % LIMIT) AND (z % LIMIT)`. The resulting intersection can easily produce < LIMIT results, quite often 0 if you have many AND clauses and LIMIT is small.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/228377921/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/228379568","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/1144#issuecomment-228379568","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1144","id":228379568,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyODM3OTU2OA==","user":{"login":"eirslett","id":1872593,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NzI1OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1872593?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett","html_url":"https://github.com/eirslett","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-24T15:38:50Z","updated_at":"2016-06-24T15:38:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@negatioN interesting for FINN?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/228379568/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/228499320","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1142#issuecomment-228499320","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1142","id":228499320,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyODQ5OTMyMA==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-25T01:23:32Z","updated_at":"2016-06-25T01:23:32Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@yurishkuro You are right to mention the above when multiple conditions exist.

remedy.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/228505017/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/228505119","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1142#issuecomment-228505119","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1142","id":228505119,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyODUwNTExOQ==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-25T03:03:52Z","updated_at":"2016-06-25T03:03:52Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"for

at your metrics output, it seems you aren't running the latest\nversion of zipkin (counter.zipkin_collector.bytes should have read\ncounter.zipkin_collector.bytes.http).\nI don't think this impacts your issue, but it would be less distracting to\nuse the same version of code (latest is 1.1.5).\n\nOne thing that seems odd is that the cumulative bytes collected from\nhttp(157k)  are less than the cumulative bytes collected from kafka (407k).\nAre you using the same encoding for both? the byte count is after any\ndecompression, so I'd expect figures to be similar...\n\nRegardless, if a scenario

This might be hard to track down, but at least the scenario is repeatable.\n\nps I'm offline likely the rest of the day, but might look into this tomorrow.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/228523401/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/228523904","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1141#issuecomment-228523904","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1141","id":228523904,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyODUyMzkwNA==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-25T08:37:09Z","updated_at":"2016-06-25T08:37:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"sure..

But the transport (kafka/http) work is done once the data is fetched via collector. So how is the issue related to kafka batching plus ES storage?\n\nI think http only worked because the test is slower. For example,\nsleeping 100ms in kafka loop also succeeded.\n\nTL;DR; I would recommend the bundling feature to anyone who seems like\nthey are writing tests or instrumentation. It isn't about this issue\nspecifically, more about encouraging supportable practice.\n\nBuffering and bundling spans ends up using\nAsyncSpanConsumer.accept(List...) as it was written to be used. At the\nmoment, the only way to control the count of spans stored at a time by\nzipkin is to change the instrumentation/reporters to send more than\none span per message. I recall a discussion of adding a buffering\nlayer internally to the kafka code, but that didn't go anywhere.\n\nWe've regularly encountered issues with not bundling across different\ntransports and storage backends.. to the point where we changed the\nstandard format to be a list (the storage api was always a list even\nin scala). You spent a lot of time learning that bundling helps a few\nmonths back, but this isn't a c\\* only concern. ElasticSearch was\nwritten with the assumption that storing lists is the common case..\nelse it wouldn't have used Bulk operations in the first place. This is\nthe same thing with MySQL and likely will end up the way for C\\* at\nsome point. We really ought to encourage bundling as a standard\nfeature for reporting spans regardless if the bundle size policy will\nbe transport-specific.\n\nThe other option is to see a practice, like dumping many messages at\nthe same time, and say nothing. That person might go production etc\nassuming span-per-message is fine.. to a point where it is hard to\nchange their instrumentation. Maybe they never considered bundling at\nall. Would they have the experience and time you did to troubleshoot\nand refactor late in deployment? Would someone be available for free\nOSS support for several days? Would folks want to hack zipkin to\nbuffer on behalf of them? Would that debate finish quick enough and\nwith the desired outcome to resolve the issue? Maybe to all, but I'd\nrather raise a flag about a known stick then get smacked with it\nlater.\n\nTruth is, we can't count on volunteers to do free support, design and\ndev work on-demand.. so we have to work in ways that are likely to use\nthe limited time we have to help the highest amount of users. When\nfolks have bundling in mind from the beginning, it can be adjusted\nwhen they get into a support problem, or in their test scenario. They\ncan solve or work around more problems without us.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/228593049/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/228593847","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1141#issuecomment-228593847","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1141","id":228593847,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyODU5Mzg0Nw==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-26T10:11:04Z","updated_at":"2016-06-26T10:11:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"here's
