I saw your last update. Thanks for your prompt response! \nHere is the list of dependencies from `mvn dependency:tree`. All of them will become part of the Zeppelin binary package. What needed to be done is \n- make sure that all these dependencies and the transitive dependencies as well\n- have an appropriate licence, and are logged under the `./zeppelin-distribution/src/bin_license/LICENSE`\n- and for non-Apache license, full text of the license need to be added to `./zeppelin-distribution/src/license/`\n\nFor your convenience I have listed all current dependencies of `scio` module below. You don't need to add all of the licenses listed in here. Many things are already existed. \n\n```\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[INFO] Building Zeppelin: Scio 0.7.0-SNAPSHOT\n[INFO]

And if there is no input from user for more than 2 sec, it stops filtering.\n\nThe reason I implemented filtering myself is to fix the latency issue with large number of notebooks. If you filter on every keydown event, it will freeze browser when you have a lot of notebooks.(tested with 250 notebooks). \n\nWill it be better if I add UI letting user know that they should press return button to complete filtering?\n\n@corneadoug \nactually, I've used the interpreter filtering in the first implementation.\nHowever, the behavior is a bit different from job filtering. So I had to define separate filters.\n\n#### Filtering input and No results\n\nYour opinion is right.\nOkay, I will fix it.\n\n#### Interpreter dropdown filtering\n\nI think this feature is very important.\nbecause currently there is no way to manage your interpreter which are not bound to notebook.\nalso, if you use a lot of notebooks and interpreter, I think users would want to see and sort it.\nPersonally I also wanted to have this kind of view when i was using cron scheduler to operating a notebook then can not find problem for interpreter bind.\nI think this feature is a good way to be feedback to the user.\n\n#### Possible future work that could use a jira issue\n\nYes, I agree with your opinion.\ni will make a jira issue and implement those in future.\n\nThank you again.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/251912016/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/251912102","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1461#issuecomment-251912102","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1461","id":251912102,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MTkxMjEwMg==","user":{"login":"corneadoug","id":710411,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDQxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/710411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug","html_url":"https://github.com/corneadoug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-06T09:29:24Z","updated_at":"2016-10-06T09:29:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Go
