In order to support more k8s features, the `100-interpreter-spec.yaml` file may indeed become more complicated. But if users are required to modify `100-interpreter-spec.yaml`, it may lead to a poor user experience. Especially when the user directly runs the zeppelin server in the k8s cluster, every time the `100-interpreter-spec.yaml` file is modified, the docker image needs to be rebuilt and deployed.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I think that common features should be placed in the `100-interpreter-spec.yaml` file as much as possible so that users can directly configure their desired properties in the interpreter settings. When users need to configure some more customized properties, they can modify the `100-interpreter-spec.yaml` file.\r\n\r\nI think `imagePullpolicy` is a property that users may often need to configure. For example, when users update images with the same tag in the repository, they can set the `imagePullpolicy` to be `Always`.

In order to support more k8s features, the `100-interpreter-spec.yaml` file may indeed become more complicated. But if users are required to modify `100-interpreter-spec.yaml`, it may lead to a poor user experience. Especially when the user directly runs the zeppelin server in the k8s cluster, every time the `100-interpreter-spec.yaml` file is modified, the docker image needs to be rebuilt and deployed.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I think that common features should be placed in the `100-interpreter-spec.yaml` file as much as possible so that users can directly configure their desired properties in the interpreter settings. When users need to configure some more customized properties, they can modify the `100-interpreter-spec.yaml` file.\r\n\r\nUsers may often need to pull the image from a private repository, so I think this property is relatively important.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/878747422/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/878789869","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/4172#issuecomment-878789869","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/4172","id":878789869,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3ODc4OTg2OQ==","user":{"login":"Reamer","id":454320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NDMyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/454320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer","html_url":"https://github.com/Reamer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-13T05:25:01Z","updated_at":"2021-07-13T05:25:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Please

I have fixed the CI failure.\r\nAfter my test, when zeppelin server is also running inside k8s, there'll be a few more problems:\r\n1. the zeppelin server needs to obtain the **cluster role** instead of role to create pods and services in other namespaces.\r\n2. There're 2 namespaces: the namespace of zeppelin server and the namespace of zeppelin interpreter. So the namespace return by method `getNamespace` may be wrong if we return the `zeppelin.k8s.interpreter.namespace` while zeppelin server is also running in k8s.\r\n3. When zeppelin server pod and interpreter pod are in different namespaces, the `ownerReference` can not be set. Since Cross-namespace owner references are disallowed by design <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/garbage-collection/>.\r\n\r\nBut if zeppelin server is running outside k8s, it can correctly create the interpreter pod in different namespaces. There won't be a problem of cross-namespace communication between zeppelin server and interpreter.\r\n\r\nSo how about support the feature of separate namespace while zeppelin server is running in k8s in another PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/880387057/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/880505563","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/4089#issuecomment-880505563","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/4089","id":880505563,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg4MDUwNTU2Mw==","user":{"login":"PrarthiJain","id":46317159,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MzE3MTU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46317159?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrarthiJain","html_url":"https://github.com/PrarthiJain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrarthiJain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrarthiJain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrarthiJain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrarthiJain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrarthiJain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrarthiJain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrarthiJain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrarthiJain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrarthiJain/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-15T08:31:40Z","updated_at":"2021-07-15T08:31:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Reamer @zjffdu @prabhjyotsingh, I have updated the patch.

I understand the problems when Zeppelin server is running in K8s and they are not easy to solve.\r\n> Please add the documentation which explain the flag. Please make it clear that this feature only works when Zeppelin is running outside of K8s.\r\n\r\nHi, @Reamer \r\nThanks for the comment. Due to potential code conflicts, I think it's better to achieve the feature of setting the separate namespace for the interpereter when Zeppelin server is running inside k8s in the PR. \r\n\r\nSo I added several commits to address the above three problems. Specifically,\r\n1. Change `role` and `rolebinding` to `clusterrole` and `clusterrolebinding`\r\n2. Update the conditions for setting `ownerReference`\r\n3. Return the correct namespace of Zeppelin Server\r\n\r\n\r\nHence, it can set the separate namespace for each interpreter no matter Zeppelin server is running inside k8s or not.\r\n\r\nFor example, user can start a spark interpreter in the namespace of `spark`:\r\n<img width=\"1403\" alt=\"截屏2021-07-21 下午5 05 45\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38122586/126467521-975c35b0-d0fa-43c3-b7d9-7ef548752d6e.png\">\r\n<img width=\"866\" alt=\"截屏2021-07-21 下午5 39 38\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38122586/126467929-6c7fc835-1e68-4d5a-ac95-f6483f5b4bb3.png\">\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, user can start a shell interpreter in the namespace of `sh`:\r\n<img width=\"1419\" alt=\"截屏2021-07-21 下午5 02 55\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38122586/126468069-162d588a-f43a-4f01-9cd3-1d0aa35bdc37.png\">\r\n<img width=\"345\" alt=\"截屏2021-07-21 下午5 03 04\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38122586/126468113-35c1214d-dfa4-4514-854a-6b5e888f63ec.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/884048032/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/884218933","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/4127#issuecomment-884218933","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/4127","id":884218933,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAfU5DM40tBw1","user":{"login":"Reamer","id":454320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NDMyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/454320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer","html_url":"https://github.com/Reamer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-21T14:07:44Z","updated_at":"2021-07-21T14:07:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @nilroy\r\nI hope to have time to fix this.
