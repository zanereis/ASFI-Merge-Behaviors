@RaigorJiang I'm working on [quarkus-shardingsphere-jdbc](https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-shardingsphere-jdbc) and Quarkus also has the depdency on `org.antlr4:antlr4-runtime` with `4.9.2`. So I get the following message\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> ANTLR Tool version 4.7.2 used for code generation does not match the current runtime version 4.9.2\r\n> ANTLR Runtime version 4.7.2 used for parser compilation does not match the current runtime version 4.9.2\r\n> ANTLR Tool version 4.7.2 used for code generation does not match the current runtime version 4.9.2\r\n> ANTLR Runtime version 4.7.2 used for parser compilation does not match the current runtime version 4.9.2\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> Anyway, I could align the antlr4 version in `quarkus-shardingsphere-jdbc` with `shardingshpere-jdbc-core`.
