I totally agree with your thought process on retrying tests only when it makes sense but for now we have unstable CI and it's such a pain for contributor to submit a PR then wait for results and if any tests fail then verify it locally (which most of the times it works). This is an attempt to reduce that pain. I totally understand that it might not help or resolve this issue but i can try :)\r\n> \r\n> Hence i have not yet published this PR, first let me try this CI couple of times and if i have enough confidence on this that it's giving positive results then i can submit it for review :) BTW jFYI i have also picked up few top failing UTs and trying dig deeper to understand fundamental cause of failure so i will continue that effort in parallel to this patch fixes. Let me know if that makes sense.\r\n\r\nI guess it makes sense because if the test fails today, people are just manually retrying. So it helps to avoid that part of human toils. Given that saying, one thing I belive is necessary is to count the retried tests as unstable tests as well. We don't want to lost track of unstable test signal, even we want to make people's life easier.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/1416378878/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/1416594327","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/helix/pull/2368#issuecomment-1416594327","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2368","id":1416594327,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAPIHxc5Ub4OX","user":{"login":"rahulrane50","id":23309709,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMzA5NzA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23309709?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulrane50","html_url":"https://github.com/rahulrane50","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulrane50/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulrane50/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulrane50/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulrane50/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulrane50/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulrane50/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulrane50/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulrane50/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulrane50/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-04T01:36:41Z","updated_at":"2023-02-04T01:36:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@junkaixue
