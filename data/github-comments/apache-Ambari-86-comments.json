Do you have a good solution\r\n\r\nSame here - I've spent hours over the past few days getting Ambari to compile and install on Ubuntu 18.04. This morning I finally had it working, but I immediately ran into this problem with no available versions in the wizard.  \r\n\r\nThis PR acknowledges the problem that HDP repos are no longer an option since Hortonworks does not exist anymore, but only fixes the Ambari build problems.\r\n\r\n@NISHANTSHRIVASTAV has repeatedly and clearly asked the question here: how do we get repositories for Hadoop, Hbase, Solr, Kafka etc so that they can be made available in the Ambari Cluster creation wizard?\r\n\r\nI don't mind if it involves work on my part, but it is beyond my current knowledge, I would need some documentation on how to achieve this.\r\n\r\nCurrently it seems that Ambari is not a viable product? I'm really interested in getting a fully open source cluster operational but that would have to include a management piece like Ambari.\r\n\r\nSo, to repeat @NISHANTSHRIVASTAV's question, has anyone out there built an operational Ambari recently with repositories for HBase, Hadoop, Kafka etc that can be made to appear in the 'select version' section of the Wizard, and is there documentation on how to do this? If not, of what use now is Ambari? Not trying to be confrontational, I really want to use Ambari, but it seems not possible without having way more knowledge than I currently possess on setting up repositories etc.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/issues/comments/897655121/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/issues/comments/899758478","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ambari/pull/3139#issuecomment-899758478","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/issues/3139","id":899758478,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACVE2c41oTmO","user":{"login":"sziszo","id":3410619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTA2MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3410619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sziszo","html_url":"https://github.com/sziszo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sziszo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sziszo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sziszo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sziszo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sziszo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sziszo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sziszo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sziszo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sziszo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-16T19:20:13Z","updated_at":"2021-08-16T19:20:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"retest
