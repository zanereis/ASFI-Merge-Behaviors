I am not using HBase at this moment... if you cannot I will pull the source for HBase and try it out. \r\n\r\n@nishadi I've looked at the PR and it looks good to me, however I wonder if there is a small test we could include for the [HBaseStore#readMapping](https://github.com/apache/gora/blob/master/gora-hbase/src/main/java/org/apache/gora/hbase/store/HBaseStore.java#L730) which would allow us to verify the behavior? Well annotated unit tests, specifically on individual datastores are very useful for datastore-specific behaviour. \r\nThank you for the PR, this is great.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gora/issues/comments/304434391/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gora/issues/comments/304434416","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gora/pull/103#issuecomment-304434416","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gora/issues/103","id":304434416,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNDQzNDQxNg==","user":{"login":"djkevincr","id":1346010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDYwMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1346010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/djkevincr","html_url":"https://github.com/djkevincr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djkevincr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djkevincr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djkevincr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djkevincr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djkevincr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djkevincr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djkevincr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djkevincr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djkevincr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-27T07:20:03Z","updated_at":"2017-05-27T07:20:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"+1 for merge to master, will let others to review.

Quick question, I saw that you have created a CassandraNativePersistent which implements Persistent, so for the Avro serialization will use the same right? So How is this going to play with the Gora Compiler? Will we have to modify that as well? Couldn't we just use the Persistent class? :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gora/issues/comments/314003769/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gora/issues/comments/314491323","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gora/pull/110#issuecomment-314491323","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gora/issues/110","id":314491323,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNDQ5MTMyMw==","user":{"login":"madhawa-gunasekara","id":6748599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NDg1OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6748599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/madhawa-gunasekara","html_url":"https://github.com/madhawa-gunasekara","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madhawa-gunasekara/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madhawa-gunasekara/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madhawa-gunasekara/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madhawa-gunasekara/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madhawa-gunasekara/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madhawa-gunasekara/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madhawa-gunasekara/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madhawa-gunasekara/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madhawa-gunasekara/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-11T16:00:39Z","updated_at":"2017-07-11T16:00:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi @renato2099 \r\n\r\nThanks for the comments. I'm using Persistent Class for the avro serialization :) because there are some limitations in the Cassandra native serializations, like compound keys, composite keys don't support in native serialization [https://datastax-oss.atlassian.net/browse/JAVA-904](1) therefore, I'm going support that using avro serialization by doing the mapping manually. I'm not using Cassandra Native Persistent for avro, It's only for native serialization.

My guess would be (1) using a slower machine before which would make the deletes come after the inserts, but with a faster machine they could be swapped (we are also using the same writer btw) (2) Multi-threaded Hbase client? I think this came later than our previous releases, but I don't know if the client we are using is actually multithreaded or not. Maybe another thing to try would be [limiting HBase client](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42919819/hbase-multithreading-client-performance) to see what happens by reducing the connection pool.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gora/issues/comments/315627156/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gora/issues/comments/318442490","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gora/pull/111#issuecomment-318442490","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gora/issues/111","id":318442490,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxODQ0MjQ5MA==","user":{"login":"djkevincr","id":1346010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDYwMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1346010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/djkevincr","html_url":"https://github.com/djkevincr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djkevincr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djkevincr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djkevincr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djkevincr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djkevincr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djkevincr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djkevincr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djkevincr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djkevincr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-27T18:11:30Z","updated_at":"2017-07-27T18:11:30Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Build passes without any issue.\r\n\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Reactor Summary:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Apache Gora .......................................
