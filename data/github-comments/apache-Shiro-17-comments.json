If you'd rather skip all updates until the next major or minor version, let me know by commenting `@dependabot ignore this major version` or `@dependabot ignore this minor version`. You can also ignore all major, minor, or patch releases for a dependency by adding an [`ignore`

have a couple options to make injections work:\r\n* make your realm an `@ApplicationScoped @Named` bean and reference it from shiro.ini, as documented above.\r\n* Use OmniFaces' `Beans.getReference(...)` to `@Inject` your bean programmatically (will also work with Shiro 1.x) (see
