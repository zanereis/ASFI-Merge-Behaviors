That is to say, a connection is **open** unless it was closed explicitly.\n\nNow the problem is, since `Thrift` hides the underlying `TSocket`, unless using some tricks, I can't acces to the `socket` object from downstream application (say [happybase](https://github.com/wbolster/happybase) in this case) to determine whether it should be closed. Then it becomes so easy for a normal user to create more and more connections until reaching the system limit.\n\nSo I hope `TTransport` could add an method calls something like `shouldClose` or `isDropped`, inside which, using something like `select([sock], [], [], 0.0)` to determine whether this socket should be closed.  **Or** simply expose the `TSocket` object to the outer world. \n\nFYI, according to http://code.activestate.com/recipes/408997-when-to-not-just-use-socketclose/#c5 :\n\n> Now, that incoming socket, which `select` just said was readable, has no data waiting. According to asyncore, twisted, and every other asynchronous package I've seen, when a socket is readable(), but has no data waiting, then the remote machine has disconnected.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/196004421/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/196013077","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/945#issuecomment-196013077","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/945","id":196013077,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5NjAxMzA3Nw==","user":{"login":"nsuke","id":3064114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjQxMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3064114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsuke","html_url":"https://github.com/nsuke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsuke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsuke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsuke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsuke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsuke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsuke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsuke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsuke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsuke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-13T18:00:44Z","updated_at":"2016-03-13T18:00:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> I agree to obey the literal meaning of isOpen\n\nTo be clear, I'm not against introducing the feature you're suggesting, I've just commented on the approach.\nIn fact, as you may have noticed, C++ has peek() method that does \"somewhat\" similar thing.\n\n> FYI, according to http://code.activestate.com/recipes/408997-when-to-not-just-use-socketclose/#c5 :\n\nIt's same as the cases where read() returns 0 length, i.e. just plain old EOF, so you still need to check the available data.\nThe urllib3 code you took is assuming that any remaining data is invalid (it's true in their context).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/196013077/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/196151889","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/945#issuecomment-196151889","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/945","id":196151889,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5NjE1MTg4OQ==","user":{"login":"cherrot","id":964629,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NDYyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/964629?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cherrot","html_url":"https://github.com/cherrot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cherrot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cherrot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cherrot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cherrot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cherrot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cherrot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cherrot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cherrot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cherrot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-14T05:37:51Z","updated_at":"2016-03-14T05:37:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for reminding me that @nsuke ;)\nI'll commit & push a new implementation like the `peek()` method in C++ lib. \n\nBTW do we need preserve the function name `peek` ?

happybase does not seem to bother with transport state at all; by isOpen it only avoids \"already opened\" exceptions.\n\nAs what I described in [happybase issue#112](https://github.com/wbolster/happybase/issues/112), happybase use `isOpen` (after all there is no other method to do so) to check if it need to reopen the connection in its connection pool implementation. (See [pool.py](https://github.com/wbolster/happybase/blob/9cbd718c10a3089f234f1eac1236b631e1f8e7cd/happybase/pool.py#L135-L138) and [connection.py](https://github.com/wbolster/happybase/blob/9cbd718c10a3089f234f1eac1236b631e1f8e7cd/happybase/connection.py#L164-L170)). However in this use case, `isOpen` always returns True.\n\nConsider the following case: suppose Thrift server would drop a connection which was idle for **2min**, and the client side communicates with Thrift server **every 1 to 5min**. With the current implementation the client side would encounter extremely frequent network failures.\n\n> Note that almighty \"this connection is fine\" guarantee is very costly: even the current patch does not cover cases like invalidated file descriptor (i.e. closed socket) and half closed non-writable sockets.\n\nCompared with the former case, this patch is quite efficient (no underlying network communication, no blocking).\n\nAnd I don't think it breaks the KISS rule. At least you don't need to put your failover code everywhere.\n\nOf course we cannot cover all the circumstances of a connection's possible state, but we can try our best to give a probably healthy connection for the moment. For other circumstances, it depends on the user's decision (to let it die or have a retry logic).\n\nAfter all, what this patch does is providing a convenient way to test the connection.  It never forces developers to use this in their application or libs.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/198018473/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/198399248","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/952#issuecomment-198399248","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/952","id":198399248,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5ODM5OTI0OA==","user":{"login":"nsuke","id":3064114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjQxMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3064114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsuke","html_url":"https://github.com/nsuke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsuke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsuke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsuke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsuke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsuke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsuke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsuke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsuke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsuke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-18T15:02:23Z","updated_at":"2016-03-18T15:02:23Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@tylertreat-wf

happybase use isOpen (after all there is no other method to do so) to check if it need to reopen the connection\n\nisOpen call seems to be for only lazy initialization but it might not the point we

block](https://github.com/wbolster/happybase/blob/9cbd718c10a3089f234f1eac1236b631e1f8e7cd/happybase/pool.py#L141) I have impression that they may like your contribution.\n\nIf happybase's pool needs something similar to urllib3's pool, it's perfectly possible without modifying Thrift: just store TSocket instance and use its `handle` attribute.\nThat way, the validation can be much simpler (and yet more complete) than this, because you can make a lot of assumptions which are specific to your use
