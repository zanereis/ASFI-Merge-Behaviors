Rewriting code in setup.py is quote fragile. For instance it is not clear if it works at all for binary distributions for which apache_beam/**init**.py may not exist as a plain file. Better avoid this headache. I would be happier with having the XML parsing code (using regex) duplicated in a file (version.py or even **init**.py) and have a get_version() function. \n\nFor the sake of making progress with this CL you can just leave a TODO in the setup.py that we want to move in this direction. Having a unified Maven based system is a very good achievement and I would rather not block this any longer.\nThanks!\nSilviu\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/230835843/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/230841463","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/585#issuecomment-230841463","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/585","id":230841463,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMDg0MTQ2Mw==","user":{"login":"lukecwik","id":10078956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDc4OTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10078956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik","html_url":"https://github.com/lukecwik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-06T17:16:19Z","updated_at":"2016-07-06T17:16:19Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"LGTM\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/230841463/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/230842014","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/585#issuecomment-230842014","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/585","id":230842014,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMDg0MjAxNA==","user":{"login":"jbonofre","id":158903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODkwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/158903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre","html_url":"https://github.com/jbonofre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-06T17:18:21Z","updated_at":"2016-07-06T17:18:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"LGTM\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/230842014/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/230843304","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/590#issuecomment-230843304","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/590","id":230843304,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMDg0MzMwNA==","user":{"login":"ianzhou1","id":6316453,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTY0NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6316453?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianzhou1","html_url":"https://github.com/ianzhou1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianzhou1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianzhou1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianzhou1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianzhou1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianzhou1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianzhou1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianzhou1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianzhou1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianzhou1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-06T17:22:39Z","updated_at":"2016-07-06T17:22:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"lgtm\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/230843304/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/be

Jenkins configuration configuration is not part of the source tree. @dhalperi may help you with setting that up.

(Having it installed in the Travis config is fine because, there is no user path for installing the sdk through Travis.)\n\nThis change is LGTM as longs as all tests become green (either by updating

Maven lifecycle is pretty cool!\n\nJenkins is still failing:\n\n```\nCaused by: java.io.IOException: Cannot run program \"tox\" (in directory \"/home/jenkins/jenkins-slave/workspace/beam_PreCommit_MavenVerify/sdks/python\"): error=2, No such file or directory\n    at java.lang.ProcessBuilder.start(ProcessBuilder.java:1048)\n    at java.lang.Runtime.exec(Runtime.java:620)\n    at org.apache.commons.exec.launcher.Java13CommandLauncher.exec(Java13CommandLauncher.java:61)\n```\n\nI added a comment in the `pom.xml` why this is happening, but I have to do some research to understand the best solution.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/231284532/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/231287484","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/1#issuecomment-231287484","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/1","id":231287484,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMTI4NzQ4NA==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-08T06:45:38Z","updated_at":"2016-07-08T06:45:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[![Coverage

It isn't really about enabling/disabling runners.\n\nSo it is the build _without_ this new profile that is accurately configured. Hence there is a use case for surgically adding runners to the classpath (via the standard dependency mechanisms) but not for surgically removing them; the latter assumes a configuration that is somewhat erroneous by default.\n\nIt would actually be pretty ideal to have a profile activation that was specifically \"interactive command line use\" but I don't know if there is a clever way to

Neville,\n\nIan had some in-flight changes to add streaming write support and display data, which were needed pre-0.9 as well. Would you mind re-basing this on master and making some minor fixups? This will have the advantage of restarting the jenkins build as well.\n\nAdditionally, there are a few places where Javadoc needs to be fixed up. At L126 there is still a reference to `ClusterId` (GitHub won't let me comment unless it's near a diff).\n\nIt would also be good if you could review users of the word cluster in all these files and see if they should be changed to instance.\n\nThanks!\nDan\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/231427348/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
