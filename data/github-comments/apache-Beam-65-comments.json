So it doesn't make sense for `ApexRunner` to depend on specific versions of `com.datatorrent:netlet`, `commons-io`, or `hadoop-common`.\r\n\r\nBut the runner itself, just by linking to particular classes and methods, should at least have a version _range_ for these dependencies that includes those APIs actually referenced. The transitive dependency should presumably fall within that range, but it should work with all compatible transitive deps. Is this not the case?\r\n\r\nI don't think we should have compile-time references to classes and methods without declared dependencies except in very special circumstances.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/262443935/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/262444343","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/1374#issuecomment-262444343","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/1374","id":262444343,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MjQ0NDM0Mw==","user":{"login":"jbonofre","id":158903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODkwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/158903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre","html_url":"https://github.com/jbonofre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-23T06:48:25Z","updated_at":"2016-11-23T06:48:25Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Updated according to the last comment.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/262444343/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/262454830","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/1397#issuecomment-262454830","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/1397","id":262454830,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MjQ1NDgzMA==","user":{"login":"tenghuanhe","id":6974870,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NzQ4NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6974870?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tenghuanhe","html_url":"https://github.com/tenghuanhe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tenghuanhe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tenghuanhe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tenghuanhe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tenghuanhe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tenghuanhe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tenghuanhe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tenghuanhe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tenghuanhe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tenghuanhe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-23T08:17:28Z","updated_at":"2016-11-23T12:25:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Many thanks for your review @davorbonaci, @peihe \r\n\r\nSorry for not considering that this fix may work only for the local file system.\r\n\r\nAs @peihe pointed out, when `IOChannelFactory.remove()` can support recursively delete, the workaround `IOChannelFactory.resolve(tempDir, \"*\")` can be bypassed, which calls `java.nio.file.Path.resolve(tempDir, \"*\")` and throws Exception on Windows, so this workaround workaround fix can also be bypassed.\r\n\r\nAnd a little advice,  maybe we should avoid the usage that may lead to incompatibility across different systems like \"*\" as a file path wildcard in the SDK code.\r\n\r\nI have read https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-1041, great and detailed issue description and I am very happy to help address it.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I have found this https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-59 and https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-951.\r\nAnd BEAM-1041 can be a subtask of BEAM-951 and a sub-subtask of BEAM-59, is that right?\r\n\r\n `IOChannelFactory` now has implementation `FileIOChannelFactory` for local files, and `GcsIOChannelFactory` for Google Cloud Storage, is HDFS and S3 implementation on the way? and Is `HDFSFileSink` going to use `HdfsIOChannelFactory` if there is one in the future (I found now it directly uses HDFS File APIs)?\r\n\r\n@peihe Could you please explain these questions?

Let me know what you think. All comments are very welcome, and I'll incorporate all your suggestions as best I can.\r\n\r\nThings that need special review:\r\n* `MetricName`, `MetricKey`, `MetricResult` are simple `namedtuple`s without any validation. Should we leave them be this way?\r\n*  `MetricsEnvironment` is used as a 'global' object that keeps global state. Its methods are a bit python-awkward (e.g. `set_metrics_supported`, `set_current_container`, `unset_current_container`). Should we rename/refactor them? The `@property` decorator doesn't work for class methods.\r\n* `MetricsContainer` has the `get_Counter`, and `get_Distribution` methods. Should we rename them to `counter` and `distribution`?\r\n* `MetricsAggregation` seemed a bit unnatural in `DirectMetrics`, so I moved it to the `cells.py` file. Should we also separate them in Java? (or should I move them to `DirectMetrics` in Python?)\r\n* The class `MetricUpdate` does not exist. Instead, a metric update is of the basic data value of the metrics (e.g. `DistributionData`, or `int`). Does this seem fine?\r\n* Is the documentation good enough? : )\r\n\r\nI'll add more unit tests next week, to be sure that the code is safe and sound.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/262650660/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/262651291","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/1397#issuecomment-262651291","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/1397","id":262651291,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MjY1MTI5MQ==","user":{"login":"peihe","id":10201797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjAxNzk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10201797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peihe","html_url":"https://github.com/peihe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peihe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peihe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peihe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peihe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peihe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peihe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peihe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peihe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peihe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-23T23:03:31Z","updated_at":"2016-11-23T23:03:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tenghuanhe\r\n\r\nI marked BEAM-1041 as a sub-task of BEAM-59.\r\n\r\nThanks for bringing up the Windows OS compatibility issues.
