Of course it's up to you to decide when to merged the pull request. :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/136816440/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/136820427","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/92#issuecomment-136820427","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/92","id":136820427,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNjgyMDQyNw==","user":{"login":"PascalSchumacher","id":2707245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDcyNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2707245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher","html_url":"https://github.com/PascalSchumacher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-01T18:27:20Z","updated_at":"2015-09-01T18:27:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks! :+1: \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/136820427/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/136821595","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/94#issuecomment-136821595","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/94","id":136821595,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNjgyMTU5NQ==","user":{"login":"keeganwitt","id":64612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NjEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keeganwitt","html_url":"https://github.com/keeganwitt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keeganwitt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keeganwitt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keeganwitt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keeganwitt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keeganwitt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keeganwitt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keeganwitt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keeganwitt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keeganwitt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-01T18:32:45Z","updated_at":"2015-09-01T18:32:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yeah, I reckon so.

Pascal asked for a review, I would say: It would be nice to have regression tests for: \n- invoking closeWithWarning() with closeable closes closeable\n- invoking closeWithWarning() with null does not fail\n- invoking closeWithWarning() with closeable that throws Exception on close() does not throw Exception\n- invoking withAutoCloseable() closes even when action throws exception\n- invoking withAutoCloseable() closes even when action throws exception e1, and e1 is thrown even when close() throws another exception e2.\n\nThe code could have a brief comment explaining the strategy of wrapping the call to close in case the call to self action fails, so that the first Exception is not swallowed by the second.\n\nAlso withAutoCloseable is vulnerable to invoking with null, will throw NPE.

Eg\n\nFile getParentFile() ----> skipped\n(String|Path) getParent() ----> serialized to [parent='/some/path/']\n\nThus no loss of information/ no recursive references to File object.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/138589688/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/138590332","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/105#issuecomment-138590332","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/105","id":138590332,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzODU5MDMzMg==","user":{"login":"eginez","id":175813,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTgxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/175813?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eginez","html_url":"https://github.com/eginez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eginez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eginez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eginez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eginez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eginez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eginez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eginez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eginez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eginez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-08T14:50:22Z","updated_at":"2015-09-08T14:50:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Made a mistake in previous comment, the JDK7 does not use Path as the return type of the methods, it uses String.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/138590332/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/138591323","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/105#issuecomment-138591323","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/105","id":138591323,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzODU5MTMyMw==","user":{"login":"graemerocher","id":66626,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NjI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66626?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/graemerocher","html_url":"https://github.com/graemerocher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graemerocher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graemerocher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graemerocher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graemerocher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graemerocher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graemerocher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graemerocher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graemerocher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graemerocher/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-08T14:53:57Z","updated_at":"2015-09-08T14:53:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"One comment I would make regarding this, if we start adding `isAssignableFrom` checks for every possible type then the performance is going to start to suffer.

ranges are already kind-of supported in Groovy. Ranges are defined by the \"next()\" method on the instances, which for 0.1..10 yields [0.1, 0.2, 0.3 ...]\nRanges can either be inspired by for-loops (having an increment step), or by mathematic intervals. Given Guava has ranges as you point out, I am not sure if Groovy should go out of its way to implement the same thing. \n\nChanging the grammar so that the parse can parse a larger variety of ranges should not be that difficult technically, but you may face resistance from language designers. Changing the code for the ranges an be a bit challenging, in particular since you must not break existing usages.\n\nI am not sure if you are volunteering to work on this, or asking for this to be done.

They will do so just fine, since Java will do the boxing, but an old library will not work with these new Ranges\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/141349082/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/141354627","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/120#issuecomment-141354627","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/120","id":141354627,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MTM1NDYyNw==","user":{"login":"l0rinc","id":1841944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDE5NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1841944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0rinc","html_url":"https://github.com/l0rinc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0rinc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0rinc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0rinc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0rinc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0rinc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0rinc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0rinc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0rinc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0rinc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-18T06:11:26Z","updated_at":"2015-09-18T08:41:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hello @blackdrag,\n\n1) I will document it, if you think it's necessary, though I think it was already specified that it returned an empty list - and not that it returned a new list.\nAlso, why would people modify a list, returned by an empty range?\n\n2) You're right, I will add a delegate method (deprecating it would be weird, as `int` is probably the most common usage).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/141354627/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/141413800","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/120#issuecomment-141413800","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/120","id":141413800,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MTQxMzgwMA==","user":{"login":"blackdrag","id":470278,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MDI3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/470278?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag","html_url":"https://github.com/blackdrag","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-18T10:31:31Z","updated_at":"2015-09-18T10:31:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"An empty list can still be a list that gets elements added.
