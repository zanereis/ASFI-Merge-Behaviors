Keep posting questions directly in ML for quicker response.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in the Mailing List:\r\nThe configuration setup depends on which mechanism you use w.r.t Spark :\r\n1. For Spark DataSource route, you can use the \"options\" API of DataFrameWriter to pass in these configs. Here is an example from http://hudi.apache.org/incremental_processing.html\r\ninputDF.write()\r\n      .format(\"com.uber.hoodie\")\r\n      .options(clientOpts) // any of the Hudi client opts can be passed in as well\r\n      .option(DataSourceWriteOptions.RECORDKEY_FIELD_OPT_KEY(), \"_row_key\")\r\n      .option(DataSourceWriteOptions.PARTITIONPATH_FIELD_OPT_KEY(), \"partition\")\r\n      .option(DataSourceWriteOptions.PRECOMBINE_FIELD_OPT_KEY(), \"timestamp\")\r\n      .option(HoodieWriteConfig.TABLE_NAME, tableName)\r\n      .mode(SaveMode.Append)\r\n      .save(basePath);\r\n2. For an approach involving using HoodieWriteClient directly, you can simply construct HoodieWriteConfig object with the configs in the link you mentioned.\r\n3. When using HoodieDeltaStreamer tool to ingest, you can set the configs in properties file and pass the file as the cmdline argument \"--props\"\r\n\r\nAll the file-size configs must be in bytes denomination\r\n\r\nRegarding your general question about making compaction work with DeltaStreamer, enabling inline compaction is the best option (setting hoodie.compact.inline=true). With this enabled, compaction will run after every ingestion. To reduce the frequency, set hoodie.compact.inline.max.delta.commits to a value greater than 1. \r\n\r\nWe will enable inline compaction as default for delta-streamer for MOR cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/470622452/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/470662204","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/596#issuecomment-470662204","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/596","id":470662204,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MDY2MjIwNA==","user":{"login":"rahuledavalath","id":35100135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MTAwMTM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35100135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahuledavalath","html_url":"https://github.com/rahuledavalath","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahuledavalath/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahuledavalath/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahuledavalath/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahuledavalath/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahuledavalath/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahuledavalath/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahuledavalath/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahuledavalath/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahuledavalath/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-07T19:30:59Z","updated_at":"2019-03-07T19:30:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@n3nash @vinothchandar @bvaradar Thanks all for your valuable response.

: \r\n\r\nThe run_hive_sync tool failed because there were multiple standalone jdbc jars found in your hive installation. We have not seen this case in our installations. I have created a PR (https://github.com/apache/incubator-hudi/pull/609) to handle this case. Can you please apply this patch, try this out and let us know if this solved the issue.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nBalaji.V","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/475294724/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/475317483","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/143#issuecomment-475317483","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/143","id":475317483,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NTMxNzQ4Mw==","user":{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-21T17:03:10Z","updated_at":"2019-03-21T17:03:10Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@Zhujun-Vungle Done..
