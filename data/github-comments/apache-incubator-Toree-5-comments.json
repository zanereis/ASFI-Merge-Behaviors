The plugin system was meant to accrue more event types to support varying cases. It seems like having a post run cell event to compliment the pre run cell event would make sense.\r\n\r\nI'm starting to think we should have a common object to store the event names to make it less likely to mis-type the event. Something like...\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nobject PluginEvents {\r\n  /** Signalled when all interpreters have been initialized. */\r\n  val AllInterpretersReady: String = \"allInterpretersReady\"\r\n\r\n  /** Signalled before executing a block of code. */\r\n  val PreRunCell: String = \"preRunCell\"\r\n\r\n  /** Signalled after executing a block of code. */\r\n  val PostRunCell: String = \"postRunCell\"\r\n}\r\n``` ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-toree/issues/comments/273359179/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-toree/issues/comments/273359647","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-toree/pull/86#issuecomment-273359647","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-toree/issues/86","id":273359647,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MzM1OTY0Nw==","user":{"login":"mariusvniekerk","id":73973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczOTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariusvniekerk","html_url":"https://github.com/mariusvniekerk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariusvniekerk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariusvniekerk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariusvniekerk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariusvniekerk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariusvniekerk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariusvniekerk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariusvniekerk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariusvniekerk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariusvniekerk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-18T01:54:08Z","updated_at":"2017-01-18T01:54:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Yeah that seems like a good idea.
