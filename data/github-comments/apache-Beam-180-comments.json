In terms of naming, all values are OutputValue, even the main one--could we call this TaggedOutput instead. Thus one would write, e.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef process(element):\r\n    yield element + 1 # main\r\n    yield TaggedOutput(element + 2) # non-main\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/295835673/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/295844360","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/2612#issuecomment-295844360","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/2612","id":295844360,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NTg0NDM2MA==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-20T18:22:42Z","updated_at":"2017-04-20T18:22:42Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\n[![Coverage

Is this a convenience\nwrapper or an opaque transform? Hiding information like this avoids the\nnatural composability, forcing one to manually implement a cross product.\nInstead one can see it as a feature that features added to CombineGlobally\nare automatically available to Count.globally().\n\nThe third alternative is to introduce an interface which Combine.Globally\nimplements, but has all these \"global combine-y\" methods. The declared\nreturn type would be this interface, the actual returned object would be a\nCombine.Globally.\n\nThe only option that really doesn't makes sense is \"with side inputs.\"\nTechnically, I think side inputs could be bond to the [Proto]CombineFn to\nget a CombineFn rather than being attached when constructing the operation\n(and similarly for DoFns) which solves the issue that the set (if any) of\nvalid side inputs is a property of the Fn not the Transform, but that's a\nmuch more invasive API.\n\nPerhaps this should be taken to the list?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/295872967/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/295883808","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/2608#issuecomment-295883808","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/2608","id":295883808,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NTg4MzgwOA==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-20T20:01:46Z","updated_at":"2017-04-20T20:01:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\n[![Coverage

updated the PR, PTAL.\r\n\r\nThis changes moves the copying piece to the root pom.xml. At root level these two files needed for Python packaging (LICENSE and NOTICE) pushed down to the right folder.\r\n\r\nOne may ask, why are we not packaging python at root instead of pushing down these files. The reason is we need to execute `setup.py` for packaging. The resulting package could only contain files that exist in the same sub-directory tree as the location of `setup.py`. And building the python package at root would require copying the whole `sdks/python` path to root.\r\n\r\nAnother question would be, what happens if `mvn` is invoked directly as `sdks/python` directory. In this case, packaging will succeed however resulting artifacts would not have the necessary files. This should not be a problem since our release procedure requires running `mvn` at root for packaging all needed artifacts.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/295991193/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/296001513","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/2621#issuecomment-296001513","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/2621","id":296001513,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NjAwMTUxMw==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-21T01:21:38Z","updated_at":"2017-04-21T01:21:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\n[![Coverage
