guys.\n\nWould be really nice to test it ASAP so we avoid another rebase.\n\nMost of the changes are purely structural, I tried my best to keep the behaviour as it is. If you look at the wrappers, they have the same content that the methods had when inside the LibvirtComputingResource. Are there changes in the behaviour? Yes, a few. For example, in few methods we had try/catch blocks with e.printStackTrace() and after that still returning true (as a successful operation). There were also methods returning always true and that return was being ignored. Those kind of things I changed.\n\nRight now I'm busy getting my KVM environment test up and running. I will test the changes with OVS and VLAN and send a report to the list. My plan is to do it today/tomorrow\n\nAfter the code reaches master, I will change the flyweight implementation in order to use the Annotations (suggested by @mlsorensen) and also increase UT coverage.\n\nIf you would have time to test it this week it would be very appreciated.\n\nCheers,\nWilder\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/99761689/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/99785209","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/235#issuecomment-99785209","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/235","id":99785209,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk5Nzg1MjA5","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-07T09:06:01Z","updated_at":"2015-05-07T09:06:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[cloudstack-pull-requests
