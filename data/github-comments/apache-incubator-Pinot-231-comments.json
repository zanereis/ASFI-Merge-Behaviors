Do we allow disabling forward index for consuming segment? Can we add a test to verify if it works?\r\n\r\nWith the change in this current PR no we won't allow disabling forward index for consuming segment as it will fail on table creation. The `columnMajorSegmentBuilderEnabled` is set to true by default in the previous [PR](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/12770). And in fact, columnar segment generation won't work with consuming segment whose column has forward index disabled. Even without adding the validation check, the columnar segment generation would still fail (check [this line of code](https://github.com/apache/pinot/blob/master/pinot-segment-local/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/segment/local/segment/readers/PinotSegmentColumnReader.java#L48)).

What we want to be sure is that the memory is released at least once and I think removing synchronization would be enough. But I think the volatile attribute will be fairly cheap (assuming no false sharing issue) so we can set is as volatile to be 100% sure.\r\n\r\nIn fact in DirectMemory it was already volatile.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2046628265/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2046641801","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/12856#issuecomment-2046641801","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/12856","id":2046641801,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c55_UaJ","user":{"login":"shounakmk219","id":25409127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NDA5MTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25409127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shounakmk219","html_url":"https://github.com/shounakmk219","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shounakmk219/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shounakmk219/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shounakmk219/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shounakmk219/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shounakmk219/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shounakmk219/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shounakmk219/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shounakmk219/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shounakmk219/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-10T06:43:05Z","updated_at":"2024-04-10T06:43:05Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"> > It also replaces *? with * for custom metric rules as the surrounding pattern matching is well defined.\r\n> \r\n> Can you please elaborate more on this?

Maybe you can use an example to explain why it is needed?\r\n> \r\n> @zhtaoxiang As @Jackie-Jiang pointed out in point 3 [here](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/12739#discussion_r1554045076), Let's say a metric is of the format `somePrefix.tableName.someMetric` Case 1 using `*?` : pattern = `somePrefix\\\\.([^.]*?)\\\\.someMetric` The parser will do conservative iterations of\r\n> \r\n> 1 . `somePrefix.t` -> fails as `.` is not encountered after it 2 . `somePrefix.ta` -> fails as `.` is not encountered after it . . n . `somePrefix.tableName` -> success as `.` is encountered after it\r\n> \r\n> Case 1 using `*` : pattern = `somePrefix\\\\.([^.]*)\\\\.someMetric` The parser will match `somePrefix.tableName` in the first iteration itself as its greedy and only breaks at the `.` in `.someMetric`\r\n\r\nI get the log for `*?`. For Case 1 using `*`, if it's greedy, I feel `*` should match `tableName.someMetric` first, then `tableName.someMetri`, then `tableName.someMetr`.\r\n\r\nIf my understanding is correct, isn't greedy matching slower? Because in most cases, the suffix will be much longer than the prefix, so greedy is slower. For example, if the pattern is `somePrefix\\\\.([^.]*?)\\\\.someMetric\\\\.suffix1\\\\.suffix2\\\\.suffix3`, and the metric is `somePrefix.sometable.someMetric.suffix1.suffix2.suffix3`, we need to try 11 times; if the pattern is `somePrefix\\\\.([^.]*)\\\\.someMetric\\\\.suffix1\\\\.suffix2\\\\.suffix3`, we need to try 25 times.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2048899423/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2048942782","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/12880#issuecomment-2048942782","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/12880","id":2048942782,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c56IGK-","user":{"login":"deepthi912","id":45308220,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzA4MjIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45308220?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepthi912","html_url":"https://github.com/deepthi912","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepthi912/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepthi912/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepthi912/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepthi912/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepthi912/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepthi912/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepthi912/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepthi912/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepthi912/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-11T05:17:30Z","updated_at":"2024-04-11T05:17:30Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/12885\r\n\r\nCould
