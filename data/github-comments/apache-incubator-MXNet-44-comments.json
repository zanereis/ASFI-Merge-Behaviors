Looks like I have an issue with numpy. The numpy installed is the python-numpy..I guess we would need python2.7-numpy. I may not get this package updated due to other constraints. \nI would want to use GPUs..is numpy required for running on GPUs? I have all other GPU packages including cuDNN..can I comment out the import numpy ?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/172921246/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/172950699","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/1253#issuecomment-172950699","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1253","id":172950699,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3Mjk1MDY5OQ==","user":{"login":"rfarouni","id":9895004,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4OTUwMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9895004?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfarouni","html_url":"https://github.com/rfarouni","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfarouni/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfarouni/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfarouni/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfarouni/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfarouni/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfarouni/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfarouni/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfarouni/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfarouni/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-19T18:55:36Z","updated_at":"2016-01-19T18:55:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I opened a pull request.

hi, i don't know why you think pooling kerenal(1,2) is correct? why not (2,1)? i modify my code:\nconv1 = mx.symbol.Convolution(data=act1, kernel=(4,), num_filter=20)\ntanh1 = mx.symbol.Activation(data=conv1, act_type=\"tanh\")\npool1 = mx.symbol.Pooling(data=tanh1, pool_type=\"max\",kernel=(2,1), stride=(2,1))\nit work now, but i am not sure it work  as my
