We want to allow users to use a custom pricing file without modifying any code (I think default to `~/.libcloud/pricing.json file if available is a good and straight-forward approach)\n2. Provide a simple mechanism to update the pricing file - it's still up to the user to reload the pricing file / invalidate the cache if they use libcloud in a long running process\n\n@Jc2k I do agree about the \"pricing always up to date in my app / script\" part - we need to provide programmatic API which users can call when they run their script or initialize the app.\n\nAs far as the celery goes - I personally think it's an overkill for a thing like this. If a CLI / \"run module\" style is available you can simply use a cron job.\n\nAs far as the \"run module\" style goes - I'm not to opinionated about this, although I'm not a big fun of `python -m libcloud.pricing` since it's less explicit than `libcloud update-pricing`.\n\nI would like to hear more opinion on this one.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/21807770/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/21807871","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/127#issuecomment-21807871","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/127","id":21807871,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxODA3ODcx","user":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-07-30T17:30:55Z","updated_at":"2013-07-30T17:30:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"P.S. @Jc2k - thanks for your feedback so far!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/21807871/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/21811160","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/127#issuecomment-21811160","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/127","id":21811160,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxODExMTYw","user":{"login":"Jc2k","id":11544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k","html_url":"https://github.com/Jc2k","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-07-30T18:18:39Z","updated_at":"2013-07-30T18:18:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"No problem!\n\nMy feedback so far has been from the angle of \"Libcloud is a library\". I find it weird that a library would have a binary as a default part of consuming that library. By all means have example scripts, or modules that you can run. But its a library. The programatic API should be very much \"the right way\" to do it.\n\nNone of my use cases are hindered by the presence of the command line API, but I strongly feel that a command line tool that appears in your bin/ dir sends the wrong message, that its the \"first class\" way to do things.

I like the explicit route to method mapping in the Brightbox mock. I think we can definitely improve current \"implicit\" mapping by making all the mappings explicit. Explicit mappings will make writing tests easier and it will also be more obvious to see what is going on.\n\nI think we could make it even better (and less error-prone) if a route would also contain an HTTP method (GET, etc.).\n1. I'm not a fan of `_to_json`, `_from_balancer` and other methods. It means we need to keep multiple things in sync (fixtures + those methods). The more things a developer needs to update, the easier it is to forget to update some, which means it more cumbersome and error prone.\n\nI would prefer to stick with just the response fixtures. This way it's easier to maintain and generate the fixtures.\n\nOverall I'm not too sure if I like the \"more intelligent\" / dynamic mocks approach. It basically means we are re-implementing dummy-like driver and logic for each provider. This has the following disadvantages (imo):\n- More things to keep up to date\n- It's easier to incorrectly implement a mock\n- We are actually just testing the mock API implementation and not the provider API which doesn't add any value imo.\n\nImo, tests should test the following things:\n- Test that each provider method calls the correct provider endpoint\n- Test that each method sends the right data (body + query string) along to the endpoint\n- Test that data returned by the endpoint is correctly parsed\n\nI would also love to hear other people's opinion.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/22839176/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/22879601","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/135#issuecomment-22879601","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/135","id":22879601,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyODc5NjAx","user":{"login":"Jc2k","id":11544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k","html_url":"https://github.com/Jc2k","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-08-19T15:19:13Z","updated_at":"2013-08-19T15:19:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I agree with you, I think, and you have stated the other half of my internal dialogue quite accurately :-)\n\nI was initially reluctant to stick with the fixtures because we would have to manually update the fixtures to get test data that was consistent enough to allow re-usable tests, but equally effectively requiring devs to implement both sides of the protocol is a bit extreme.\n\nMost of all I want to test that each method is sending the right data. The right arguments. The trouble is, if i parse the entire body all I can do is validate it is a valid request, not that it is the correct request for the arguments that were passed. I can see 2 ways to factor this.\n\nThe first is this branch. By \"round-tripping\" a request I can test that what i put in one end comes out of the other. I must be passing all the data i need to if i can get it back out of the other side.\n\nHowever i've just thought of a second that fits more naturally with keeping the fixtures. I can create a generic adaptor that records the arguments it was invoked with in a way that lets the mock peek at them, and then calls the driver. I can then parse the incoming body in my mock and make sure it matches the arguments passed to the driver, then return the hard-coded fixture file for that request.\n\nA secondary concern is duplication. If there are 4 variants of the `/balancer/list` API call then it's hard to factor the current mocks to avoid duplicate checking logic. (Is this where you see the route stuff in the Brightbox mock helping?).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/22879601/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/23259381","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/137#issuecomment-23259381","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/137","id":23259381,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMjU5Mzgx","user":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-08-26T12:35:05Z","updated_at":"2013-08-26T12:35:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"As noted in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LIBCLOUD-384, patch has been merged into trunk.\n\nThanks, you can close this pull request now.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/23259381/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/23363693","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/138#issuecomment-23363693","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/138","id":23363693,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMzYzNjkz","user":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-08-27T19:27:57Z","updated_at":"2013-08-27T19:27:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks.\n\nIt would also be great to add some tests as noted in the JIRA ticket.\n\nOtherwise the patch looks good to me and should be ready to be merged once the comments in this PR are addressed.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/23363693/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
