Even so, given your changes in this PR @merrimanr, I think you've found a compromise that works well for all cases. Nice work!\r\n\r\nIt looks like this is changing default behavior a bit, and I think it looks reasonable, but we could use some documentation around what the expected behavior should be. It looks like the order of operations is:\r\n* `outputTopic`, if present\r\n* else `parserConfig.getOutputTopic()`, if present\r\n* else `Constants.ENRICHMENT_TOPIC`\r\n\r\nAlso, where does `outputTopic` come from and how is it different from `parserConfig.getOutputTopic()`? is this from CLI options?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/481001227/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/481001663","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1376#issuecomment-481001663","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1376","id":481001663,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MTAwMTY2Mw==","user":{"login":"merrimanr","id":311928,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTkyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/311928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr","html_url":"https://github.com/merrimanr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-08T20:47:29Z","updated_at":"2019-04-08T20:47:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sure no problem.

Head back to Ambari and select the Kibana service http://node1:8080/#/main/services/KIBANA/summary\r\n6. Open the Kibana dashboard via the \"Metron UI\" option in the quick links\r\n7. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/658443/55191670-67b6e980-5168-11e9-9edd-4d346ed90da8.png)\r\n8.

Before we start adding enrichments, let's verify the enrichment_list table is empty\r\n1. Go to Swagger\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/658443/55909130-78b81f80-5b98-11e9-8666-6cb52ae22a12.png)\r\n1. Click the `sensor-enrichment-config-controller` option.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/658443/55909179-94232a80-5b98-11e9-898f-dd6cbfcb20fc.png)\r\n1. Click the `GET /api/v1/sensor/enrichment/config/list/available/enrichments` option.\r\n1. And finally click the \"Try it out!\" button. You should see an empty array returned in the response body.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/658443/55909333-f2e8a400-5b98-11e9-85d2-a2d496d4dff8.png)\r\n1. Now, let's perform an enrichment load. We'll do this as the metron user\r\n    ```\r\n    su - metron\r\n    source /etc/default/metron\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Download the alexa 1m dataset:\r\n    ```\r\n    wget http://s3.amazonaws.com/alexa-static/top-1m.csv.zip\r\n    unzip top-1m.csv.zip\r\n    ```\r\n1. Stage import file\r\n    ```\r\n    head -n 10000 top-1m.csv > top-10k.csv\r\n    # plop it on HDFS\r\n    hdfs dfs -put top-10k.csv /tmp\r\n    ```\r\n1. Create an extractor.json for the CSV data by editing `extractor.json` and pasting in these contents:\r\n    ```\r\n    {\r\n      \"config\": {\r\n        \"columns\": {\r\n          \"domain\": 1,\r\n          \"rank\": 0\r\n        },\r\n        \"indicator_column\": \"domain\",\r\n        \"separator\": \",\",\r\n        \"type\": \"alexa\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"extractor\": \"CSV\"\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\nThe extractor.json will get used by flatfile_loader.sh in the next step\r\n\r\n### Import from HDFS via MR\r\n\r\n```\r\n# truncate hbase\r\necho \"truncate 'enrichment'\" | hbase shell\r\n# import data into hbase \r\n$METRON_HOME/bin/flatfile_loader.sh -i /tmp/top-10k.csv -t enrichment -c t -e ./extractor.json -m MR\r\n# count data written and verify it's 10k\r\necho \"count 'enrichment'\" | hbase shell\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou should see a 10k count in the enrichment table. We'll add one more source of enrichment type before checking our enrichment list.\r\n\r\n## Streaming Enrichment\r\n\r\n1. Switch back to root if you're still the metron user.\r\n    ```\r\n    [metron@node1 ~]$ exit\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Pull down latest config from Zookeeper\r\n    ```\r\n    $METRON_HOME/bin/zk_load_configs.sh -m PULL -o ${METRON_HOME}/config/zookeeper -z $ZOOKEEPER -f\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Create a file named `user.json` in the parser directory.\r\n    ```\r\n    touch ${METRON_HOME}/config/zookeeper/parsers/user.json\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Enter these contents:\r\n    ```\r\n    {\r\n      \"parserClassName\" : \"org.apache.metron.parsers.csv.CSVParser\" ,\r\n      \"writerClassName\" : \"org.apache.metron.writer.hbase.SimpleHbaseEnrichmentWriter\",\r\n      \"sensorTopic\":\"user\",\r\n      \"parserConfig\": {\r\n        \"shew.table\" : \"enrichment\",\r\n        \"shew.cf\" : \"t\",\r\n        \"shew.keyColumns\" : \"ip\",\r\n        \"shew.enrichmentType\" : \"user\",\r\n        \"columns\" : {\r\n          \"user\" : 0,\r\n          \"ip\" : 1\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Push the changes back up to Zookeeper\r\n    ```\r\n    $METRON_HOME/bin/zk_load_configs.sh -m PUSH -i $METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper/ -z $ZOOKEEPER\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Create the user Kafka topic\r\n    ```\r\n    ${HDP_HOME}/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper $ZOOKEEPER --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic user\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Start the topology\r\n    ```\r\n    ${METRON_HOME}/bin/start_parser_topology.sh -s user -z $ZOOKEEPER\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Create a simple file with named `user.csv` with user mapping to IP, e.g.\r\n    ```\r\n    echo \"mmiklavcic,192.168.138.158\" > user.csv\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Push the data to Kafka\r\n    ```\r\n    tail user.csv | ${HDP_HOME}/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list $BROKERLIST --topic user\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Verify data makes it to the enrichment table.\r\n    ```\r\n    echo \"count 'enrichment'\" | hbase shell\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    There should be 10,001 records now.\r\n\r\n### Final check\r\n\r\n1. Check the Swagger UI again with our earlier steps. You should now see an \"alexa\" and a \"user\" enrichment type returned in the enrichment list results\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/658443/55911150-42c96a00-5b9d-11e9-80e7-a6c5c9f01dba.png)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/481850604/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/482142441","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1348#issuecomment-482142441","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1348","id":482142441,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MjE0MjQ0MQ==","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-11T14:40:02Z","updated_at":"2019-04-11T14:40:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> @JonZeolla: Yeah, that's the first version with associative arrays.\r\n\r\nSo this was introduced by a previous PR?  \r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate to add another dependency hurdle like this.
