If the agent is used, the rawCandidates will become 2 (including the one created by skywalking java agent), and Spring will have no conditions that can be met to recognize the constructor.

The postfork decorator is just the ticket. You can declare multiple postfork tasks. Each decorated function will be executed in sequence after each fork().\r\n\r\nDo you have a better solution? Maybe we can note this in skywalking's documentation, after all uWsgi is a popular library.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/1049588128/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/1049603436","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/8566#issuecomment-1049603436","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/8566","id":1049603436,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArmls84-j61s","user":{"login":"Superskyyy","id":26076517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDc2NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26076517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Superskyyy","html_url":"https://github.com/Superskyyy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Superskyyy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Superskyyy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Superskyyy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Superskyyy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Superskyyy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Superskyyy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Superskyyy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Superskyyy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Superskyyy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-24T08:21:59Z","updated_at":"2022-02-24T08:21:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@arcosx Hello, great to see you found a solution, would you mind opening a PR to document this?
