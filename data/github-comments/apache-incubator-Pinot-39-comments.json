The change makes a best effort attempt to track recently deleted segments using an in-memory cache. This does mean that on server restarts the segments retained out segments can be marked as missing.\r\n- When segments move or get refreshed with explicit state transitions (ie, an online->offline transition is triggered followed by a offline->online transition), and the query reaches a server after the online->offline transition), the server won't have the segment and we will count them as partial responses.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/475688738/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/476203810","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/4010#issuecomment-476203810","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/4010","id":476203810,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NjIwMzgxMA==","user":{"login":"sunithabeeram","id":3123798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjM3OTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3123798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunithabeeram","html_url":"https://github.com/sunithabeeram","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunithabeeram/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunithabeeram/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunithabeeram/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunithabeeram/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunithabeeram/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunithabeeram/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunithabeeram/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunithabeeram/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunithabeeram/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-25T13:46:29Z","updated_at":"2019-03-25T13:46:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Given this is a doc change, travis shouldn't have failed.

In\r\ntwo of the use cases there was about 30% heap usage reduction. In the third\r\nuse case there was a 7% heap usage increase, but I believe we should be able\r\nto find ways to fix this. In the fourth use case, with the current segment build, \r\none round of GC was triggered during the segment build, but no GC happened when\r\nsegments were built using columnar storage. So, we know there is a win for this\r\nuse case, just not how much and where.\r\n\r\nThe measurements were made by writing data from a realtime segment into a\r\nMutableSegment, and then running the segment builder with and without the\r\ncolumnar segment build prototype.\r\n\r\nThe commands 'jstat -gcutil' and 'jmap -histo' were used to measure the heap\r\nusage. The VM to build the segment was started with -Xmx32G -Xms32G -XX:NewSize=24g\r\nso that a GC is avoided.\r\n\r\nHere are the results for the three use cases:\r\n\r\nSavings  (absolute)\r\n\r\n               Case 1    Case 2    Case 3\r\n\r\n[I (int[])      173M      82M       -39M\r\n[C char[])      24M       147M      109M\r\n[B (byte[])     23M       118M      183M\r\n[S (short[])    6k        4k         5k\r\n[J (long[])     5M        72M        7M\r\n[Z (boolean[])            6M\r\nInteger         3M\r\nString          22M       129M       77M\r\nLong            -12M      -988M      96M\r\nObject          14M             \r\nKeyIterator     1M\r\n\r\nTotal Saved    260M      (434M)      433M\r\n\r\nPercentage     34%       (13%)       25%\r\n\r\nThese are savings for one segment build. Typically a server has (configurable)\r\nnumber of parallel segment builds going on.\r\n\r\nThe segment build time also improved, although the improvement was not quantified\r\n\r\n\r\nDescripton of use cases:\r\n\r\nCase 1: 30 dimension columns, no metric columns\r\nCase 2: 19 dimensions, 5 metrics, 11 no dictionary columns of Long type.\r\nCase 3: 3 dimension

Basically in `select uid from myTable limit 10` query, I got a random row with `uid` value shown as `\"c8b3bce0b378fc5ce8067fc271a34892\"` which is a hex string. And if I want to fetch this row with predicate, I should use the same hex string in my query, say \r\n`select * from myTable where uid=\"c8b3bce0b378fc5ce8067fc271a34892\"`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/478678169/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/478713959","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/4045#issuecomment-478713959","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/4045","id":478713959,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3ODcxMzk1OQ==","user":{"login":"mcvsubbu","id":2279037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzkwMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2279037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu","html_url":"https://github.com/mcvsubbu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-01T19:30:57Z","updated_at":"2019-04-01T19:30:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"just
