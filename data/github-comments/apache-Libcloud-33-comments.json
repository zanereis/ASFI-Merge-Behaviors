@tonybaloney!! #1060 was my attempt to remove all warnings detected by sphinx-build. But I soon realized two things:\r\n- there're way more sphinx warnings widespread throughout libcloud than I can handle\r\n- I'm not that good at dealing with sphinx issues ;)\r\n\r\nSo I deleted this branch. Instead, I created #1061 to not treat sphinx warnings as errors temporarily. In that way pending PRs like #1056, #1058 or #1062 may progress. Atm all builds fail consistently due to this documentation
