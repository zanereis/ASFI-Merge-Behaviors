an example of an instance where i also removed a Charset.defaultCharset() that was placed in the reading of a socket, where cloudstack controls both ends -> https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/400\nIf ConsoleProxyCmdHandler.java would run on a different encoding, you might have issues, so i changes all classes that used this to use UTF-8 explicitly. Charset.defaultCharset() should still work on CitrixConsoleProxyLoadCommandWrapper.java (if this runs on the agent side, didn't check) since platform that Xenserver  runs on also uses UTF-8 as a default.. but in the off chance the sysadmin screwed with the java defaults or this isn't running on the agent side, it might then fail.. this ensures it would work properly no matter what, it's always safer to do this if you control both the reader and the writer.\n\nAnd here's an example where i think it's most suited to use Charset.defaultCharset() , the output of a shell command:\nhttps://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/396\n\nIt's also possible to screw with the output of this from the system's side (although very unlikely), but this is the best approximation of 100% fail-proof of getting proper encoding of the input data.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/112232241/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/112313034","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/462#issuecomment-112313034","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/462","id":112313034,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExMjMxMzAzNA==","user":{"login":"DaanHoogland","id":2486961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODY5NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2486961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland","html_url":"https://github.com/DaanHoogland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-16T06:51:31Z","updated_at":"2015-06-16T06:51:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"convinced,
