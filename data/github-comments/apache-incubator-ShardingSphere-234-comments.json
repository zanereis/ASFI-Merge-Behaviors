Because ShardingSphere uses a variety of third-party components, they also have their own dependencies.\r\nThe more reliable methods are:\r\n1. Check the update log of guava to confirm the change of 18.0-29.0;\r\n2. Perform strict tests after integrating ShardingSphere to ensure that the features used meet expectations;\r\nAt the same time, like you, I look forward to other people’s better
