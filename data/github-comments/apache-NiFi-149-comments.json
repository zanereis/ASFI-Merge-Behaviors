Thanks for this improvement. Could you add a customValidate method to check the configuration of the processor and make it invalid if both brokers and host properties are set simultaneously, or if none of the properties are set? You may find similar pieces of code in other processors.\r\n> \r\n> Right now, one could leave all properties empty, the processor would be valid and throw NPE exceptions since the `connection` object would not be set.\r\n\r\nThe Host and Port have default values set. So NiFi reenters the default values in if you leave the properties empty.

Especially to make the processor invalid if brokers, host, and port are all set. Because in that case it could confuse the users wrt to which properties are actually used. I acknowledge this is explained in the properties description but this would make things more \"obvious\".\r\n> \r\n> We do that for some processors where it's possible to configure the same \"thing\" via multiple properties after we added some new properties over time and we kept the old ones to not break backward compatibility.\r\n> \r\n> That's my only remaining comment, latest changes look good to me.\r\n\r\nI could implement this, but it would require me to take off the default values for Host Name and Port. Otherwise, whenever Brokers is set, Host Name will take on its default value and cause a warning to appear. I'm not sure which is the lesser of two evils here, removing old functionality or not adding in clear and concise validation to ensure users understand which property is used.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/814967533/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/814974273","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4973#issuecomment-814974273","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4973","id":814974273,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxNDk3NDI3Mw==","user":{"login":"timeabarna","id":38653567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NjUzNTY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38653567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timeabarna","html_url":"https://github.com/timeabarna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timeabarna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timeabarna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timeabarna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timeabarna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timeabarna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timeabarna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timeabarna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timeabarna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timeabarna/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-07T14:45:17Z","updated_at":"2021-04-07T14:45:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@joshelser @bbende Josh and Bryan thank you very much for your help, PR has been updated","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/814974273/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/815002530","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4939#issuecomment-815002530","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4939","id":815002530,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxNTAwMjUzMA==","user":{"login":"pvillard31","id":11541012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTQxMDEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11541012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31","html_url":"https://github.com/pvillard31","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-07T15:21:14Z","updated_at":"2021-04-07T15:21:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yeah fair enough.
