It seems they both compute the precision as `Math.min(MAX_PRECISION, inputPrecision + 10)`. Maybe we can align with them. \r\n@wenhuitang @XuQianJin-Stars @hsyuan WDYT?\r\n\r\n[1]https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/54b87999fa0c23f9902faae609e7441e0693a22b/ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/udf/generic/GenericUDAFSum.java#L247\r\n\r\n[2]https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/272d229005b7166ab83bbb8f44a4d5e9d89424a1/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/aggregate/Sum.scala#L56\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/625128635/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/625172154","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/1839#issuecomment-625172154","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/1839","id":625172154,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNTE3MjE1NA==","user":{"login":"liyafan82","id":42827532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3NTMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42827532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyafan82","html_url":"https://github.com/liyafan82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyafan82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyafan82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyafan82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyafan82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyafan82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyafan82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyafan82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyafan82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyafan82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-07T10:34:28Z","updated_at":"2020-05-07T10:34:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closing this PR, as there are not enough justifications for it. \r\nThank all reviewers for the good comments.

I have rebased this pr. IMO, as for computing precision as Math.min(MAX_PRECISION, inputPrecision + 10), I did not find any theory or standard for it. To avoid the problem completely, it would be ok with max precision.

For `testSortFilter` test case, used suggested SQL query (the one that includes an aggregation).\r\n4. Added a new test case for sort-projection, which demonstrates in which case traits won't be propagated (e.g. order by CAST() where this cast does not preserve monotonicity, which is defined in https://github.com/apache/calcite/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/apache/calcite/sql/fun/SqlCastFunction.java#L65)\r\n\r\nCommit two is the change that set top-down opt globally false by default, include:\r\n1. `calcite.planner.topdown.opt=false` in saffron.properties.\r\n2. Some planner tests rolled back (from the change introduced by https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-3896)\r\n3. `CalciteConnectionProperty#TOPDOWN_OPT`'s default value is set by `CalciteSystemProperty.TOPDOWN_OPT.value()`.\r\n\r\n
