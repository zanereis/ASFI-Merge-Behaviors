@jaredjstewart,\r\n\r\nJust pushed the requested changes.\r\n\r\n- Renamed `PulseVerificationTest` to `PulseConnectivityTest`.\r\n- Removed `loginWithIncorrectPassword` test method, it is the same as the one in `PulseSecurityTest`.\r\n- Added integration tests to check the connectivity between PULSE and the local jmx-manager, both when the default and non-default bind-address is used.\r\n- Added `PulseAppListenerTest` unit test to verify that the repository is correctly configured by the `PulseAppListener` when PULSE is running in embedded

Jared, thank you for your feedback.\r\n\r\nThe initial use case that I was thinking of involved a user wanting to:\r\n\r\n- use Geode with another JDK (which doesn't have the `com.sun.org.apache...` Xerces implementation that the Oracle JDK uses), or\r\n- use Geode in an application where he/she wants to use the Apache Xerces implementation (which will be a dependency of the application) and sets the system property `javax.xml.parsers.SAXParserFactory` to `org.apache.xerces.jaxp.SAXParserFactoryImpl`.\r\n\r\nIn these cases `xercesImpl` is part of the environment (JDK, app) so I chose to use `xercesImpl` at only test runtime and \"load\" it via `System.setProperty()` in my unit tests.\r\n\r\nI don't see why it's needed at test compile time and I don't really understand your point about
