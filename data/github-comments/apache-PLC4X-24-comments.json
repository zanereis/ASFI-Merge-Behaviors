Cycle duration used for first tag will dictate cycle time for polling OPC-UA server:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/plc4x/blob/v0.12.0/plc4j/drivers/opcua/src/main/java/org/apache/plc4x/java/opcua/protocol/OpcuaProtocolLogic.java#L768\r\n\r\nIf not provided it is assumed to be 1s. OPC-UA protocol itself requires publish request to receive publish response with changed tag values, so you can reduce load, at the cost of bigger delay since possible value change.\r\n\r\n> I don't think there's any time limit on subscriptions, but they are only valid for the lifetime of the channel, and there is a channel-lifetime setting, which defines the maximum amount of time the channel will be open (in fact the server must leave the channel open 25% longer than this). Default is one hour, so after 75 minutes, you will be disconnected, unless you specify a higher channel-lifetime\r\n\r\nChannel lifetime is declared by server, when secure channel is open or renewed. For that reason we do not have a setting for that, we just rely on what server wants.\r\nIf you suspect any resource leak then renewing of channel might possibly be guilty (AFAIR it was guilty of some thread leak before), other place could be subscription handles which also need to submit asynchronously a publish request, beside your application logic.\r\nLook at these two places (OpcSubscriptionHandle.java and SecureChannel.java). If you have a lot of connect/disconnect cycles then both will fail to properly manage threads started within their internals.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/2486332384/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/2486345737","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/plc4x/issues/1896#issuecomment-2486345737","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/1896","id":2486345737,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBtifa86UMqAJ","user":{"login":"hyslopc","id":121499396,"node_id":"U_kgDOBz3vBA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/121499396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyslopc","html_url":"https://github.com/hyslopc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyslopc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyslopc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyslopc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyslopc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyslopc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyslopc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyslopc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyslopc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyslopc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-19T17:36:33Z","updated_at":"2024-11-19T17:36:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> Channel lifetime is declared by server, when secure channel is open or renewed.

Cycle duration used for first tag will dictate cycle time for polling OPC-UA server: https://github.com/apache/plc4x/blob/v0.12.0/plc4j/drivers/opcua/src/main/java/org/apache/plc4x/java/opcua/protocol/OpcuaProtocolLogic.java#L768\r\n> \r\n> If not provided it is assumed to be 1s. OPC-UA protocol itself requires publish request to receive publish response with changed tag values, so you can reduce load, at the cost of bigger delay since possible value change.\r\n> \r\n> > I don't think there's any time limit on subscriptions, but they are only valid for the lifetime of the channel, and there is a channel-lifetime setting, which defines the maximum amount of time the channel will be open (in fact the server must leave the channel open 25% longer than this). Default is one hour, so after 75 minutes, you will be disconnected, unless you specify a higher channel-lifetime\r\n> \r\n> Channel lifetime is declared by server, when secure channel is open or renewed. For that reason we do not have a setting for that, we just rely on what server wants. If you suspect any resource leak then renewing of channel might possibly be guilty (AFAIR it was guilty of some thread leak before), other place could be subscription handles which also need to submit asynchronously a publish request, beside your application logic. Look at these two places (OpcSubscriptionHandle.java and SecureChannel.java). If you have a lot of connect/disconnect cycles then both will fail to properly manage threads started within their internals.\r\n\r\n@splatch I will look into the files you mentioned. Will try Cyclic subscription and get back to you.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/2486386294/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/2486479351","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/plc4x/issues/1896#issuecomment-2486479351","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/1896","id":2486479351,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBtifa86UNKn3","user":{"login":"hyslopc","id":121499396,"node_id":"U_kgDOBz3vBA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/121499396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyslopc","html_url":"https://github.com/hyslopc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyslopc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyslopc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyslopc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyslopc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyslopc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyslopc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyslopc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyslopc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyslopc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-19T18:44:13Z","updated_at":"2024-11-19T18:44:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> OPC-UA protocol itself requires publish request to receive publish response with changed tag values, so you can reduce load, at the cost of bigger delay since possible value change.\r\n\r\nIt's correct that OPC-UA requires a publish request to receive a publish response, however it's not correct that a publish request must be sent every second, but I will file a separate bug report about that, so we don't get too off-topic on this one.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/2486479351/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/2486598549","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/plc4x/issues/1626#issuecomment-2486598549","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/1626","id":2486598549,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBtifa86UNnuV","user":{"login":"fdupont-epsilia","id":157042240,"node_id":"U_kgDOCVxGQA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157042240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fdupont-epsilia","html_url":"https://github.com/fdupont-epsilia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fdupont-epsilia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fdupont-epsilia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fdupont-epsilia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fdupont-epsilia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fdupont-epsilia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fdupont-epsilia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fdupont-epsilia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fdupont-epsilia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fdupont-epsilia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-19T19:41:44Z","updated_at":"2024-11-19T19:41:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I did a PR.

I had a look and there were several issues:\n1. You name the protocol \"fins\" in protocols/omron/src/main/java/org/apache/plc4x/protocol/omron/FinsProtocol.java but you try to use it as \"omron\" in plc4j/drivers/omron/pom.xml ... the two have to match, I tried setting it to \"fins\" and it picked up the protocol definition\n2. Your mspec had multiple issues:\n    - There was an odd prefix to the mspec: \"好的，根据你提供的西门子PLC S7协议的MSpec文件结构，我将为你生成一个详细的Omron FINS协议的MSpec文件。这个文件将包括FINS协议的基本消息结构、请求和响应消息、以及一些常见的命令和响应。\n\n### Omron FINS协议MSpec文件\n\n```freemarker\" ... that needed to be removed. \n     - You repeatedly defined byte-arrays like this:\n             [simple byte[] data length 'wordCount * 2'] \n        However this needed to be changed to: \n            [array  byte    data length 'wordCount * 2']\n        (Notice the keyword \"array\" instead of \"simple\"? Also the bracets needed to be removed\n     - In line 192 (187 after removing the header) you define a string simple type ... strings need a fixed number of bits ... vstring doesn't, but that requires an expression on how long the string should be\n     - Your enum FINSResponseCode had one additional closing square bracket, that needed to be removed\n\nWith these changes I was able to generate the code for your mspec and compile it.\n\nI did add a config option to skip the maven-dependency-plugin execution as you're just starting to implement your driver ... no need to get too confused about that.
