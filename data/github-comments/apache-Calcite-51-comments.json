Sure, the epoch is 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC, but you could also think of it as 1969-01-01 16:00:00 PST.

@twdsilva thanks for the PR, I think it's a very useful feature, I still share the doubts that @julianhyde raised in a [jira comment](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-5240?focusedCommentId=17598705&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-17598705) (copying a filter into the view seems hacky and does not always seem safe) and that @zabetak raised [in the ML](https://lists.apache.org/thread/6c1x985qrzjvd1tc38kmcj56hs9q43bw) (isn't there a way to modify the query to match the view, instead of changing the view and making view matching more complex?).\r\n> \r\n> In the same ML discussion, you have raised a question on this point, I don't have an answer to that myself, but I feel that the we all need to agree that we are going into the right direction before being able to merge the PR.\r\n\r\nThank you @asolimando for the review. \r\nWe have a use case where we maintain materialized preaggregated cubes that store data rolled up to the UTC day or hour. The queries in our system always have a time range predicate that doesn't neccesarily align on the UTC day or boundary. We would like to use the materialized cube(s) table whenever possible as they contain a lot fewer rows than the base table. Here is an [example](https://github.com/twilio/calcite-kudu/blob/30c0d4e7b1d15288f7c30cdfda885c0c3a4666bf/adapter/src/test/java/com/twilio/kudu/sql/ScenarioIT.java#L278).\r\nI could not figure how to get `MaterializedViewAggregateRule`  to handle the case when a view contains a rollup (has a group by with a `FLOOR(col)`) other than rewriting the view to include a predicate based on the query predicate. The existing code that uses the union operator works if we include this generated predicate. The other main change is to map `FLOOR(col)` to col which is valid because the predicate added to the view is aligned on the floored value of the query predicate. If there is a cleaner way to make this work I would appreciate any pointers. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/1336037626/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/1337477401","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/2983#issuecomment-1337477401","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/2983","id":1337477401,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAUNjNM5PuEkZ","user":{"login":"rubenada","id":19411329,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDExMzI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19411329?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenada","html_url":"https://github.com/rubenada","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenada/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenada/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenada/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenada/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenada/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenada/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenada/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenada/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenada/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-05T14:34:23Z","updated_at":"2022-12-05T14:34:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@JiajunBernoulli the fix LGTM, but I am not very familiar with SqlToRelConverter's logic.\r\nLet's wait to see if some other contributor that knows this part of the code better can take a look.
