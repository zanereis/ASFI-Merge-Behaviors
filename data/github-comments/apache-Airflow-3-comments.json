Only one instance of a task will be scheduled to run at a time, and from there it's simply a matter of whether the sensor triggers or not. This does mean, though, that if you have a sensor that never triggers for some reason, your schedule will be totally blocked by that. So that may mean that airflow isn't really designed for passively waiting for something to happen so much as it is for actively checking for things to do on a schedule.\n\nAs a design consideration: if an early task in a DAG is able to determine that there's nothing to do when its schedule rolls around, it would be nice to be able to quickly mark the rest of that scheduled DAG as complete when it makes sense to do so. Perhaps this could be signaled by a \"skipped\" status, along with mechanisms for allowing downstream tasks to determine their own behavior based on the completion statuses of their upstreams. Food for future thought, unless that's something you guys have already considered and discarded, in which case I'd love to hear more about why.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/115337365/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/115361132","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/72#issuecomment-115361132","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/72","id":115361132,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNTM2MTEzMg==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-25T18:52:51Z","updated_at":"2015-06-25T18:52:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Not sure, the sphinx automagic works out of class doctrings, not object content. \n\nBut it would be easy to put something together in the DAG object that would gather the `doc_md` string from the DAG object and all the tasks in the DAG and put together some a raw html page.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/115361132/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/115415829","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/75#issuecomment-115415829","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/75","id":115415829,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNTQxNTgyOQ==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-25T22:09:26Z","updated_at":"2015-06-25T22:09:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"You're right, as it is now the scheduler won't parallelize or fill in holes. Note that `airflow backfill` does though. The way the scheduler operates is documented here:\n\nhttp://pythonhosted.org/airflow/scheduler.html\n\n`depends_on_past` keeps from scheduling forward after a failure. And forces sequential execution for backfills (who do parallelize not `depends_on_past` tasks).\n\nAdding a `skipped` or `upstream_failed` status as you suggested would allow for non `depends_on_past` tasks to move forward without changing the current scheduler logic much. I haven't done it yet because I may want this status to be virtual, but it requires more complexity in the scheduler and could affect the scheduler's weight on the metadata database and cycling time. We like for the scheduler to run every minute, even with 10k+ tasks which could grow 10x over the next few years. \n\nThe `upstream_failed` status is probably the way to go, though since the scheduler never moves back to fill in holes, it would require running backfill commands to fill in holes left behind. Maybe once we have a UI wizard to do that it won't matter much.\n\nI also may want to trigger the current latest schedule regardless of what the DAG is up to, that brings back the problem around filling holes.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/115415829/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/115429232","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/77#issuecomment-115429232","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/77","id":115429232,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNTQyOTIzMg==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-25T23:26:51Z","updated_at":"2015-06-25T23:26:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This is a little beyond me, but I'd love to know how to encapsulate the processes, let me know if you have pointers. \n\nWe une chef->runit->sv and some operations have been problematic, notably when running a multi-thread tornado web server and trying to restart it with `sv`, processes aren't killed like they should.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/115429232/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/115445549","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/80#issuecomment-115445549","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/80","id":115445549,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNTQ0NTU0OQ==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-26T00:38:52Z","updated_at":"2015-06-26T00:38:52Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I see the case for a branch operator, though we tend to wire things down different path by using an attribute of the data, and an empty batch typically never happens except if there is a problem.\n\nAn easy implementation would be to essentially derive the `PythonOperator` into a `BranchPythonOperator`, and have the assumption that the `python_callable` returns the name of the branch to take, namely the task_id of the direct downstream task to follow.

It will actually execute the task locally, but it does not leave logs or update the database that the test was run. I don't know what purpose start_date serves here.\n- \"airflow run\" is used to run a single task through the scheduler (does start_date here mean \"run for a particular date?\".  I just see the current date in the logs ) \n- \"airflow backfill\" is used to populate the schedule with records to run tasks from a dag in the correct order, respecting the dependencies. Here the start_date and end_date mean the date range for which to schedule the dag with an indicated interval.\n\nThe use of the 'date' parameter without a time part also implies that the dag's are intended to be complex batch jobs that run once per day. Is this correct?\n- If a task failed and it is rerun ( \"airflow run\"?  ) and it succeeds along with the rest of the dag, then in the end airflow reports \"all green\" for the task on a particular day. You can rerun tasks, but they will just be rerun in the same 'day' context, so it does not make sense.\n- corner case: If you have a dag that failed and work up to 1am to resolve it, how does the task show up?  As the \"start_date\" with which it ran, or just using the current date of the machine?  Is airflow clever enough to consider it part of the previous day's run ( in the logs, etc? ). Does it make sense to try to resolve issues after midnight with airflow?\n- When writing airflow operators and tasks, should one use the 'start_date'/'end_date' as input parameter for the work or can any task just use the current machine date / time?  This is a very important decision, because it makes results reproducible (or not). \n\nI noticed that if you use 'backfill' to create jobs to run, it will also create historic records for that. So if you specify start_date from 2015-01-01, it will create records for every date up to now and run them in the scheduler.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/116766098/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/116772617","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/88#issuecomment-116772617","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/88","id":116772617,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNjc3MjYxNw==","user":{"login":"artwr","id":1518713,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTg3MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1518713?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr","html_url":"https://github.com/artwr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-29T17:44:02Z","updated_at":"2015-06-29T17:44:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I

and answers:\n- `start_date` is mostly used by the scheduler (`airflow scheduler`) to know where to start running from for each task. If you commit a new task to your DAG, the scheduler will attempt to run that task starting on that date. Also for tasks that are `depends_on_past==True`, we don't care about that flag for the `start_date`\n- Much like `airflow test`, `airflow run` allows you to trigger a single \"task instance\" with a set of options documented in the CLI doc and displayable by running `airflow run -h`. It cares about dependencies, and records its success/failure in the DB\n\nThe assumption is that your DAG has a start_date and a schedule_interval. If you have a schedule_interval of `timedelta(hours=1)`, the scheduler will schedule your DAG to run every hour. The state is recorded for each task instance, which is a task for a specific schedule. The \"_date\" params receive a `datetime.datetime` in the API and a parsable datetime string in the CLI. You can use `2015-01-01`, or `2015-01-01T00:00` or `2015-01-01T01:00` in the CLI, anything that the dateutils lib will parse, that matches your schedule.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/116825586/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/116850891","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/89#issuecomment-116850891","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/89","id":116850891,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNjg1MDg5MQ==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-29T21:26:59Z","updated_at":"2015-06-29T21:26:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":":+1: \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/116850891/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/116887470","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/87#issuecomment-116887470","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/87","id":116887470,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNjg4NzQ3MA==","user":{"login":"gtoonstra","id":441978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTk3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/441978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtoonstra","html_url":"https://github.com/gtoonstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtoonstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtoonstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtoonstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtoonstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtoonstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtoonstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtoonstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtoonstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtoonstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-30T00:31:48Z","updated_at":"2015-06-30T00:31:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Created a pull request with a proposal on making this clearer.

It's also expected to raise an exception as a way to communicate an error.\n\nIt may be tricky to generalize an HttpOperator since all systems expect different endpoints, payload and return different results. Using a PythonOperator that uses the requests lib is the quick way to do this. Maybe an HttpSensor would be generic enough, receiving an enpoint, payload and a regex to match in the response.\n\nI don't know much about `remap`, but maybe a RemapOperator would make more sense. In general, it's probably a better approach, so that instead of receiving generic `enpoint` and `payload`, it can receive something more meaningful like `job_name`, `parameters_dict` or whatever makes sense for that specific external system.\n\nA side note about hooks, they use the Connection model to store connection information as opposed to hard-coding it in script. It may be nice to have a thin HttpHook that would retrieve that info from the DB and acts as some thin wrapper around the requests lib. I'm not 100% on this though, it may not add a whole lot of value (vs confusion)...\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/117211810/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/117226014","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/93#issuecomment-117226014","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/93","id":117226014,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNzIyNjAxNA==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-30T15:20:48Z","updated_at":"2015-06-30T15:20:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"\"A run for a task instance will then only happen if previous runs of the **directly** downstream tasks of that task are **succesful**.\"\n\nIf you want to force the completion of the entire DAG, you'll need to put a trigger (say you could land a dummy trigger file in HDFS or S3) at the very end of all the tasks in your DAG, and use a sensor at the very beginning of your DAG (waiting for that that trigger file to show up in HDFS or S3).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/117226014/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/117247308","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/92#issuecomment-117247308","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/92","id":117247308,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNzI0NzMwOA==","user":{"login":"gtoonstra","id":441978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTk3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/441978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtoonstra","html_url":"https://github.com/gtoonstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtoonstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtoonstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtoonstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtoonstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtoonstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtoonstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtoonstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtoonstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtoonstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-30T16:33:27Z","updated_at":"2015-06-30T16:33:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"So I put something preliminary together of a hook and a sensor to get an idea of the complexity. You can see this development branch at:\n\nhttps://github.com/airbnb/airflow/compare/master...gtoonstra:http_protocol_sensor\n\nI agree, the flavours of what's written with HTTP is too rich to create anything that is generic enough and attempts in such generic approaches usually start to pollute other areas with logic, for example here proliferation of logic into the DAG's. \n\nIn the branch, the hook raises exceptions, but I think most of those should be moved to the operator instead. This is based on the assumption that the operator class decides on success or failure based on the responses of the hook, not the hook itself. In cases of database when a db was expected and didn't exist, the hook is allowed to raise exceptions.\n\nThen all we need probably for now is a SimpleHttpOperator, which is limited to the following:\n- it fails or succeeds on the return code only, not on the response content.\n- it only supports a 'one-shot' call, no cookies, sessions or conversations, so no calls in a sequence.\n- maybe add a 'regex' on the \"GET\" call to check the state of the object beyond the return code (existence).  \n- it has a timeout and never uses a persistent connection.\n- only supports basic auth of login and password.\n\nAnything beyond this simple use requires a specific operator:\n- file upload/download over http, special auth schemes, http conversations and sessions, special mime-types, etc.\n\nSo the remap operator probably falls into the latter category.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/117247308/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/117271622","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/96#issuecomment-117271622","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/96","id":117271622,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNzI3MTYyMg==","user":{"login":"artwr","id":1518713,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTg3MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1518713?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr","html_url":"https://github.com/artwr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-30T17:30:25Z","updated_at":"2015-06-30T17:30:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Awesome!\n![excited_vhg](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1518713/8437289/fcbbc37a-1f12-11e5-9a52-7563e09d4b0b.gif)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/117271622/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/117272873","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/80#issuecomment-117272873","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/80","id":117272873,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNzI3Mjg3Mw==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-30T17:33:32Z","updated_at":"2015-06-30T17:33:32Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"https://github.com/airbnb/airflow/pull/96\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/117272873/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/117275082","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/93#issuecomment-117275082","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/93","id":117275082,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNzI3NTA4Mg==","user":{"login":"rijuk","id":2475254,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzUyNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475254?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rijuk","html_url":"https://github.com/rijuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rijuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rijuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rijuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rijuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rijuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rijuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rijuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rijuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rijuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-30T17:39:13Z","updated_at":"2015-06-30T17:39:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/117275082/reactions","total_count":0,"+1

You could alter your function to expect sql (templated) as a `str` instead of the sql file location. This would avoid you relying on jinja/airflow internal magic to resolve the file's content. So a good old `open()` there making sure you use a relative path to `__file__` allows you to get rid of the `task.__class__.template_ext` affectation.\n\nNow I'd be careful in your function header of defining `ds` or anything else out of the airflow context because it will strip it out of `kwargs` as kwargs is the placeholder for all non-defined keyword args. Then `ds` doesn't make it through in the `render_template` call. So I'd remove `ds` from the header and get it out of `kwargs` (like `task`). `sql_template` though isn't part of the airflow context, so that one you can have in the header.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/117721774/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/117745355","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/101#issuecomment-117745355","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/101","id":117745355,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNzc0NTM1NQ==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-01T16:46:34Z","updated_at":"2015-07-01T16:46:34Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Oops.\n![img](http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/whid.gif)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/117745355/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/117747748","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/90#issuecomment-117747748","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/90","id":117747748,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNzc0Nzc0OA==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-01T16:51:20Z","updated_at":"2015-07-01T16:51:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"![img](http://www.reactionface.info/sites/default/files/imagecache/Node_Page/images/1310672139462.jpg)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/117747748/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/117834683","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/99#issuecomment-117834683","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/99","id":117834683,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNzgzNDY4Mw==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-01T21:52:22Z","updated_at":"2015-07-01T21:52:22Z","author_association":"M

In this schema, the task for July 1st does not run on July 1st, because all of the data dependencies have not usually landed yet. We wait until that `schedule_interval` is over and then start processing the data. \nIn your example, it means that the daily task for July 1st will actually kick off in the first seconds of July 2nd when this condition is met.\n\nI hope this helps.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/117898259/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/117910143","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/102#issuecomment-117910143","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/102","id":117910143,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNzkxMDE0Mw==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-02T05:26:04Z","updated_at":"2015-07-02T05:26:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I just added a note in the docs to clarify this here http://pythonhosted.org/airflow/scheduler.html:\n\n```\nNote that if you run a DAG on a schedule_interval of one day, the run stamped 2016-01-01 will be trigger soon after 2016-01-01T23:59.

I think this is solid as far as I can tell. A few details:\n- I'd throw `endpoint` in `template_fields` for sensor as well. `template_fields` is a bad name for this feature, but the idea is that sometime between the `__init__` and the `execute` method is run, the object attributes in that list get templated. So say if someone would want a date in their endpoint they would have to use templating for that, as in `endpoint = \"/apiv2/user/getmodified/{{ execution_date.isoformat()[:10].replace(\"-\", \"\") }}\"`\n- add an entry in `docs/code.rst` for your 2 operators and hook to show up in the API part of the documentation\n- a unit test would be nice in `airflow/tests/core.py`\n\nAnother thought (outside the scope of this PR) is around authentication. I read the `requests` library part about sessions and authentication and it seem like people could graft that onto the hook you wrote eventually to support different types of authentication.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/118428280/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/118560523","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/107#issuecomment-118560523","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/107","id":118560523,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExODU2MDUyMw==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-04T22:26:56Z","updated_at":"2015-07-04T22:26:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Every

If you happen to be running an `airflow scheduler`, it will monitor your `DAGS_FOLDER` and keep the list up to date.\n\nThere's an hidden endpoint at `/admin/airflow/refresh_all` that will refresh the web server's DagBag from scratch.\n\nAlso note that if you run the web server in debug mode `airflow webserver --debug`, it will refresh your dags as you update them, though there are limitations here.\n\nThe challenge is that in our environment we have multiple multi-threaded server, and that each thread has its own DagBag. With many DAGs, some very large, refreshing the DagBags in the scope of a web request is a bad idea. Anyhow, we'll have 100% stateless web servers soon as we move to run everything off of serialized, versioned DAGs that live in the DB.

I misunderstood. I thought in the checking of dependencies, `airflow run` ensure that upstream tasks also get run.  Evidently, that is not the case.  It seems that `airflow run` behaves more like `airflow test` and less like `airflow backfill`.  I think what I want to do in order to test a whole DAG, \"from soup to nuts\" is to use `airflow backfill`.  I'm curious what the use cases for `airflow test` and `airflow run` are.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/120486293/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/120490542","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/123#issuecomment-120490542","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/123","id":120490542,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyMDQ5MDU0Mg==","user":{"login":"gtoonstra","id":441978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTk3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/441978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtoonstra","html_url":"https://github.com/gtoonstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtoonstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtoonstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtoonstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtoonstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtoonstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtoonstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtoonstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtoonstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtoonstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-10T18:39:44Z","updated_at":"2015-07-10T18:39:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"A hook is basically a connection to some system. So an operator and a sensor would use a \"hook\"  to connect to hive to execute query \"X\", which effects some update (operator) or checks on the results of some rows (sensor). I just finished a pull request for a new http operator, which can talk to many HTTP-based systems. An operator would usually use POST/PUT or DELETE (through the hook) and the sensor would usually use a \"GET\" request. \n\nMost hooks require a connection declaration. Rather than encoding that into every hook itself, there's a connections tab on the admin menu (of the webserver), where you can configure what ops and sensors connect to. So that way you keep username/pw and host configs out of the way of code. In the DAG you can then still refer to specific connection-id's. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/120490542/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
