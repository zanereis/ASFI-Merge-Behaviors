Raw JMX already does that, although the nodetool command make it more handy.

It's has the same cause as CASSANDRA-12236,\r\nCASSANDRA-12697 and CASSANDRA-13382: the new column is not accepted by older nodes and must be hidden from the propagated schema when not set.\r\n\r\nThe solution I went with is to remove the `memtable` value from the schema table when it is at default, i.e. replace `\"default\"` with `null` for that case, make sure the column definition for the sent mutation only lists columns that are actually present in the mutation, and use a row deletion to ensure an older `memtable` value does not persist when switching from a schema that contains it, i.e. when resetting a table's memtable implementation to default.\r\n\r\nPlease take a look at these changes -- the tests appear to be passing, but I'd like to know your opinion on this approach, especially the schema row deletion.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/comments/1110724526/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/comments/1110848050","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/1538#issuecomment-1110848050","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/1538","id":1110848050,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmWM5CNjIy","user":{"login":"smiklosovic","id":588603,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODYwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/588603?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smiklosovic","html_url":"https://github.com/smiklosovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smiklosovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smiklosovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smiklosovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smiklosovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smiklosovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smiklosovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smiklosovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smiklosovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smiklosovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-27T10:39:32Z","updated_at":"2022-04-27T10:39:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"merged
