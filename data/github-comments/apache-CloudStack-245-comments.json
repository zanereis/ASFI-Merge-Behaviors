For example, instead of fixing the string, we can refactor the core methods to accept objects and the core methods (in CallContext or other helper classes) can export json/xml/serializable formats. This can improve the ease of consuming event logs.\r\n- I've another suggestion, current events are tied to domain/accounts but not with entities such as VMs, Volumes, Hosts etc, maybe introduce a new db column in the event table that accepts a list of (related) entities to which the event statements be linked to. This can help unlock a new user experience and make it easier to search events tied to a resource, such as all events related to a VM, volume, host etc. This can be used in future to have a events tab for each such supported resources.\r\n\r\nAs phase-1, the refactoring effort to move from ID to UUID looks okay to me, however, it still does not cover/fix all the cases where IDs are used instead of UUID in all the APIs. I would expect that with this large refactoring effort you may consider moving towards a small framework solution, where you export UUIDs and related objects and that framework/class is responsible for exporting the object to string, i.e. event description + entity (possibly in json etc). In CloudStack UI, the json may then be consumed to output the same sort of string like you see in the screenshots.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/332726534/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/332729267","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/2260#issuecomment-332729267","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/2260","id":332729267,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMjcyOTI2Nw==","user":{"login":"PranaliM","id":24890708,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODkwNzA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24890708?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PranaliM","html_url":"https://github.com/PranaliM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PranaliM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PranaliM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PranaliM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PranaliM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PranaliM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PranaliM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PranaliM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PranaliM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PranaliM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-28T05:10:34Z","updated_at":"2017-09-28T05:10:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rhtyd : Could you please merge this change ?
