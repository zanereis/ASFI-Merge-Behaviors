Just ask me here.\n\nAt present, we are typically in the profiles of Alice-Bob-Sam, as described in [Artem's GSoC proposal](https://github.com/stratosphere/stratosphere/wiki/GSoC-2014-Project-Proposal-Draft-by-Artem-Tsikiridis).\nHadoop seems to be the starting square for our Stratosphere / Flink journey.\nSame is the situation with developers in the above 2 companies :-)\n\nBriefly,\nWe have installed and run some example programmes from Flink / Stratosphere (versions 0.5.2 and 0.6). We use a cluster (the grid5000 for our Hadoop & Stratosphere installations)\nWe have some good understanding of Hadoop and its use in Streaming and Pipes in conjunction with scripting languages (Python & R specifically)\nIn the first phase, we would like to run some \"Hadoop-like\" jobs (mainly multiple M-R workflows) on Stratosphere, preferably with extensive Java or Scala programming.\nI refer to your [GSoC project map](https://github.com/stratosphere/stratosphere/wiki/%5BGSoC-14%5D-A-Hadoop-abstraction-layer-for-Stratosphere-%28Project-Map-and-Notes%29) which seems very interesting.\nIf we could have a Hadoop abstraction as you have mentioned, that would be ideal for our first phase.\nIn later phases, when we implement complex join and group operations, we would dive deeper into Stratosphere / Flink Java or Scala APIs\n\nHence, I would like to know, what is the current status in this direction?\nWhat has been implemented already? In which version onwards? How to try them?\nWhat is yet to be implemented? When - which versions?\n\nYou may also like to see [my discussion with Robert on this page](http://flink.incubator.apache.org/docs/0.6-incubating/cli.html#comment-1558297261).\nI am still mining into different discussions - here as well as on JIRA.\nPlease do refer me to the relevant links, JIRA tickets, etc if that saves your time in re-typing large replies.\nIt will help us to catch up fast with the train of collective thinking in the Stratosphere / Flink roadmap, and eventually contribute to the project.\n\nThanks in advance,\nAnirvan\nPS : Apologies for using names / rechristened names (e.g. Flink / Stratosphere) as I am not sure, which name to use currently.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/53571986/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/53575301","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/37#issuecomment-53575301","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/37","id":53575301,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNTc1MzAx","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-27T13:54:37Z","updated_at":"2014-08-27T13:54:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi

The initial value for the reduce function and the count operator are tightly connected. The reduce with initial value is the general solution, of which the count operator is a special case. Therefore, I wouldn't say that these are independent features.
