I guess with my example of `199/100 == 1`, I'm simply arguing that it's silly to return the same data type. Which is why I guess e.g. MongoDB also returns a double.

I saw something similar when trying to use it in there WHERE clause.\r\n\r\nHere's a quite simple code snippet:\r\n``` Java\r\nimport org.apache.metamodel.DataContext;\r\nimport org.apache.metamodel.data.DataSet;\r\nimport org.apache.metamodel.mongodb.mongo3.MongoDbDataContext;\r\nimport org.apache.metamodel.util.SimpleTableDef;\r\n\r\nimport com.mongodb.MongoClient;\r\n\r\nclass Test {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        final DataContext mongoDbDataContext =\r\n                new MongoDbDataContext(new MongoClient(\"192.168.99.100\").getDatabase(\"test\"),\r\n                        new SimpleTableDef(\"inventory\",\r\n                                new String[] { \"item\", \"qty\", \"tags\", \"size.h\", \"size.w\", \"size.uom\" }));\r\n\r\n        final DataSet ds = mongoDbDataContext.executeQuery(\"SELECT SUBSTRING(item, 1, 4) from inventory\");\r\n        ds.forEach(System.out::println);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nValues are those inserted here: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/insert-documents/#insert-multiple-documents\r\n\r\n\r\nBTW, for Mongo3, the integration test is a single line from working, so maybe add a few tests around maps to that one.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/349448872/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/349519495","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metamodel/pull/171#issuecomment-349519495","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/171","id":349519495,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0OTUxOTQ5NQ==","user":{"login":"kaspersorensen","id":291450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTQ1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/291450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen","html_url":"https://github.com/kaspersorensen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-06T03:19:18Z","updated_at":"2017-12-06T03:19:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Oh, I'll look at ensuring that substring actually works. \r\n\r\nWhat do you mean by \"for Mongo3 the integration test is a single line from working\" ?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/349519495/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/349523349","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metamodel/pull/171#issuecomment-349523349","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/171","id":349523349,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0OTUyMzM0OQ==","user":{"login":"kaspersorensen","id":291450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTQ1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/291450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen","html_url":"https://github.com/kaspersorensen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-06T03:45:31Z","updated_at":"2017-12-06T03:45:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hmm I \"fixed\" substring, at least ensured that it's returning the right results, similar to Java's `String.substring` method.

bit of clarification to answer my own question/worry: It seems that the `Consumer.unsubscribe(..)` call is the best thing I can reasonably do. This seems to remove any Zookeeper entry for the consumer group. I think. At least on my own system where I'm testing, I can't see any trace of my consumers in Zookeeper. But the things that I don't think we can ever get rid of are the entries/records in the consumer_offsets topic that is internal to Kafka.\r\n\r\nI've been thinking that the best possibility would be to try and alleviate the problem by reusing existing Consumer group IDs. Implemented by using some pool of group IDs where leases for a group ID are granted when querying and returned when the DataSet is closed. But then again, that would make concurrent queries (or even worse - queries from multiple processes or nodes) very hard to manage because we would never know for sure that another MetaModel client wasn't _also_ firing a query with the same Consumer group ID. So my conclusion so far is that it isn't really improvable, except maybe by giving some hooks back to the user in case he really worries about storing too much consumer group information.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/361131847/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/361248606","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metamodel/pull/178#issuecomment-361248606","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/178","id":361248606,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MTI0ODYwNg==","user":{"login":"tomatophantastico","id":1636462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzY0NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1636462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomatophantastico","html_url":"https://github.com/tomatophantastico","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomatophantastico/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomatophantastico/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomatophantastico/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomatophantastico/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomatophantastico/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomatophantastico/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomatophantastico/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomatophantastico/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomatophantastico/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-29T13:42:16Z","updated_at":"2018-01-29T13:42:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi,\r\n\r\nI am not sure, if i get the targeted use case here right, so intuitively i would hesitate to use this MM module for querying the Kafka, because: \r\n\r\n1) In Kafka message values are binary values (right?) and will often carry complex messages.

I might just go ahead and do it, but I don't feel like committing to it right now since I don't know when my time permits doing it.\r\n\r\nwrt 2) Again I would argue that the same holds true for e.g. Cassandra. Some of the databases we support are simply not always well fit for a SQL like abstraction which MetaModel is. But OTOH there are also plenty of cases (including a project that I'm on at work) where Kafka is used not because it's massive volume, but because it has other compelling features (replication, load balancing, auto purging). In such a case I really almost don't mind if I end up scanning the complete stream to find the record that I'm looking for. It's such a rare event and not critical in sense of performance, but giving me the MetaModel module provides me with an easy abstraction to implement it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/361386730/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/361407624","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metamodel/pull/178#issuecomment-361407624","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/178","id":361407624,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MTQwNzYyNA==","user":{"login":"tomatophantastico","id":1636462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzY0NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1636462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomatophantastico","html_url":"https://github.com/tomatophantastico","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomatophantastico/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomatophantastico/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomatophantastico/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomatophantastico/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomatophantastico/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomatophantastico/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomatophantastico/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomatophantastico/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomatophantastico/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-29T22:23:34Z","updated_at":"2018-01-29T22:23:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"wrt 1) no, not required. if you got a use case, then this is fine with me.

like what this PR does, but it seems a bit one-off to me. It's nice to see us supporting on-the-fly column definitions during insert, but the same principle could also apply for other connectors we have, such as the ones for CouchDB, MongoDB, ElasticSearch and more. So since the approach is a bit bespoke for HBase, and we don't know if there will be some consolidation later if we end up implementing something a bit more generic for these types of datastores, I think for now we should add the `@InterfaceStability.Evolving` annotation to the HBaseDataContext.
