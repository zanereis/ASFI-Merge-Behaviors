Without a factory, each instance would need to know the full structure of the `Note` entity and the necessary attributes to set, (e.g. when creating `LoanTransactionNote` we should set `client` attribute as well).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, a factory method allows us to encapsulate extra logic, such as fetching required data, applying business rules, or performing validation ...etc \r\nBTW, I understand your concerns about validation at the domain level, and your suggestion to enforce it at the database schema. However, as @marta-jankovics  pointed out earlier \"it's too late, and the error message is too ugly\".\r\n\r\nRegarding static methods, perhaps we could establish guidelines to ensure they’re only created when necessary and in an acceptable form.\r\n\r\nI'd like to know your thoughts on how we might balance these concerns while keeping the codebase as maintainable and clear as possible.\r\n\r\nBest regards!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/2303531778/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/2303819115","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/4020#issuecomment-2303819115","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/4020","id":2303819115,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAuLPJ86JUX1r","user":{"login":"vidakovic","id":380079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MDA3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/380079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic","html_url":"https://github.com/vidakovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-22T05:32:02Z","updated_at":"2024-08-22T05:32:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I don't agree.

This is just hiding the builder pattern for instantiating \"Note\" classes behind these static functions with endless parameters that are really not a good developer experience (especially when reading/reviewing code).

If we just use the builders then everything is just perfectly clear to the reader and we don't have to carry around yet more boilerplate code... my 2 cents.\r\n\r\nThat was my very first thought as well :slightly_smiling_face: The slight adventage with having both might be that the client doesn't need to know the mandatory fields for each \"note type\", instead the factory forces it to do the right thing... \r\n\r\nI'm still not sold it's completely worth the additional LOC though.

Thanks.\r\n\r\n@galovics \r\nIn general, this is to fix an NPE issue we are seeing in some of our test environments in multi-tenant mode. \r\nPotential fix steps:\r\n1) Make partition step StepScoped.\r\n\r\n2) This creates a new instance of the partition step, instead of the default singleton in Spring batch.\r\n\r\n3) Copy values from job execution context into step execution context before partition step.\r\n\r\n4) We then give the business date value to the step context before the step runs, ensuring other jobs/steps are not trying to access the business date value.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/2349282513/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/2351060050","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/3331#issuecomment-2351060050","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/3331","id":2351060050,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAuLPJ86MIlRS","user":{"login":"adamsaghy","id":7602740,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDI3NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7602740?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamsaghy","html_url":"https://github.com/adamsaghy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamsaghy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamsaghy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamsaghy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamsaghy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamsaghy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamsaghy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamsaghy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamsaghy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamsaghy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-14T16:53:02Z","updated_at":"2024-09-14T16:53:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jdailey
