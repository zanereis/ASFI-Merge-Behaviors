The `TestingCluster` is definitely preferable. I don't recall how I ended up with the custom setup instead of the `TestingCluster`.\r\n\r\nI changed the test to wait for another checkpoint after the failed savepoint. I also considered this for the initial PR, but went with mocking in order to test the case that periodic checkpoints were not activated before the cancellation [1]. I think the current variant is a good compromise between completeness and simplicity though.\r\n\r\n[1] As seen in the diff of `JobManager.scala`, we only activate the periodic scheduler after a failed cancellation iff it was activated before cancellation. This case can't be tested robustly with the current approach. We could wait for some time and if no checkpoint arrives in that time consider checkpoints as not accidentally activated, but that's not robust. I would therefore ignore this case if you don't have another idea.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/338165683/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/338169607","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4670#issuecomment-338169607","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4670","id":338169607,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzODE2OTYwNw==","user":{"login":"fpompermaier","id":3776037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzYwMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3776037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpompermaier","html_url":"https://github.com/fpompermaier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpompermaier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpompermaier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpompermaier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpompermaier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpompermaier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpompermaier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpompermaier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpompermaier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpompermaier/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-20T10:29:24Z","updated_at":"2017-10-20T10:29:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Any update on this? reading ORC data would be a very nice feature..","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/338169607/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/338188123","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4254#issuecomment-338188123","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4254","id":338188123,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzODE4ODEyMw==","user":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-20T12:07:32Z","updated_at":"2017-10-20T12:07:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think it's alright that way.

@fhueske  , the pr has been updated according to your comments and also has been rebased to the latest master.

Change the unique key extractor logic of join and use the lexicographic smallest attribute as the common group id.\r\n2. Support time indicator attributes. In fact, we do not need to add special processing logic. Time indicator will be transmitted to the downstream.\r\n3. Add more test cases.\r\n4. Refactor stream join function.

Same would be true for the resolve order, where I would like to have `ConfigOption<String, ResolveOrder>` and it internally does the enum parsing. As it is now I have to do the parsing and exception handling in all places where the config is used.
