Instead, a system property `accumulo.application` is set in [accumulo-env.sh](https://github.com/apache/accumulo/blob/master/assemble/conf/accumulo-env.sh#L93) to something like `tserver_myhost` or `tserver2_myhost` if multiple instances of a service are running.  The property `accumulo.application` is used to configure log filenames and identify the application sending logs to monitor.  Below are uses of it in codebase:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./assemble/conf/accumulo-env.sh:  \"-Daccumulo.application=${cmd}${ACCUMULO_SERVICE_INSTANCE}_$(hostname)\")\r\n./assemble/conf/log4j-monitor.properties:log4j.appender.file.File=${accumulo.log.dir}/${accumulo.application}.log\r\n./assemble/conf/log4j-service.properties:log4j.appender.file.File=${accumulo.log.dir}/${accumulo.application}.log\r\n./assemble/conf/log4j-service.properties:#log4j.appender.audit.File=${accumulo.log.dir}/${accumulo.application}.audit\r\n./server/monitor/src/main/java/org/apache/accumulo/monitor/util/AccumuloMonitorAppender.java:      socketAppender.setApplication(System.getProperty(\"accumulo.application\", \"unknown\"));\r\n```\r\n\r\nI wanted to point the existence of `accumulo.application` but I am not saying it should be used for this use case.

One one hand, it doesn't make sense to bring in a slew of dependencies just for a few annotations.  I have seen full web apps plagued by this in the past.  And since the monitor isn't the heart of Accumulo, I am more hesitant to include something like this.  On the other hand, if it is only one transitive dependency, I can definitely see the benefits it brings through custom code minimization and enhanced end point security, since this type of validation is quite common with web apps.\r\n\r\nI am curious to see what type of errors are thrown by the validation.

I think the issue with WeakHashMap is that they Keys are weak and not the values. So we have to add another layer of WeakRefernce for the values, complicating things.  In our case, it is just a cache and we really want weak values to store the ID objects.\r\n\r\nI also thought of still using WeakHashMap but flipping the keys and values - `WeakHashMap<AbstractId, String>.`  Using ID as the key so it will automatically be weak and then I guess the canonical String as the value.  But then the value is pretty useless.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/322511196/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/322528272","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/292#issuecomment-322528272","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/292","id":322528272,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMjUyODI3Mg==","user":{"login":"milleruntime","id":11872539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODcyNTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11872539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime","html_url":"https://github.com/milleruntime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-15T17:10:27Z","updated_at":"2017-08-15T17:10:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"0f083e0c1793e6093e1fcd2fc18faaf8686e7af1 seems to be the most elegant solution.
