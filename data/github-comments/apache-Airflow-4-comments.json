For copying the file to S3, I figured that since Airflow already has a \"S3-thing\" (i.e., an S3Hook) then I'd try to use it.

be nice to also generalize `__init__` and `get_conn`, though I'd like for them to still use different `conn_id` attributes (as `mysql_conn_id`, `postgres_conn_id`, `presto_conn_id`) because of the way it allows us to define them independently in `default_args` when writing a pipeline. If we were to call them `conn_id` everywhere, we couldn't do this (and it would break backward compatibility).\n\nSo I was thinking there could be a class level attribute called `conn_id_attr`, set to `= conn_id` in the Base class. Then the Base `__init__` and `get_conn` would use `getattr(self.conn_id_attr)` and setattr to refer to the conn_id properly. `__init__` would need to use `**kwargs` to capture arbitrary `.*conn_id` I could push a commit on top of your branch if you don't understand what I'm trying to explain here... \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/122330244/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/122335658","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/137#issuecomment-122335658","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/137","id":122335658,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyMjMzNTY1OA==","user":{"login":"kevinmandich","id":8010735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMTA3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8010735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmandich","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinmandich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmandich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmandich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmandich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmandich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmandich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmandich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmandich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmandich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmandich/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-17T16:38:26Z","updated_at":"2015-07-17T16:38:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Does your `airflow_maintenance` DAG just delete from this table?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/122335658/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/122338889","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/148#issuecomment-122338889","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/148","id":122338889,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyMjMzODg4OQ==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-17T16:49:02Z","updated_at":"2015-07-17T16:49:02Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Unfortunately there's no easy way to do this now.

for the quick response.\n\nTo clarify, we have a dedicated worker listening to a specific queue (airflow worker -q \"specialqueue\").\nNow  the issue here is that every task that goes into the default queue also ends up in the \"specialqueue\" (yes, it isn't just handled by the worker, it really ends up in the redis list for the specialqueue). The way to resolve this is to set different default queues for both workers. That's however not the best solution in case we would like the worker to handle specific tasks as well as the ones targeting the default queue.\n\nCan you explain that behaviour?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/122819072/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/122961339","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/144#issuecomment-122961339","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/144","id":122961339,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyMjk2MTMzOQ==","user":{"login":"r39132","id":581734,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MTczNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/581734?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132","html_url":"https://github.com/r39132","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-20T17:27:45Z","updated_at":"2015-07-20T17:27:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Any updates?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/122961339/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/123000111","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/149#issuecomment-123000111","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/149","id":123000111,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyMzAwMDExMQ==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-20T19:33:30Z","updated_at":"2015-07-20T19:33:30Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"So if you go to the \"Task Details\" view in the UI for a task exhibiting this issue, what queue do you see? \"default\"?\n\nAre you still on `1.1`?
