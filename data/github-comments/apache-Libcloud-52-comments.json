Thanks again.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/751539287/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/751634906","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/1533#issuecomment-751634906","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/1533","id":751634906,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1MTYzNDkwNg==","user":{"login":"dimasmamot","id":12388654,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzg4NjU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12388654?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimasmamot","html_url":"https://github.com/dimasmamot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimasmamot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimasmamot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimasmamot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimasmamot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimasmamot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimasmamot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimasmamot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimasmamot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimasmamot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-28T08:44:41Z","updated_at":"2020-12-28T08:44:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"cool, will add test soon","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/751634906/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/751899296","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/1535#issuecomment-751899296","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/1535","id":751899296,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1MTg5OTI5Ng==","user":{"login":"macfreek","id":31399,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMzk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31399?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/macfreek","html_url":"https://github.com/macfreek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/macfreek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/macfreek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/macfreek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/macfreek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/macfreek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/macfreek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/macfreek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/macfreek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/macfreek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-28T23:53:50Z","updated_at":"2020-12-28T23:53:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'll close this as invalid for now.

One was fixed by making a slight alteration in the code (DurableDNS). Two unit tests seemed erratic to me. I've changed the LuaDNS unit test to make more sense. Finally, the DNSPod behaviour does not make sense to me at all, and is still failing. I've created a separate issue (#1538) to deal with that. I'll add a [WIP] (work in progress) tag there until I've find a good solution there.\r\n\r\n## DurableDNS\r\n\r\nDurableDNSTests.test_list_records() sets both the `ttl` and `extra['ttl']` parameter when creating a new record, but with different values:\r\n\r\nPrevious behaviour:\r\n```\r\nrecord.ttl == '3600'\r\nrecord.extra['ttl'] == 3600\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince this PR only stores the TTL value once, not twice, one of these values has to take precedence.\r\n\r\nBehaviour in original PR:\r\n```\r\nrecord.ttl == '3600'\r\nrecord.extra['ttl'] == '3600'\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, after some considerations, I decided that the value of `record.extra['ttl']` should take precedence over `record.ttl` if both are set.\r\n\r\nBehaviour in final PR:\r\n```\r\nrecord.ttl == 3600\r\nrecord.extra['ttl'] == 3600\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that this PR still only changes how the TTL is stored. The DurableDNSDriver still sets both the `ttl` and `extra['ttl']` parameter when creating a new record, but only casts the later to an `int`, while keeping the former a `str`. That might be a minor bug in the DurableDNSDriver. I have not (yet) fixed that.\r\n\r\n## LuaDNS\r\n\r\nTTL is set to 13, but is [expected to be None when read](https://github.com/apache/libcloud/blob/6b588346083a510396c63b5d18db3012aa083071/libcloud/test/dns/test_luadns.py#L202):\r\n\r\n    def test_create_record_success(self):\r\n        LuadnsMockHttp.type = 'CREATE_RECORD_SUCCESS'\r\n        record = self.driver.create_record(name='test.com.',\r\n                                           zone=self.test_zone,\r\n                                           type='A',\r\n                                           data='127.0.0.1',\r\n                                           extra={'ttl': 13})\r\n        # ...\r\n        self.assertIsNone(record.ttl)\r\n\r\nTo me, this is not very logical. As a user of the library I would expect that the ttl would be set to 13, not be None. So I've updated the unit test with the new behaviour.\r\n\r\n        self.assertEqual(record.ttl, 13)\r\n\r\nOld behaviour:\r\n```\r\nrecord.ttl == None\r\nrecord.extra['ttl'] == 13\r\n```\r\n\r\nNew behaviour:\r\n```\r\nrecord.ttl == 13\r\nrecord.extra['ttl'] == 13\r\n```\r\n\r\n## DNSPod\r\n\r\nThe behaviour of DNSPod seems a bit erratic to me. See #1538 for details.\r\n\r\nThe following unit test now fails:\r\n\r\n    def test_create_record_success(self):\r\n        DNSPodMockHttp.type = 'CREATE_RECORD_SUCCESS'\r\n        record = self.driver.create_record(name='@', zone=self.test_zone,\r\n                                           type='A', data='96.126.115.73',\r\n                                           extra={'ttl': 13,\r\n                                                  'record_line': 'default'})\r\n\r\nOld behaviour\r\n```\r\nrecord.ttl == None\r\nrecord.extra['ttl'] == '600'\r\n```\r\n\r\nNew behaviour\r\n```\r\nrecord.ttl == '600'\r\nrecord.extra['ttl'] == '600'\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere `'600'` is the default TTL for the zone. The extra parameter (with `ttl: 13`) seems to be completely ignored. This PR exposes this erratic behaviour. Hence, the failed unit test. I'm hesitant to fix this particular bug in this PR (since I'm not familiar how the DNSPod expects the TTL), but I don't want to remove the unit test either.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/752286927/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/752412165","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/issues/1536#issuecomment-752412165","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/1536","id":752412165,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1MjQxMjE2NQ==","user":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-30T10:42:06Z","updated_at":"2020-12-30T10:42:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for reporting this.\r\n\r\nI believe ``extra[\"ttl\"]`` was there first, but since specifying \"random\" attributes in ``extra`` dictionary is really a bad and unfriendly API, we decided to \"promote\" that attribute directly as a top-level ``Record.ttl`` object attribute a while back.\r\n\r\nThe idea was to eventually remove ``extra[\"ttl\"]`` support, but we haven't done that yet since it is a breaking changes.\r\n\r\nSo in short - yes, I totally agree with you, there should only be one way and that should be ``Record.ttl`` attribute.

I'll try to add a \"WIP\" (work in progress) tag if I'm not yet happy with the report or PR. You may want to delay your comments till I remove it, to save yourself some time. (And yes, I may sometimes change it even without that tag, once I discover more quirks.)\r\n\r\nI'll have a look if I can make a PR with the suggested change. It might require a significant number of changes in the drivers though.\r\n\r\nAlso, I'll have to think how and when. How to ensure a (mostly) backwards compatible API, and when to make sure this ends up a minor or major release (not a bug fix release).\r\n\r\nA second question is if you would want to consider other (perhaps breaking) changes or clarifications.\r\n\r\nA few things that come to mind are:\r\n* Making the priority an attribute as well. (I'm in doubt. It's fairly common, in use for MX and SRV records, but next thing you know, you'll be adding port, weight, service, and protocol too).\r\n* Align the different `extra` field:\r\n  * In particular zonomi adds a `prio` field, while all other drivers use `priority` as the field name. I prefer consistency here.\r\n  * Align the use of `description` (Google), `comment` (Rackspace) and `notes` (Zerigo).\r\n* Clearly specify the use of trailing dots in both name and data that contain a FQDN. Right now, the name does seems to require a trailing dot (e.g. `www.example.com.`) A data field that requires a FQDN (e.g. MX, NS, PTR or CNAME) do require a trailing dot in DNS itself, but it seems that most API supported here insist that there MUST NOT be a trailing dot.\r\n* Be clear if/how IDN (international domain names) are supported. I kind of suspect that both name and data fields are expected to be punycode-encoded (e.g. `xn--bcher-kva.de.` instead of `bücher.de.`).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/752648458/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/752672124","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/issues/1536#issuecomment-752672124","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/1536","id":752672124,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1MjY3MjEyNA==","user":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-30T15:59:19Z","updated_at":"2020-12-30T15:59:19Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"You are welcome and thank you for your contributions.\r\n\r\nI'm +1 for improving it for other record types as well - handling those things via ``extra`` dictionary is definitely not a great API.\r\n\r\nAs far as implementation wise, I would need to think a bit more about it. For one, I don't think it should live directly on the base ``Record`` class since those attributes are specific to only some record types.\r\n\r\nOne option would be to introduce sub-classes for other common record types which take additional arguments / attributes - so things such as ``RecordMX``, ``RecordPTR``, etc. Base ``Record`` should only contain attribute which are common to all or majority of the record types and then those sub classes can contain record specific attributes.\r\n\r\nThis way we could also relatively easily keep it backward compatible for a while - aka first try to read value from passed in record class instance if it's of a sub-type, otherwise fall back to ``extra`` dict. It would still require quite some work to update all the drivers though. We can also do it incrementally.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/752672124/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/754661526","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/issues/1539#issuecomment-754661526","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/1539","id":754661526,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1NDY2MTUyNg==","user":{"login":"DrissiReda","id":16291156,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjkxMTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16291156?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrissiReda","html_url":"https://github.com/DrissiReda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrissiReda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrissiReda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrissiReda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrissiReda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrissiReda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrissiReda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrissiReda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrissiReda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrissiReda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-05T14:15:36Z","updated_at":"2021-01-05T14:15:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Solved it by setting https://github.com/apache/libcloud/blob/4370a7021c11c1c61afe6470d2baafc093bfa0dd/libcloud/storage/drivers/minio.py#L49 to \r\n`region_name = \"us-east-1\"`\r\n\r\nNot sure if it's worth a PR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/754661526/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/754724306","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/issues/1539#issuecomment-754724306","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/1539","id":754724306,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1NDcyNDMwNg==","user":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-05T15:56:14Z","updated_at":"2021-01-05T15:56:14Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for reporting this.\r\n\r\nI will have a look and try to reproduce this issue (for me, minio driver works out of the box, but could be something related to your configuration -
