We intend to upstream 5 PRs for this work (6 in total but one is already merged), check out the tracking issue here: https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/8482. We currently have up to 4/6 upstream (see here: https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8811). Thanks to GitHub seemingly not supporting incremental patch chains, each subsequent PR also includes all the stuff before it (i.e. PR 4 contains the work from PR 3 and PR 2 as well). If you want a more 'complete' view, you can take a look therefore at the later PRs. It's out intention to have PRs 5 and 6 up by the end of this week. By PR 5, you should be able to run a convolution on the NPU model that we've contributed to CI (in PR 1).\r\n\r\nAlso, just a correction on the RFC you linked. That's for Ethos-N, a different class of NPU that we have also added support for in TVM (mostly last year). The RFC for Ethos-U is here: https://github.com/apache/tvm-rfcs/pull/11.

great!\r\nWe have ever implemented a similar approach to put a optimized tvm graph runtime back to TensorFlow and Pytorch through custom ops. For some reason we're not able to split those codes out from another project. Glad to have this feature in main branch!\r\n\r\ncc @minminsun ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/905338556/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/905352332","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8835#issuecomment-905352332","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8835","id":905352332,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM419pSM","user":{"login":"Mousius","id":4933431,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MzM0MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4933431?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius","html_url":"https://github.com/Mousius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-25T09:51:24Z","updated_at":"2021-08-25T09:51:24Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hmm, something weird is occurring here, unsure why those tests didn't run for me locally - but debugging `test_any.py` a bit I ran `tvm::Dump(per_target_module_)` and got (removed function body for brevity):\r\n```\r\n{\r\nllvm -keys=cpu -link-params=0: IRModule({GlobalVar(intrp_fused_add): PrimFunc([placeholder, placeholder, T_add]) attrs={\"from_legacy_te_schedule\": (bool)1, \"global_symbol\": \"intrp_fused_add\", \"tir.noalias\": (bool)1} {}\r\n}), \r\nllvm -keys=cpu -link-params=0: IRModule({GlobalVar(shape_func_add): PrimFunc([placeholder, placeholder, _broadcast_shape_func]) attrs={\"from_legacy_te_schedule\": (bool)1, \"global_symbol\": \"shape_func_add\", \"tir.noalias\": (bool)1} {}\r\n})}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should be gated in `GetLoweredFunctions`, with these lines (these are ran twice, once for normal  cache and once for shape cache):\r\n```\r\n      if (!lowered_functions.count(target)) {\r\n        lowered_functions.Set(target, IRModule(Map<GlobalVar, BaseFunc>({})));\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      lowered_functions[target]->Update(lowered_func->cached_func->funcs);\r\n```\r\nAnd only create a single `IRModule` per `target`, this indicates the `Map` is instead creating many keys even for the single `Target` it was passed in LowerTE (i.e. same `Target` object, I assume copied), unsure why this isn't breaking more.\r\n\r\nThis also means I was wrong about the `Target(\"ext_dev\")` comparison, my apologies :crying_cat_face:.

The original intend of the code is that the pass should return a new module if necessary, but can perform copyon write optimization if needed. This change would make us unable to perform the copyon write optimization. We probably need to fix the problematic passes behavior instead of this one.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/905589054/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/905680014","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8847#issuecomment-905680014","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8847","id":905680014,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM41-5SO","user":{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-25T16:17:16Z","updated_at":"2021-08-25T16:17:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I am curious too.

More specifically, we can do:\r\n- Introduce `TargetStrHash` and `TargetStrEqual`, and put them temporarily somewhere in `src/relay/backend` folder, so that it won't be widely seen as public APIs\r\n- Add a note there that these two methods will be removed in the future, so that other developers could notice\r\n- Switch the `tvm::runtime::Map` to `std::unordered_map<Target, ..., TargetStrHash, TargetStrEqual>`, so that we are using the customized hash/equality methods\r\n- In the future, we can safely remove dependency to these two methods after the Target Map is completely removed :-)\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? Thanks a lot!\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/905745045/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/905781697","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8382#issuecomment-905781697","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8382","id":905781697,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM41_SHB","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-25T18:41:21Z","updated_at":"2021-08-25T18:41:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks @mikepapadim !
