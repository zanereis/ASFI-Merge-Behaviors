Indeed I see 2 main points here:\n1. How to guarantee that the end-user do not fetch a massive amount of data from RDD to the Driver programe, e.g. add some mechanism to limit the amount of fetched data for display\n2. Normalize the `showRDD()` and `displayAsTable()` code to put them at the same place and not spread over\n\nSo, my answers:\n\n1.Default limit for fetched data\n\n For this we can take the same approach as the one taken by `showRdd()`: \n\n``` scala\n  val defaultMaxLimit = 10000 \n\n  def displayAsTable(maxLimit: Long, columnsLabel: String*) {...}\n\n  def displayAsTable(columnsLabel: String*) {\n      displayAsTable(defaultMaxLimit, columnsLabel)\n  }\n```\n\n The above solution works, but I propose another approach. In my last commit, the `displayAsTable()` method also works for plain **Scala collection** so I suggest to remove the support from RDD. If the end-user want to use `displayAsTable()`, **they must convert their RDD first to a Scala collection**. In some way, we force the end-user to call either `collect()` or `take(n)` **explicitly**.\n\nExample:\n\n``` scala\nrdd\n.map(...)\n.filter(...)\n.take(30) // User responsibility\n.displayAsTable(...)\n```\n\n This way, we put the responsibility of collecting data explicitly on the end-user, no surprise, what do you think ?\n1. Normalize the `showRDD()` and `displayAsTable()` code \n\nI had a look into the **[ZeppelinContext](https://github.com/apache/incubator-zeppelin/blob/master/spark/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/spark/ZeppelinContext.java)** code and basically it is dealing with Scala code in Java. What we can do is:\n\n a. either put the `displayAsTable()` method inside this **`ZeppelinContext`** class and code everything in Java but then we loose the power of Scala implicit conversion. We'll need to do:\n\n```\nval collection = rdd.map(...).filter(...).take(10)\nz.displayAsTable(collection,\"Header1\",\"Header2\",...)\n```\n\n b. or we port the code of **`ZeppelinContext`** in Scala directly so that both `displayAsTable()` and `showRDD()` are written directly in **Scala**. It would make sense because lots of the code in this class is dealing already with Scala code and it would avoid us converting back and forth between Java and Scala:\n\nI volunteer to port this class from Java to Scala (with unit tests of course).

Here's summary of changes.\n\n##### Move spark specific dependency configuration from pom.xml -> spark/pom.xml\n\nBecause of spark specific dependency configuration were inside of common parent pom.xml, all other interpreter were influenced by this. Flink is one of example that conflict dependency library version with the version spark uses. This PR moves spark specific configuration from pom.xml to spark/pom.xml\n\n##### Removal of huge dependencyManagement block\n\ndependencyManagement block introduced to pom.xml for resolving dependency conflict between Zeppelin and Spark. However, since Zeppelin changed to run interpreter as separate process, we don't have massive dependency conflict. So most dependency management blocks are just removed.\n\n##### Automated test against standalone spark cluster.\n\n   Incompatible version of dependency can raise error especially when spark runs against spark cluster. While this PR brings big changes to dependency, i've made our CI (travis) test against spark standalone cluster to make sure Zeppelin runs with spark cluster.\n\n##### Automated test multiple profile spark-1.3, spark-1.2, spark-1.1\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/108795845/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/109009843","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/84#issuecomment-109009843","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/84","id":109009843,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwOTAwOTg0Mw==","user":{"login":"praagarw","id":6813477,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MTM0Nzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6813477?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/praagarw","html_url":"https://github.com/praagarw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praagarw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praagarw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praagarw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praagarw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praagarw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praagarw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praagarw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praagarw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praagarw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-04T18:58:16Z","updated_at":"2015-06-04T19:51:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Travis CI logs suggest that the failure is not cause of my changes.

The other thing I have to mention that services are singletons (https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide#singletons), so you'll be better off returning an object instead of using `this`.\nE.g.\n\n``` javascript\nthis.deleteNotebook = function(noteId) {}\nthis.getNotebookList = function() {}\n```\n\nwould become\n\n``` javascript\nreturn {\n  deleteNotebook = function() {},\n  getNotebookList = function() {}\n}\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/111350416/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/111353057","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/56#issuecomment-111353057","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/56","id":111353057,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExMTM1MzA1Nw==","user":{"login":"corneadoug","id":710411,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDQxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/710411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug","html_url":"https://github.com/corneadoug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-12T04:30:26Z","updated_at":"2015-06-12T04:33:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yeah, but like your link show, services while being a singleton (just like everything in angular) are usually use as public functions only (transformation functions mainly) and do not hold any variables.\n\nSo I follow most of the examples on factory/ServiceFactory/Service differences and use this.myFunction on Services only.
