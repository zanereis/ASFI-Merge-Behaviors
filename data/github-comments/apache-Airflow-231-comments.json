Why would one want `TriggerDagRunOperator` and yet another `dag` if there is a simple solution to ensure one and only one processing pipeline is running within a `dag`? What about the visibility (I am sure this is an important aspect in data processing) if `TriggerDagRunOperator` does not trigger the other dag? With this operator, I can simply be certain that the critical data processing pipelines are not overwriting each other without any complicated dag(s) and also not consuming the resources (cpu, disk space) if they do not need to. In the event of an outage, I can be certain that with `catchup=True` dag configuration, any missed data processing pipeline can resume with 100% of confidence.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/499530408/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/499535399","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5339#issuecomment-499535399","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5339","id":499535399,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5OTUzNTM5OQ==","user":{"login":"aoen","id":1592778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTI3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1592778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoen","html_url":"https://github.com/aoen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-06T15:07:51Z","updated_at":"2019-06-06T15:07:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Good catch Sumit!

Sorry it took me this long to get back to this.\r\n\r\nI've added a test as you suggested and also refactored the `AWSAthenaOperator`'s test suite a bit:\r\n- the Athena query ID is now stored in a separate constant, so that it can be easily compared in tests\r\n- the Athena query ID is now a random UUID rather than `'1234'`\r\n- the test suite now contains a simple DAG, which is necessary for testing XComs\r\n\r\nIf you would like to try the changes out yourself, it should be as easy as running\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./run_unit_tests.sh tests.contrib.operators.test_aws_athena_operator:TestAWSAthenaOperator -s --logging-level=DEBUG\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease do let me know if there is anything else I can do to get this to \"mergeable\"

Currently pylint does not have way to decide which modules should have docstrings and which should not :(. We have an open issue for that https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4751 - which we might address by PR to pylint, but for now we think it's a small inconvenience and having docstrings for most modules makes sense.

Typically business logic code is very hard to debug and understand - because others don't have the context you had while writing the code.\r\n\r\nIMO this migration is a perfect example of this - the number of chars is raised. If it ever turns out to be an issue and somebody else would look at the code, they don't see any explanation in the code stating why the number was raised and why 256 was chosen. Only after reading your JIRA issue do I understand why these choices were made, which are perfectly fine. Unfortunately, not everybody explains the what and why in their Git commit/PR/JIRA issue.\r\n\r\nReading the Airflow code base, there are a lot of such examples of undocumented logic, so now that we are in the process of adding Pylint I prefer not to lower the boundaries just because it's inconvenient. If you'd write a DAG at your work and you're the only person maintaining the thing, I wouldn't really be bothered, but Airflow is software used and developed by many people around the world so I strongly prefer to have consistently documented code.\r\n\r\nSorry for the wall of text, hope you understand 😃
