are decreasing the code coverage with these changes. especially with interface changes and new methods, I think unittests should be there.\n\nThis is not the final state of this code. It will go through multiple iterations with different developers touching it and there should be a check that the code you have written behaves in the expected way even after those changes.\n\nfor unittests, you could mock jobMgr to return failed jobs with snapshots(and some other jobs as well) in different states and then assert what you are expecting the code to do actually happens. There can be some cases where the deserialization might fail etc. you could test those cases as well. \n\nFor example, the current code will fail with NPE if jobMgr.findFailureAsyncJobs returns null. I dont know if it can, there is not javadoc describing its return value. It will be good to write a unit test for this case and assert that you code doesnt cause system error if that happens.\n\nYou could also add marvin test case to cover this scenario. Basically, there should be an automated way to test the code you have written.\n\nAlso, please post the test results(manual or automatic) you already executed.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/139980724/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/139986534","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/816#issuecomment-139986534","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/816","id":139986534,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzOTk4NjUzNA==","user":{"login":"miguelaferreira","id":4670993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NzA5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4670993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira","html_url":"https://github.com/miguelaferreira","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-14T07:45:25Z","updated_at":"2015-09-14T07:45:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @mike-tutkowski \n\nI've skimmed through the code in this PR and I saw quite a lot of nice modifications.
