Pardon me if you already know what I will tell.\r\n\r\nI started to try out Netbeans 12.3 + Gradle 7 + Java 16 and the result was very bad. The machine was fresh and there was no Java nor Netbeans ever installed before. So I installed Java 16 and then just downloaded and installed Netbeans 12.3.\r\n\r\nI got a small project in Gradle and tried to build it. My first result was a silent NullPointerExceptions somewhere inside Netbeans when it tried to access some array in order to build the project, with the output panel blank. If you are interested, I can backtrack to this point in order to reproduce it.\r\n\r\nAnyway, trying to make it work, I manually downloaded Gradle 7.0 and setted it in the Options > Java > Gradle setting.\r\n\r\nThen, Netbeans tries to prime-loading the project with its internally downloaded Gradle 6.7 regardless of any setting that I to try to do to force the use of Gradle 7.0. This results in Gradle instantly crashing with unsupported classfile format because Gradle 6.7 can't recognize Java 16.\r\n\r\nTo make it worse, when Netbeans fails the prime-loading, it alerts that the project is unloadable due to errors and fallbacks to an unchangeable \"-source 5\" which makes the java files are full of spurious errors about uses of diamonds, lambdas, records and a lot of other stuffs.\r\n\r\nThe result so far, is that Netbeans 12.3 + Gradle 7 + Java 16 is pretty much an unusable combination. I lost some hours trying to make this work and after searching a lot on Google, I just landed here.\r\n\r\nSo, I just wanted to inform you about the experience in order to avoid that some of those cases are missed. And also, to tell you that this problem is surely seen in the wild and are biting some random people out there like me. Anyway, keep the good work!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/829620641/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/829645575","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2924#issuecomment-829645575","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/2924","id":829645575,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyOTY0NTU3NQ==","user":{"login":"sdedic","id":26788611,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg4NjEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26788611?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic","html_url":"https://github.com/sdedic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-29T22:51:12Z","updated_at":"2021-04-29T22:51:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@victorwss Thanks for your feedback.

To act as a canary, and not just a cause of intermittent bugs for some developers (who may or may not report the problem, or may even just give up), problems like these would need to be triggered as part of the automated Windows build on Travis.\r\n\r\nIn fact I'm curious why it doesn't trigger in the Travis Windows builds. I suspect someone explicitly set UTF-8 as the OS-level encoding on the Windows CI images. That might well be a good idea, except then the build does not reproduce problems that occurs for Windows developers who do not change the default encoding on their machines. One could argue that the Travis build should be explicitly set to Windows-1252, to match Windows developers' typical configuration. This would rightly generate some debate, though...\r\n\r\nSo I'd prefer to keep the patch as is for now, but I wouldn't be opposed to adding back a canary later if the Travis builds are adjusted so that these kinds of bugs actually cause failures.\r\n\r\n(Also, by the way, still a big thank you to @jglick for the original unrelated patch that was coincidentally involved here.
