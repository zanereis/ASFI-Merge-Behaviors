I am facing a similar issue.\r\n\r\nAIUI the current permission systems are about access to dashboards, charts and data-sources. That's a level above what we want (i.e we want to have granular permissions based access to the data *within* those charts).\r\n\r\nHere is an initial thought on how maybe superset could be patched to make this work:\r\n\r\n1) When creating users, have a set of arbitrary key/values that you can populate for that user. It could be things like 'user_id', 'department' etc. The point here is to add key/values that we would want to later filter on.\r\n2) When creating Charts, where the 'Add Filter' is, have an 'Add User Filter' option. This might look the same as the regular Filter option, except the value would be a key that we had previously entered as the user. It might look something like storing a bindparam for later interpolation.\r\n3) `Table.get_sqla_query()` would then build our query just like it does now, although in addition to a `filter` key, it could also look for `user_filter` (or whatever), and would do a `getattr(flask.g.user, user_filter.val)` or similar to get the user specific value that we are filtering against.\r\n\r\nYou'd obviously have to consider what to do if the User doesn't have the attribute, as well as other possible complexities I haven't thought of. \r\n\r\nIf those who know Superset better than I think this is a reasonable approach I'd be happy to get on and write a patch, because as much as I'd like to use Superset, without this kind of feature it's of limited use to me :( \r\n\r\n@mistercrunch As to the security around the WHERE clause, is it possible for the user to pass in arbitrary filters to a GET call? If it isn't possible, and if they cannot modify the Chart then the WHERE clause should be secure...right ?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/413528011/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/413570557","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/4250#issuecomment-413570557","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/4250","id":413570557,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMzU3MDU1Nw==","user":{"login":"MartinThoma","id":1658117,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTgxMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1658117?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinThoma","html_url":"https://github.com/MartinThoma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinThoma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinThoma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinThoma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinThoma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinThoma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinThoma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinThoma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinThoma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinThoma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-16T14:44:02Z","updated_at":"2018-08-16T14:44:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"(People coming here via Google might be interested in [this stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/51872791/562769))","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/413570557/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/413589256","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/5583#issuecomment-413589256","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/5583","id":413589256,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMzU4OTI1Ng==","user":{"login":"jeffreythewang","id":3317634,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTc2MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3317634?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreythewang","html_url":"https://github.com/jeffreythewang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreythewang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreythewang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreythewang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreythewang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreythewang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreythewang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreythewang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreythewang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreythewang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-16T15:38:01Z","updated_at":"2018-08-16T15:38:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"My bad.

I agree that some of the terminology surrounding the feature needs to be defined more clearly since there's some ambiguity around the term \"published\". You hit the nail on the head when you said that **My understanding is that unpublished dashboards are viewable, but less discoverable** – which is further bolstered by your distinction of _prod vs in-progress_. I think the comment about migration (which mentioned that dashboards would all of the sudden be gone) was referring to the visibility of them within these list views but they would not actually be gone or become truly unviewable. With that in mind I've considered some of the excellent points you've made and here's what I think:\r\n\r\n### Welcome List & CRUD View List for Dashboards\r\nYou mentioned as a part of your understanding that the visibility of the dashboard will change on the `/welcome` page but not the crud view. This wasn't quite my intention since when I was developing the feature these both used the same `/dashboardmodelview/list` endpoint and displayed the same dashboards. However I think it's a good idea to show admins all of the dashboards on the crud list view and to include a column of whether or not it's published for filtering. The alternative would make it so that even admins wouldn't be able to see these dashboards unless they performed a query which is less than ideal. \r\n\r\nRight now I say that only admins should be able to see all dashboards because I believe this view is used more frequently for finding dashboards than `/welcome` (considering I'm not aware of a way to return to `/welcome` except by setting the URL specifically). If the Superset icon in the top left returned the user to this view instead of the profile I would say it should affect just the welcome page and not the CRUD view but since most people use the CRUD view to find dashboards once they're in the application I think the feature should de-clutter that view as well. Perhaps the _profile_ button under the human icon in the top-right can become the `/profile` page and then an edit button on that page can take you to `/users/userinfo`? It seems like this may be more intuitive even without this feature we're discussing haha.\r\n\r\n###   Displaying and Altering the Published Status\r\nI think you make a great point about the eye icon being a bit misleading and a bit too subtle. I think a better solution might be something like a [_draft_] badge next to the title of the dashboard (possibly with a hover-over tooltip) which indicates a few things:\r\n\r\n- The dashboard they're viewing will not show up in the list of dashboards, they should favorite it to see it in that list along with the others\r\n- The elements used in the dashboard are tentative and subject to change\r\n- Users should consider whether or not it is okay for them to share the dashboard before doing so\r\n\r\nThis indicator seems like it would make the intention of the feature much more understandable.\r\n \r\nAs for altering the status, I think you're totally right that it makes more sense to put this in the actions dropdown especially if we forgo the icon which was both the indicator and the toggle.\r\n\r\n### The Way Forward\r\nHere's a couple of action items which I think are appropriate after this discussion for me to work on:\r\n\r\n- [x] Replace the eye icon with a [draft] badge of sorts next to the title of unpublished dashboards.\r\n- [x] Add ability to toggle published status in the action dropdown menu \r\n- [x] Add published field to CRUD listing of dashboards for sorting / filtering\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think and thanks again for your consideration :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/413696255/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/413698417","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/5634#issuecomment-413698417","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/5634","id":413698417,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMzY5ODQxNw==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-16T22:03:26Z","updated_at":"2018-08-22T04:33:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/5634?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#5634](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/5634?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/commit/bcc0954bb9d23f40abcf3a04fd28cf5eb18e4ffd?src=pr&el=desc) will **increase** coverage by `0.01%`.\n> The diff coverage is `100%`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/5634/graphs/tree.svg?height=150&src=pr&token=KsB0fHcx6l&width=650)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/5634?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@            Coverage Diff             @@\n##           master    #5634      +/-   ##\n==========================================\n+ Coverage   63.44%   63.45%   +0.01%     \n==========================================\n  Files         360      360              \n  Lines       22953    22958       +5     \n  Branches     2558     2557       -1     \n==========================================\n+ Hits        14562    14568       +6     \n+ Misses       8376     8375       -1     \n  Partials       15       15\n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/5634?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [superset/assets/src/explore/controls.jsx](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/5634/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-c3VwZXJzZXQvYXNzZXRzL3NyYy9leHBsb3JlL2NvbnRyb2xzLmpzeA==) | `46.26% <ø> (+0.34%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [superset/assets/src/explore/visTypes.jsx](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/5634/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-c3VwZXJzZXQvYXNzZXRzL3NyYy9leHBsb3JlL3Zpc1R5cGVzLmpzeA==) | `57.14% <ø> (ø)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [superset/dataframe.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/5634/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-c3VwZXJzZXQvZGF0YWZyYW1lLnB5) | `94.91% <100%> (+0.27%)` | :arrow_up: |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/5634?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** -

This is meant to run _exactly once_ every hour.\r\n* `email_reports.schedule_hourly` goes through all the scheduled entries and figures out if any job needs to be executed in that particular hour.\r\n* If there are tasks that need running, `email_reports.schedule_hourly` will schedule them with celery (using the `eta` argument).\r\n\r\nI hope this clears up your questions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/413714805/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/413715654","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/5294#issuecomment-413715654","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/5294","id":413715654,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMzcxNTY1NA==","user":{"login":"mahendra","id":115988,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTk4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/115988?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahendra","html_url":"https://github.com/mahendra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahendra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahendra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahendra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahendra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahendra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahendra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahendra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahendra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahendra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-16T23:38:15Z","updated_at":"2018-08-16T23:38:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@mmuru @villebro @nik-crisp @sashank @YHGui @betodealmeida @mistercrunch \r\n\r\nThank you all for your review comments and testing.

A few years ago, I had designed a similar system for doing reports. Let me explain why it would fail here.\r\n\r\n1. Handling change of schedules is very complex. Celery beat works by mostly having a static set of crontab schedules for it's jobs. It is not well designed to handle dynamically changing schedules. If a user changes the schedule for an email delivery, we have to update beat to cancel an old schedule and then install a new schedule. I don't know if beat supports something like this. Even if it does, we will have to keep track of a beat's internal db reference with a dashboar's/slice's schedule (in another table).  My approach is simpler (IMHO). You use celerybeat to run a job once an hour (a static config) and everything else is dynamic. The user can install/update/delete email reports and we don't care. We use the latest crontab entries for each job as-is.\r\n\r\n2. No hard dependency on beat. In the future, we can use frameworks like luigi or a simple Unix crontab script to invoke the hourly job. (and get rid of beat)\r\n\r\n3. At [Affirm](https://tech.affirm.com/), we are heavy users of celery and run millions of celery tasks every day, but we have experienced a lot of difficulty in running and managing beat jobs - specially the ones which need dynamic schedules. We run just one beat job on production now which will be deprecated soon.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/414027588/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/414028918","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/5294#issuecomment-414028918","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/5294","id":414028918,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNDAyODkxOA==","user":{"login":"mmuru","id":11397834,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzk3ODM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11397834?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmuru","html_url":"https://github.com/mmuru","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmuru/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmuru/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmuru/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmuru/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmuru/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmuru/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmuru/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmuru/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmuru/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-18T03:27:18Z","updated_at":"2018-08-18T03:27:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@mahendra: Thanks for the fix and the detailed explanation on the celery beat scheduling implementation.

Roughly speaking you need to do the following:\r\n\r\n1. Create a custom view and override the `/superset/explore_json` endpoint\r\n2. Modify the Viz `query_obj()` method to include any additional filtering you want.\r\n3. Import the custom view via the FLASK_APP_MUTATOR.\r\n\r\nIt looks something like this.\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom flask import g\r\nfrom flask_appbuilder import expose\r\nfrom superset import appbuilder\r\nfrom superset.views.core import Superset, log_this, has_access_api\r\n\r\nclass MyCustomView(Superset):\r\n\r\n    @log_this\r\n    @has_access_api\r\n    @expose('/explore_json/<datasource_type>/<datasource_id>/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])\r\n    @expose('/explore_json/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])\r\n    def explore_json(self, *args, **kwargs):\r\n        \"\"\" This is a copy of the method definition from Superset \"\"\"\r\n        return super(MyCustomView, self).explore_json(*args, **kwargs)\r\n\r\n    def get_viz(self, *args, **kwargs):\r\n        \"\"\" Return the Vizualisation object\r\n\r\n        get_viz() overrides the Superset.get_viz() method\r\n        so it can wrap it and alter the filter pattern\r\n        that it produces. This is so we can filter\r\n        viz objects by whatever we want.\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        viz_obj = super(DAView, self).get_viz(*args, **kwargs)\r\n        # The viz_obj has a query_obj() method which will be called\r\n        # and filters added before being fetched from the DB.\r\n        # We want to wrap this function, so when called we add our own\r\n        # filtering\r\n        def wrapped(f):\r\n            def inner(*args, **kwargs):\r\n                query_obj = f(*args, **kwargs)\r\n                # If we want here we can check the dashboard first \r\n                dashboard = urllib.urlparse(request.headers['referer']).path\r\n                if dashboard == '/superset/dashboard/dashboardX'/:\r\n                    # Then filter by username\r\n                    query_obj['filter'].append({'val': f'{g.user.username}', 'op': '==', 'col': 'username'})\r\n                return query_obj\r\n            return inner\r\n        viz_obj.query_obj = wrapped(viz_obj.query_obj)\r\n        return viz_obj\r\n\r\n# Here we are making sure that any calls to explore_json()\r\n# will call our custom view, thus giving us control of the response\r\nfor rule in appbuilder.app.url_map.iter_rules():\r\n    if rule.rule == '/superset/explore_json/':\r\n        rule.endpoint = 'MyCustomView.explore_json'\r\n\r\nappbuilder.app.url_map.update()\r\nappbuilder.add_view_no_menu(DAView)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen in your superset `config.py` file add the following:\r\n```\r\n\r\ndef import_stuff(app):\r\n    from my_app import views\r\nFLASK_APP_MUTATOR = import_stuff\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere the `views` module has our previosuly defined `MyCustomView` class etc.\r\n\r\nI tried this on 0.26 and it seemed to work fine.

It's a bit beyond the scope of this SIP (another one will be posted shortly that describes this in depth) but we are hoping to refactor the frontend code into a series of NPM packages, for the time being you could imagine `@superset/connection` (for data-related components) and `@superset/charts`(for chart related components) packages. You could then import individual Superset visualizations or a component we're thinking of as a `\"<SuperChart id={123} />\"` component that could take a chart id and render any vis type.\r\n\r\nAs for exposing controls like group bys and filters in another application, here's an overview of some different usage scenarios we have thought about with associated components. If the app using the embeddable charts knows about column metadata, it can create the appropriate group bys and filters that then affect the query for the chart. (note this doesn't use the filter widget specifically, the other application would need to write the logic for controls; in the long-run we would also hope to create `@superset/controls` package to expose these types of controls out of the box)\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2018-08-20 at 10 02 27 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4496521/44355008-33f04480-a460-11e8-847d-dda18eb15936.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/414390639/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/414405870","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/5669#issuecomment-414405870","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/5669","id":414405870,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNDQwNTg3MA==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-20T17:53:33Z","updated_at":"2018-08-21T00:41:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/5669?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#5669](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/5669?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/commit/2d23ae1065cd52770ace6cd072aebb74fe195394?src=pr&el=desc) will **decrease** coverage by `0.01%`.\n> The diff coverage is `0%`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/5669/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&token=KsB0fHcx6l&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/5669?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@            Coverage Diff             @@\n##           master    #5669      +/-   ##\n==========================================\n- Coverage   63.49%   63.47%   -0.02%     \n==========================================\n  Files         360      360              \n  Lines       22910    22916       +6     \n  Branches     2551     2550       -1     \n==========================================\n  Hits        14547    14547              \n- Misses       8348     8354       +6     \n  Partials       15       15\n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/5669?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [superset/assets/src/explore/visTypes.jsx](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/5669/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-c3VwZXJzZXQvYXNzZXRzL3NyYy9leHBsb3JlL3Zpc1R5cGVzLmpzeA==) | `57.14% <ø> (ø)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [superset/assets/src/explore/controls.jsx](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/5669/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-c3VwZXJzZXQvYXNzZXRzL3NyYy9leHBsb3JlL2NvbnRyb2xzLmpzeA==) | `45.92% <ø> (ø)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [superset/assets/src/visualizations/word\\_cloud.js](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/5669/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-c3VwZXJzZXQvYXNzZXRzL3NyYy92aXN1YWxpemF0aW9ucy93b3JkX2Nsb3VkLmpz) | `0% <0%> (ø)` | :arrow_up: |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/5669?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/5669?src=pr&el=footer).

For instance the deckgl visualizations zooming/panning set the ViewportControl. The adaptor function needs to receive/dispatch it.\r\n\r\nTo make this frontend visualization plugin possible, we'll need to figure out how to get rid of the visualization-specific backend code in `viz.py` over time, to make sure that visualizations plugins are fully defined as Javascript. One easy step forward is to move the backend's `query_obj` code, which takes `form_data` as input and returns a query object (simple logic). The `get_data` method is probably harder to migrate to the backend (takes a dataframe and returns nested objects), but it can probably be generalized quite a bit, so that it's not visualization-specific as much as ordering pandas-like operations on the result set.\r\n\r\nSo I'm wondering where these new frontend methods should live. I'm guessing you were thinking about export the adaptor and using this as an the interface between `chart` and the visualization plugin. Now I'm thinking we may want to export a more complex object.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport const visualization = {\r\n  adaptor,\r\n  queryGenerator: (formData) => {\r\n    return generateQuery(formData);\r\n  },\r\n  dataframeOperations: (formData) => (['pivot_table',  { cols: [formData.cols], rows: formData.groupby }]),\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how to model the query vs dataframe operations, should it be incorporate into the query, or made into its own thing. Clearly on the backend we need two abstractions as one is used to interact with connectors (querying) and the other applies to all connectors (dataframe transformation).\r\n\r\nI also wonder whether we could expose most of the pandas API from the frontend by doing a bit of magic, where the `dataframeOperations` above would somehow do something like `getattr(df, command)(**props)` on the backend.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/414512619/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/414515664","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/5039#issuecomment-414515664","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/5039","id":414515664,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNDUxNTY2NA==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-21T01:05:39Z","updated_at":"2018-08-21T01:05:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This is interesting, can we add few lines in `superset/config.py`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Chrome allows up to 6 open connections per domain at a time.
