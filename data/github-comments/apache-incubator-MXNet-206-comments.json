A list of frontend changes in this PR\r\n\r\nNote: rsp is short for row_sparse\r\n- Frontend changes: \r\n  NDArrayBase\r\n  -> NDArray\r\n  -> SparseNDArray\r\n  -> CSRNDArray / RowSparseNDArray \r\n\r\n- All `NDArray(NDArrayHandle(handle))` is replaced by `_ndarray_cls(NDArrayHandle(handle))` to construct NDArray/CSRNDArray/RowSparseNDArray based on storage type\r\n- Added `to_rsp`, `to_csr` and `to_dense` method for NDArray storage type conversion\r\n- Implemented `zeros`, `load`, `save` for SparseNDArray, functions are moved to ndarray_utils \r\n- `SparseNDArray` only supports [:] for assignment\r\n- support `__getitem__` with rows for CSRNDArray, but not for RowSparseNDArray\r\n- `__iadd__`, `__imul__`, `__idiv___`, `__isub__` is not supported for SparseNDArray. `__add__`, `__mul__`, etc are inherited from NDArray\r\n- `at`, `reshape`, `broadcast_to`, `T` not supported for SparseNDArray yet\r\n- user is able to retrieve aux (dense) NDArray via `indices`, `values` and `indptr` properties (`indptr` is only available for CSRNArray)\r\n- `Variable` has one more attr called `__storage_type__`\r\n- List of operators implemented (CPU only - many of them shares templated implementation but don't have great performance on GPU):\r\n  `elemwise_add` (row_sparse)\r\n  `cast_storage` (csr<->dense, rsp<->dense, forward only) \r\n  `dot` (csr dot dense, csr.T dot dense, csr dot row_sparse, csr.T dot row_sparse) \r\n  `sparse_embedding` (does the same thing as dot, expect weight is auto-allocated)\r\n  `sparse_retain` (see https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/pull/5800/files#diff-1b545c728261fd4bf9d82d1340ea7a63R275) \r\n  `sgd_update` & `sgd_mom_update` (only updating weights with non-zeros rows in gradient, when either weight or gradient is row_sparse)\r\n- `LibSVMIter` reads libsvm format input and output `CSRNDArray`  \r\n- `NDArrayIter` can accept `CSRNDArray` as input \r\n- kvstore is able to initialize `row_sparse` weight\r\n\r\nTODO list\r\n- [ ] kvstore API needs to adopt changes in #6765\r\n- [ ] remove infer_storage_type python interface \r\n- [ ] Add test for multi-dimensional RowSparse NDArray\r\n- [x] remove shared memory `_slice` for SparseNDArray, always perform slice and assign\r\n- [ ] merge unary & binary operators from Chris's branch\r\n- [ ] bug fix for `NDArrayIter` and `LibSVMIter` (https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin/mxnet/issues/110 https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin/mxnet/issues/98)\r\n- [ ] Plus the ones I mentioned in the previous review\r\n- [ ] refactor ReduceSumCPUExSerial and ReduceSumCPUExparallel\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/310431712/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/310434516","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/6765#issuecomment-310434516","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/6765","id":310434516,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMDQzNDUxNg==","user":{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-22T16:35:35Z","updated_at":"2017-06-22T16:35:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"done","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/310434516/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/310436486","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/6753#issuecomment-310436486","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/6753","id":310436486,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMDQzNjQ4Ng==","user":{"login":"piiswrong","id":568948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODk0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong","html_url":"https://github.com/piiswrong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-22T16:43:15Z","updated_at":"2017-06-22T16:43:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"You
