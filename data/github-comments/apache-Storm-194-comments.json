we can make this work if we move <tt>backtype.storm.command.shell-submission</tt> to the <tt>storm-clojure</tt> package.  Then we have the storm-clojure jar with dependencies placed in a special directory as part of the storm distribution, and have it play games when it submits a topology that will try to include storm-clojure and dependencies in the classpath for the workers.</p>\n\n<p>To me that sounds like too much work to maintain compatibility so I would propose that instead we put up two pull requests one to deprecate shell-submission in 1.0, and another to remove it completely in 2.0.  Unless that is someone want to volunteer to do the work I outlined above.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612662021/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/197343790","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1136#issuecomment-197343790","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1136","id":197343790,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5NzM0Mzc5MA==","user":{"login":"vesense","id":6711230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MTEyMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6711230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense","html_url":"https://github.com/vesense","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-16T13:59:51Z","updated_at":"2016-03-16T13:59:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"cc
