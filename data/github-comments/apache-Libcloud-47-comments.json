That's what I came up with - 428c3b63.\r\n\r\nFor some reason, mypy doesn't recognize driver classes (e.g. ``EC2NodeDriver`` to be a subclass of ``NodeDriver``), so the following doesn't work:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nEC2 = get_driver(Provider.EC2)  # type: Type[EC2NodeDriver]\r\nRackspace = get_driver(Provider.RACKSPACE)  # type: Type[RackspaceNodeDriver]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe approach I used is not ideal, but I confirmed it works.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure why it doesn't recognize it (I didn't dig in too much yet), I assume it's something to do with scoping.\r\n\r\nMight even need to open mypy issue / question about it, but I assume they will come back to us with that our code already relies on too much \"magic\" and meta programming
