@twalthr, having JVM heap size configurable is definitely a great benefit. Just to clarify, this is only changing the Client JVM heap size, correct? I am assuming this is mainly for manipulating large size data when retrieving results from the query. \r\n\r\nI think adding it to `flink-conf.yaml` should be fine. There are already specific configurations commented out for components like Kerberos, ZK, etc. which makes adding a specific conf to sql-client less disturbing. We can always break it out to another file later when extra configuration files are needed for sql-client in the future. \r\n\r\nWhat do you guys

@twalthr ,\r\n\r\nIMO, it's better to seperate the configuration of SQL client from the configuration of the Flink job. From the user's perspective, many of them probably do not need to know or use SQL client, putting a SQL client section in flink-conf.yaml will just confuse the users because they might think that's part of their flink job configuration. \r\n\r\nI suggest, as you already mentioned, we can either 1) add some variable in the sql-client.sh to allow the advanced users to modify the JVM ARGS within the script or 2) add a sql-client-conf.yaml to allow advanced user to edit it.\r\n\r\nAssuming that it is uncommon to modify the JVM options of the sql client, I think both options are fine, but I slightly prefer option 2 since sql-client.sh is not supposed to modified by the users.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/382632059/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/382636403","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/5875#issuecomment-382636403","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/5875","id":382636403,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MjYzNjQwMw==","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-19T07:21:07Z","updated_at":"2018-04-19T07:21:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Silven1117 My apologies, i went right at it since it was such an quick fix.

I'll have a look and comment there.\r\n\r\nRegarding the question of whether to directly embed `MapState` in the generated code and remove the `DistinctAccumulator` or not, I think we should keep it as it is for now.\r\n\r\nWe would have to add a field to the `Row` that stores the accumulators to be able to store the `HashMap` which are used in the non-statebacked case. Also, would need to change the return type of functions that return partial aggregates to include the distinct maps. In the current approach, we have everything nicely encapsulated in each accumulator. We can optimize the solution later in a separate issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/383078333/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/383105607","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/5880#issuecomment-383105607","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/5880","id":383105607,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MzEwNTYwNw==","user":{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-20T14:01:29Z","updated_at":"2018-04-20T14:01:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yes, +1 after that is fixed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/383105607/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/383106035","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/5880#issuecomment-383106035","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/5880","id":383106035,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MzEwNjAzNQ==","user":{"login":"StefanRRichter","id":2128543,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjg1NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2128543?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter","html_url":"https://github.com/StefanRRichter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-20T14:02:56Z","updated_at":"2018-04-20T14:02:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the comments, will fix the names and then merge.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/383106035/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
