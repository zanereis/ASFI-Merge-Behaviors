Visual Studio 2015 provides better support for C++11/14, but it cannot work with any version of CUDA. \n  Fortunately, Microsoft has provided a patch, allowing VS2013 to support more C++11/14 features. The official page is [here](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=41151). \n  Someone has reported that the patch cannot be installed successfully on their computer. I have archived and uploaded the files installed on my computer. You can download it from [OneDrive](http://1drv.ms/1RApcXr) or [BaiduYun](http://pan.baidu.com/s/1dVnJo).\n- There are three third-party libraries should be installed, [OpenCV](http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-win/3.0.0/opencv-3.0.0.exe/download), [CuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn) and [OpenBlas](http://sourceforge.net/projects/openblas/files/v0.2.14/). You can download and install them from their official sites, or directly download all of them from [OneDrive](http://1drv.ms/1hzq9Cq) or [BaiduYun](http://pan.baidu.com/s/1kTrQmn9).\n  It is suggested to create a `3rdparty` or `thirdparty` folder in the root of mxnet, and put the thirdparty libraries in each subfoldes, such as `./3rdparty/OpenBLAS`. \n- If your GPU's compute capability is less or equal to 2.1, you should remove `USE_CUDNN` when configuring CMake. You can look up for your GPU's compute capability in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA .\n- Be careful that CMake will not give any warning or error if you haven't set the path of CUDNN. **Remember to set them.**\n- When you are using Debug mode, please modify the variable `vs_configuration` defined in `./python/mxnet/libinfo.py` from `Release` to `Debug`.\n- [PTVS](https://github.com/Microsoft/PTVS/releases) is a very powerful tool for editting and debugging python codes in Visual Studio. I strongly recommend you to install it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/147304564/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/147332212","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/256#issuecomment-147332212","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/256","id":147332212,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NzMzMjIxMg==","user":{"login":"junranhe","id":12316898,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzE2ODk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12316898?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junranhe","html_url":"https://github.com/junranhe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junranhe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junranhe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junranhe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junranhe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junranhe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junranhe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junranhe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junranhe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junranhe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-12T08:52:39Z","updated_at":"2015-10-12T08:52:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"kvstore_device 改为init的时候记录下所有values的shape，第一次update的时候初始化所有mergebuf，ps：代码里是不是还有其他地方会影响每个设备分配内存的大小的？发现每次起来极其，还是显存分布还是有些浮动\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/147332212/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/147402537","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/261#issuecomment-147402537","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/261","id":147402537,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NzQwMjUzNw==","user":{"login":"pluskid","id":3542,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3542?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid","html_url":"https://github.com/pluskid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-12T13:38:07Z","updated_at":"2015-10-12T13:38:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@happynear I apologize if my comments offend you.

A block is a batch of image we load in(usually larger than batch size) as a unit in the data loader, and the shuffling going on for every block. Including the first epoch. So that logic https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/master/src/io/iter_image_recordio.cc#L350 is doing shuffling after one block is loaded in, and the iterator returns the images in the shuffled order.\n\nIt is harder to do a global shuffle, mainly due to cost random seek. So in general, what we can do is divide the data into blocks, load the blocks in random order, and shuffle the data within the block.\n\nCurrent ImageRecordIter implemented within block shuffling, but did not yet implement random load of blocks\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/147933883/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/147934290","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/279#issuecomment-147934290","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/279","id":147934290,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NzkzNDI5MA==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-14T04:49:45Z","updated_at":"2015-10-14T04:49:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Currently the checkpoint only contains the symbol and the ndarrays.
