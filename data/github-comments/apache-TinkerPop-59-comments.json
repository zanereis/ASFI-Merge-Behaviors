Add an abstract method to `Traversal.java` called `notifyClosed()`\r\n2. That method should be called inside `close()` method of `Traversal.java`\r\n3. `DefaultTraversal.java` should have a member called `isClosed` which would be set to `true` inside it's implementation of `notifyClosed()`. `DefaultTraversal` would also have a method called `isClosed()` which will return the value of `isClosed` member.\r\n4. In the `hasNext()` method of `DefaultTraversal`, it will check if `isClosed()` is true and if yes, then it will return false. Note that this is not breaking in the sense that today the behaviour of iterator hasNext() after being closed in undefined. We are correcting the semantics here such that you cannot access the iterator when it is closed already. Same change for `next()`, it should return NoSuchElement exception when called on closed iterator.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/997810991/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/997899015","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1516#issuecomment-997899015","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1516","id":997899015,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc47ersH","user":{"login":"divijvaidya","id":71267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya","html_url":"https://github.com/divijvaidya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-20T12:55:07Z","updated_at":"2021-12-20T12:55:07Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Vote +1\r\n\r\nMinor comment to add an example in the changelog so that users can see what new syntax is available.

with it, i.e. it expects a fully-qualified string.\r\n\r\nQ1: Is it a typo within the spec? Usually it explicitly mentions when a fully-qualified form is required, and non-FQ is expected otherwise.\r\nQ2: If A1 is true then, I guess, the same is applied to other Enum based types like Cardinality, Order, and so on, right?\r\nQ3: By the way, when gremlin-server errors in case of a non-fully-qualified string then a client gets no response and waits until its own timeout. Maybe a client should get something like 'wrong request' response instead of keeping silence from the server side? But this is a side question, not related to GraphBinary implementation for gremlin-javascript. Does it need a JIRA ticket creation for future consideration?\r\n\r\nCould you please guide me from gremlin-core Java side perspective? I will help with a PR to fix the spec, if it gets confirmed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1028467119/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1028780542","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1547#issuecomment-1028780542","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1547","id":1028780542,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc49UfH-","user":{"login":"jorgebay","id":2931196,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MzExOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2931196?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay","html_url":"https://github.com/jorgebay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-03T09:29:39Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T09:29:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"hm...

Thus, the experimental version aka minimum viable version (MVP) that gets merged into the repository has to adhere to certain code quality which would help us in code maintenance.
