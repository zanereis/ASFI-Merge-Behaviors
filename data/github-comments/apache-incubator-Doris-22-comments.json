And I have some questions:\r\n1. One solution is get real disk space avaliable group by storage medium, and check is there are avaliable space for specify storage medium  when create or alter table/partition, But the solution has a problem that it may cannot constrain the existing partition, so should we separate the doris disk manage into two aspect, such as separate FE's High Watermark into two aspect like hdd_storage_high_watermark_usage_percent && ssd_storage_high_watermark_usage_percent?\r\n2. Should we refacor the checkDataSizeQuota logic  to limit the quota by real usage?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/621145565/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/621170578","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/issues/3432#issuecomment-621170578","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/3432","id":621170578,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyMTE3MDU3OA==","user":{"login":"imay","id":1249159,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDkxNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1249159?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay","html_url":"https://github.com/imay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-29T12:28:00Z","updated_at":"2020-04-29T12:28:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This bug may lead to data loss?\r\n@morningman @WingsGo should investigate this issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/621170578/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/621172837","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/issues/3433#issuecomment-621172837","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/3433","id":621172837,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyMTE3MjgzNw==","user":{"login":"imay","id":1249159,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDkxNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1249159?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay","html_url":"https://github.com/imay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-29T12:32:21Z","updated_at":"2020-04-29T12:32:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"1. can refer this issue in related PR and issue.\r\n2.
