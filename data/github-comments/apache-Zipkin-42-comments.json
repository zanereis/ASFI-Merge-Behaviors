The trace and span id would help ensure against collision. It is unlikely a span will be reported twice in the same millisecond.\n\nSo, if I wrote the same span successively (for client and server), it would look like the following rows:\n\"1475335327601-0000000000000001.0000000000000003\"\n\"1475335439449-0000000000000001.0000000000000003\"\n\nThis would be a longer id than the normal ones in ES, and not good for any automated analysis, could be helpful to answer your question about when the span was stored without defining another field.

I used a crude '/zipkin-<date>/_stats' end point to see when the index was last written to but having a timestamp field on the ingested span would make this process a lot easier.\n\nI think the best way approach here is to add an @timestamp field to every span that is ingested. The value of the @timestamp field would be the time the span is written to ES. This is a standard practice for other logs ingested by logstash, so it is not odd thing to do in ES land. Since this change is localized to the ES module, it shouldn't impact other storage engines or the interface.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/251275616/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/251275814","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1046#issuecomment-251275814","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1046","id":251275814,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MTI3NTgxNA==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-04T01:52:14Z","updated_at":"2016-10-04T01:52:14Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/1326\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/251275814/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/251275968","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/1326#issuecomment-251275968","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1326","id":251275968,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MTI3NTk2OA==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-04T01:53:32Z","updated_at":"2016-10-04T01:53:32Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"tested

I've seen some references suggesting even that it is internal. It seems they have changed formatting before. I don't like the idea of misleading people into thinking this is logstash interop and then that accidentally breaking.\n\nMy thought is that if we are to do this, be specific in a way where we can inform people what to do with this. Ex. `collector_timestamp` (because we don't have a component named ingestor), and make it epoch millis as that's the least overhead and burden for those who will never read this.\n\nWDYT?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/251296965/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/251299887","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1318#issuecomment-251299887","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1318","id":251299887,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MTI5OTg4Nw==","user":{"login":"mansu","id":93836,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzODM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/93836?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mansu","html_url":"https://github.com/mansu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mansu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mansu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mansu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mansu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mansu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mansu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mansu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mansu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mansu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-04T05:32:27Z","updated_at":"2016-10-04T05:32:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@adriancole I looked at the code earlier and had the same feeling.

Regardless, it is probably best started as a separate repo I think.\n\nThis is a good idea. Historically, we've already abandoned one DB backend (HBase, the support for that was eventually discontinued), and having implementations in separate repositories means it's up to module maintainers to make sure the backends are up to date. If support for ObscureDB/FadDB is implemented, and then the original authors lose interest and/or nobody else wants to maintain it, then the burden will not be in the core team, it will be on the developers who want to run Zipkin on XxxDB. (I'm not saying PostgreSQL is obscure, it's widely used in the tech world)\n\nThere is a balance to strike, between supporting modules in the core repo or separate repos. MySQL was chosen as the relational/simple-to-setup SQL alternative, and Cassandra for the high-scale deployment solution.

Here's what that ended up as.\n- once we start worrying about retention policy for \"saved tweets\" we approach the complexity of the span store (again)\n- this is compounded by a need for an api change, which would break folks to support a feature that hasn't been requested widely\n- the more complexity we add our component apis, the harder future changes get\n\nI've an alternative proposal: do it all on the client\n\nInstead of creating a secondary tier storage in our api, simply deploy twice. Ex use a keyspace/DB for the transient trace depot and another for the \"permanent\" one.\n\nEx. index=zipkin (for transient) and index=zipkin-4ever for permanent.\n\nThe second is fronted by vanilla zipkin-servers that don't run any collectors except http. The act of \"saving a trace\" is just taking the json from the transient one and POSTing it to the permanent one.\n\nSomeone could later change the zipkin-ui (or as some sort of plugin) to query across both and/or create a automatic flow (such as a button which clicked posts to the \"permanent\" zipkin). cc @rogeralsing @eirslett \n\nThis automatically solves any future needs around retention, as the same mechanics can be used. The only difference is that in the case of cassandra, the keyspace should be affected prior to use, notably to remove the TTL (or set it to a very long value). The best win is that there's no code impact on server components. They remain simple and probably more \"microservice\" as a result.\n\nthoughts?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/252545267/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/252588271","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1093#issuecomment-252588271","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1093","id":252588271,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MjU4ODI3MQ==","user":{"login":"basvanbeek","id":7205296,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyMDUyOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7205296?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/basvanbeek","html_url":"https://github.com/basvanbeek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/basvanbeek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/basvanbeek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/basvanbeek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/basvanbeek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/basvanbeek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/basvanbeek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/basvanbeek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/basvanbeek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/basvanbeek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-10T11:04:12Z","updated_at":"2016-10-10T11:04:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Sounds good to me if we take the plugin approach for zipkin-ui, that way people have the biggest flexibility to tie this together with their usage concerns and make their own infrastructure choices with the greatest ease of use. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/252588271/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/252675043","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1093#issuecomment-252675043","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1093","id":252675043,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MjY3NTA0Mw==","user":{"login":"mansu","id":93836,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzODM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/93836?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mansu","html_url":"https://github.com/mansu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mansu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mansu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mansu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mansu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mansu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mansu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mansu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mansu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mansu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-10T16:42:32Z","updated_at":"2016-10-10T16:42:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@adriancole making favoriting/saving a tracing part of the client and then the client copy the traces between the 2 stores is my preferred approach for the following reasons:\n(a) the spans will remain immutable\n(b) In addition to the UI, other applications can also write to this end point to save traces for ever.\n(c) with an additional annotation on the root span we can create save or favorite feature.\n\nHowever, I prefer making this a feature of the current backend instead of having separate clusters though.
