Fields which should properly be `final`, just the `final` modifier was missed out. This is the wast majority of the 295 total occurrences in the project. The goal of this inspection check is to fix these omissions and prevent them in the future.\r\n 2. Fields which are effectively `final`, but cannot formally be `final` because the Java compiler complains. Example: `threadMXBean` and `initialized` from your comment. What we should do about these fields: suppress the annotation using `@SuppressWarnings(\"SSBasedInspection\") // effectively final field; suppressing for \"static, non final field\" pattern` with these fields.\r\n 3. Static, truly mutable fields. This is an anti-pattern and should be avoided.
