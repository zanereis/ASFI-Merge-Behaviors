I added L202-207 for now.  This PR arises when working with @garrensmith on one issue in his Mac environment. We got segment fault on Catalina with spidermonkey 1.8.5 (might be related to 32 bit compatibility issue)and work fine after switching to 60. Knowing that this doesn't happen in every development environment, but it is helpful to add spidermonkey 60 support in fdb-layer branch to continue. \r\n\r\nThanks for forking `3.x`, and thus we can have `prototype/fdb-layer` to hit `master` soon. In `master` branch, knowing that there is spidermonkey 60 support already. However, still need to merge codes from fdb-layer branch to master branch. If my understanding is correct, this looks like that two small branch rivers (fdb-layer branch and master branch) converge into one big river, and we need to make big river to work fine. The commits on these 2 branches need to be reviewed and some commit in master might need to be replaced/rewritten by commits in fdb-layer branch. I am quite open to have this PR to merge or not. For now, it can leave chance to have spidermonkey 60 support to work with fdb-layer ealier.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/583978544/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/584017826","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/2430#issuecomment-584017826","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/2430","id":584017826,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NDAxNzgyNg==","user":{"login":"fne","id":6025622,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMjU2MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6025622?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fne","html_url":"https://github.com/fne","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fne/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fne/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fne/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fne/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fne/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fne/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fne/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fne/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fne/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-10T08:53:50Z","updated_at":"2020-02-10T08:53:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I also have this error and couchdb restart every day : \r\n`stderr,\"[notice] 2020-02-10T05:38:21.730591Z couchdb@couchdb-prod-couchdb-0.couchdb-prod-couchdb.prod.svc.cluster.local u003c0.356.0u003e -------- couch_replicator_clustering : cluster unstable \",\"2020-02-10T05:38:21.819Z\",\"aks-nodepool1-33780697-2\",,,54f99bab651526d6b30c03971db90dc9f445713a34320a6592213271cc655077\r\nstderr,\"[notice] 2020-02-10T05:38:21.803308Z couchdb@couchdb-prod-couchdb-0.couchdb-prod-couchdb.prod.svc.cluster.local u003c0.277.0u003e -------- rexi_buffer : cluster unstable \",\"2020-02-10T05:38:21.819Z\",\"aks-nodepool1-33780697-2\",,,54f99bab651526d6b30c03971db90dc9f445713a34320a6592213271cc655077\r\nstderr,\"[notice] 2020-02-10T05:38:21.814623Z couchdb@couchdb-prod-couchdb-0.couchdb-prod-couchdb.prod.svc.cluster.local u003c0.274.0u003e -------- rexi_server_mon : cluster unstable \",\"2020-02-10T05:38:21.819Z\",\"aks-nodepool1-33780697-2\",,,54f99bab651526d6b30c03971db90dc9f445713a34320a6592213271cc655077\r\nstderr,\"[notice] 2020-02-10T05:38:21.803005Z couchdb@couchdb-prod-couchdb-0.couchdb-prod-couchdb.prod.svc.cluster.local u003c0.278.0u003e -------- rexi_server_mon : cluster unstable \",\"2020-02-10T05:38:21.819Z\",\"aks-nodepool1-33780697-2\",,,54f99bab651526d6b30c03971db90dc9f445713a34320a6592213271cc655077\r\nstderr,\"[notice] 2020-02-10T05:38:21.815623Z couchdb@couchdb-prod-couchdb-0.couchdb-prod-couchdb.prod.svc.cluster.local u003c0.273.0u003e -------- rexi_server : cluster unstable \",\"2020-02-10T05:38:21.819Z\",\"aks-nodepool1-33780697-2\",,,54f99bab651526d6b30c03971db90dc9f445713a34320a6592213271cc655077\r\nstderr,\"[notice] 2020-02-10T05:38:21.811468Z couchdb@couchdb-prod-couchdb-0.couchdb-prod-couchdb.prod.svc.cluster.local u003c0.428.0u003e -------- Stopping replicator db changes listener u003c0.7246.0u003e \",\"2020-02-10T05:38:21.819Z\",\"aks-nodepool1-33780697-2\",,,54f99bab651526d6b30c03971db90dc9f445713a34320a6592213271cc655077\r\n`\r\n\r\nIs it a bad config ??

@valpa sorry for delayed response.\r\n\r\nIn CouchDB the revs are generated based on parent revisions. That helps for example when the same document is created and edited in the same way on two different servers and then those dbs get replicated together, because revisions are deterministic based on content and parent revision, no conflicts should be generated. If revisions are completely random the would be conflicts.\r\n\r\nHere is the place where it happens: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/couchdb/blob/master/src/couch/src/couch_db.erl#L1125-L1140\r\n\r\nHaving a random uuid generated there would result in a proliferation of document conflicts.\r\n\r\nIt might also be easier to just add a timestamp to your document and simply inspect that timestamp value later.\r\n\r\nHave, having said that, now you also know of a good place to experiment :-). So give it a try and see what would happen if you replace it a uuid1 generated value there.\r\n\r\nBut I think I'll close the issue, as I don't think there is much of a chance to change the CouchDB behavior there. If you think it deserves a proper discussion for others to chime in, start a mailing list discussion.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/584209608/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/584399909","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/2528#issuecomment-584399909","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/2528","id":584399909,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NDM5OTkwOQ==","user":{"login":"wohali","id":112292,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjI5Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112292?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali","html_url":"https://github.com/wohali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-10T22:59:18Z","updated_at":"2020-02-10T22:59:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This is pretty common on FreeBSD now:\r\n\r\nhttps://jenkins-cm1.apache.org/blue/organizations/jenkins/jenkins-cm1%2FFullPlatformMatrix/detail/3.0.x/5/pipeline\r\n\r\nhttps://jenkins-cm1.apache.org/blue/organizations/jenkins/jenkins-cm1%2FFullPlatformMatrix/detail/3.0.x/4/pipeline","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/584399909/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/584726695","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/2539#issuecomment-584726695","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/2539","id":584726695,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NDcyNjY5NQ==","user":{"login":"eiri","id":70542,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNTQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70542?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiri","html_url":"https://github.com/eiri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiri/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-11T16:37:38Z","updated_at":"2020-02-11T16:37:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@davisp : Hi Paul, I'm almost done with this, the only thing I'm still wrestling is a limiter on a depth of flattening JSON.

The transition at that threshold seems like it'd be an easy off-by-one territory.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/585340067/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/585482688","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/1524#issuecomment-585482688","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1524","id":585482688,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NTQ4MjY4OA==","user":{"login":"wohali","id":112292,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjI5Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112292?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali","html_url":"https://github.com/wohali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-13T00:11:07Z","updated_at":"2020-02-13T00:11:07Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@natcohen This is slated for the CouchDB 3.x release stream, but was moved out of the 3.0 release due to scheduling conflicts.

is now fixed in the new Windows CouchDB 3.0 installer (to be uploaded with the 3.0 release), as part of changes necessary to support prompting for the admin user/password on install.\r\n\r\nThe new installer now takes these actions, in order:\r\n* prompts for the mandatory admin user & password\r\n* Installs the user-editable config files as `vm.args.dist` and `local.ini.dist`\r\n* Creates the file `etc\\local.d\\10-admins.ini` with the admin user specified in the installer, but **only if** the file does not yet exist\r\n* Copies the `vm.args.dist` file to `vm.args`, but **only if** that file doesn't exist yet\r\n* Copies the `local.ini.dist` file to `local.ini`, but **only if** that file doesn't exist yet\r\n* Starts the CouchDB service, which encrypts the plaintext password in `etc\\local.d\\10-admins.ini` immediately\r\n\r\nOn uninstall, the new uninstaller:\r\n* correctly stops both the Apache CouchDB service and the `epmd.exe` process\r\n* only removes the `vm.args` file, but **only if** it exactly matches the `vm.args.dist` file\r\n* only removes the `local.ini` file, but **only if** it exactly matches the `local.ini.dist` file\r\n* removes the `vm.args.dist` and `local.ini.dist` files along with the rest of the install\r\n* leaves behind the `etc\\local.d\\10-admins.ini` file, along with the contents of `data\\`\r\n\r\nThe new behaviour above is supported through a WiX custom action written in C#.\r\n\r\nUpgrades for now are still uninstall-then-reinstall, but the above safeguards mean that both your data and the user configurations are untouched during the process.\r\n\r\n@popojargo Keep in mind that when you uninstall CouchDB 2.3.1, it'll still remove the user config files, but after you install 3.0.0, it won't happen again.\r\n\r\nOne final note, since people may want to know: if you want to do a silent install of CouchDB,  here's how:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmsiexec /i apache-couchdb-3.0.0.msi /quiet ADMINUSER=admin ADMINPASSWORD=hunter2 /norestart\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe uninstall is similar:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmsiexec /x apache-couchdb-3.0.0.msi /quiet /norestart\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/585507440/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/585693261","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/2188#issuecomment-585693261","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/2188","id":585693261,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NTY5MzI2MQ==","user":{"login":"florianb","id":983507,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MzUwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/983507?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianb","html_url":"https://github.com/florianb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-13T11:32:30Z","updated_at":"2020-02-13T11:32:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I'm pretty new to Erlang but this is what i found out on my search for implemented escape-mechanisms.\r\n\r\nI think this issue is caused by a malicious call or implementation of `config_utils:implode`

It seems some nodes in the cluster, get disconnected from other nodes. I was specifically looking at `rexi_DOWN` messages, write with quorum errors.\r\n`rexi` in this case is an internal component which performs inter-node RPC.\r\n\r\nThese disconnects can also be seen in the original logs as `rexi_buffer : cluster unstable` lines. . Those are expected during the initial cluster startup and shutdown. \r\n\r\nMonitor to see when those errors start going up and how it relates to RAM usage. In other words see if increase in connection errors coincide with increased RAM usage.\r\n\r\nAlso there was bug in 2.3.1 release where sometimes requests like _changes feed workers were not cleaned up sometimes after the client connection ends. Is your RAM usage increase correlated with specific types of requests?\r\n\r\nAnother experiment could be, for debugging purposes, to start single node cluster and see if it experiences the same issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/586653684/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/586743462","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/2554#issuecomment-586743462","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/2554","id":586743462,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4Njc0MzQ2Mg==","user":{"login":"ahaus","id":1169145,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjkxNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1169145?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahaus","html_url":"https://github.com/ahaus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahaus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahaus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahaus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahaus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahaus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahaus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahaus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahaus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahaus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-16T19:30:36Z","updated_at":"2020-02-16T19:30:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[log.txt](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/files/4210718/log.txt)\r\nAttached log.txt","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/586743462/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/586779919","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/2554#issuecomment-586779919","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/2554","id":586779919,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4Njc3OTkxOQ==","user":{"login":"wohali","id":112292,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjI5Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112292?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali","html_url":"https://github.com/wohali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-17T01:12:02Z","updated_at":"2020-02-17T01:12:02Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I won't be able to look at this until Tuesday earliest.
