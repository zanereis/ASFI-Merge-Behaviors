Small update on what we discussed about in the call:\r\n\r\n- Do not touch the unomi IncrementInterestAction. This action have his own logic and cannot be generify with property incrementation, also the interest incrementation from JExperience is not using this action, it's actually using a script and the setPropertyAction.\r\n- Create a new Action: IncrementPropertyAction: \r\n  - propertyName: to be able to increment or create a single prop (properties.pageViewCount)\r\n  - rootPropertyName: to be able to increment all props under this one: (ex: profile.properties.interest)\r\n  - incrementWithValues: to be able to increment properties with the values coming from the event. (ex: event.properties.interest)\r\n  - storeInSession: to be able to target the profile or the session.\r\n\r\n### Real exemple coming from JEXperience:\r\n**the increment page count:** \r\n```\r\n\"actions\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"parameterValues\": {\r\n        \"setPropertyName\": \"properties.pageViewCount\",\r\n        \"setPropertyValue\": \"script::r = profile.properties['pageViewCount']; if (r == null) { profile.properties['pageViewCount'] = []; profile.properties.pageViewCount = [event.scope : 1] } else { if (r[event.scope] != null) { r[event.scope] = r[event.scope] + 1 } else { r[event.scope] = 1 }} r\",\r\n        \"storeInSession\": false\r\n      },\r\n      \"type\": \"setPropertyAction\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe should be able to do it with this kind of conf:\r\n**type: incrementPropertyAction**\r\n**paramerterValues:**\r\n- **propertyName: properties.pageViewCount**\r\n- **storeInSession: false**\r\n\r\n**The increment interest from jexperience:**\r\n```\r\n\"actions\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"parameterValues\": {\r\n        \"setPropertyName\": \"properties.interests\",\r\n        \"setPropertyValue\": \"script::r = profile.properties['interests']; foreach(interest : event.target.properties['interests'].entrySet()) { if (r == null) { r = [interest.key: interest.value] } else if (r[interest.key] != null) { r[interest.key] = r[interest.key] + interest.value } else { r[interest.key] = interest.value } } r\",\r\n        \"storeInSession\": false\r\n      },\r\n      \"type\": \"setPropertyAction\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe should be able to replace it, with:\r\n**type:incrementPropertyAction**\r\n**paramerterValues:**\r\n- **rootPropertyName: properties.interest**\r\n- **incrementWithEventValues: target.properties.interest**\r\n- **storeInSession: false**\r\n\r\nThis way we will be able to replace the script usage we have in the rules in JExperience to use a generic increment action.\r\nThe Existing IncrementInterestAction is missleading, and confusing because there is also interest incrementation in jexperience. But the both are completely differents.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/unomi/issues/comments/804209534/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/unomi/issues/comments/808125869","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/unomi/pull/269#issuecomment-808125869","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/unomi/issues/269","id":808125869,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwODEyNTg2OQ==","user":{"login":"jkevan","id":745718,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NTcxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/745718?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkevan","html_url":"https://github.com/jkevan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkevan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkevan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkevan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkevan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkevan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkevan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkevan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkevan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkevan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-26T11:06:42Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T11:06:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Thanks Kevan for fixing this.
