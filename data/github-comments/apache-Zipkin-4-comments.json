The motivation behind only fetching one column first for each subquery is to address sparse return sets. \nFor example, imagine you're joining two subqueries that fetch slices (`S1` and `S2`) from their respective indices. These slices are ordered by timestamp, so let's let the last entry in each slice have timestamp `T1` and `T2`. Since spans from the same trace _probably_ have a small difference in timestamps, we should set the `endTimestamp` to be `min(T1, T2)`. This will fix the problem where you have a very sparse index joined with a giant one so you only zero in on the time slice where the small index has entries.\nYou can see that do the actual query a bit father down in that method.\n\nAre you seeing bad/unexpected behavior in Redis?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/9359944/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/9362235","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/176#issuecomment-9362235","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/176","id":9362235,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDkzNjIyMzU=","user":{"login":"mosesn","id":156562,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjU2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/156562?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosesn","html_url":"https://github.com/mosesn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosesn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosesn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosesn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosesn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosesn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosesn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosesn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosesn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosesn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-10-11T23:43:44Z","updated_at":"2012-10-11T23:44:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I am only getting one trace back.  I think what is happening is that, because I am only asking about one span, it goes to the \"case head :: nil\" case and then executes the query by itself.

It seems like this might not be the correct solution to the problem, because I didn't understand what was going on, but I think this is definitely a problem.
