The `DiskStoreImpl.offlineCompact()` method (used by `compact offline-disk-store` command), as an example, already does that:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  public static DiskStoreImpl offlineCompact(String name, File[] dirs, boolean upgradeVersionOnly,\r\n      long maxOplogSize) throws Exception {\r\n    try {\r\n      DiskStoreImpl dsi =\r\n          createForOffline(name, dirs, true, false, upgradeVersionOnly, maxOplogSize, true, false);\r\n      dsi.offlineCompact();\r\n      dsi.close();\r\n      return dsi;\r\n    } finally {\r\n      cleanupOffline();\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs a side note, I believe some more tests should be added to the `PR` in order to get approval.\r\nThe ticket specifies that some threads (the `flusherThread` specifically) are not properly closed after invoking offline `disk-store` commands, but no tests were added to exhibit the bug itself, so nothing can be used to prove the problem is fixed after applying the changes.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/638793177/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/639031361","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/5176#issuecomment-639031361","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/5176","id":639031361,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzOTAzMTM2MQ==","user":{"login":"metatype","id":2790361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3OTAzNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2790361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype","html_url":"https://github.com/metatype","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-04T18:28:41Z","updated_at":"2020-06-04T18:28:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Passing this over to Bill and Bruce, I'm afraid I don't have much context.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/639031361/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/639188005","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/5184#issuecomment-639188005","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/5184","id":639188005,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzOTE4ODAwNQ==","user":{"login":"lgtm-com[bot]","id":43144390,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDMxNDQzOTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/17324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/lgtm-com","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-05T00:24:45Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T00:24:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This pull request **fixes 1 alert** when merging 7cb9765300b7751d4059f33d728c252fd3ddfaba into 41f3d4e6b1c8a10eb22940683ccd100ac654432b -

We tried to choose the 2x and 3x values so that there is a sufficient buffer between (a) the minimum wait time, (b) the time at which the coordinator membership becomes \"reachable\", and (c) the locator wait time. We saw that with these values the test did pass and fail reliably. We also tried writing a test using `GMSJoinLeaveJUnitTest` but it had the same type of timing dependencies.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty here is that we're trying to write \"black box\" style tests for a timeout. I don't see a way to avoid the timing dependencies without a large refactor, which I was trying to avoid since this is otherwise a small change with very little risk.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/644401196/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/644908304","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/5231#issuecomment-644908304","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/5231","id":644908304,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0NDkwODMwNA==","user":{"login":"alb3rtobr","id":5363407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjM0MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5363407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr","html_url":"https://github.com/alb3rtobr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-16T17:36:19Z","updated_at":"2020-06-16T17:36:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> One change, please: change \"needs to exist\" to \"must exist\".

It probably should be addressed, though.\r\n```\r\n16-Jun-2020 16:54:11.924 SEVERE [http-nio-8080-exec-3] org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11Processor.service Error processing request\r\n\tjava.lang.NullPointerException\r\n\t\tat org.apache.geode.modules.session.catalina.AbstractCommitSessionValve.commitSession(AbstractCommitSessionValve.java:63)\r\n\t\tat org.apache.geode.modules.session.catalina.Tomcat9CommitSessionValve.lambda$wrapResponse$0(Tomcat9CommitSessionValve.java:44)\r\n\t\tat org.apache.geode.modules.session.catalina.Tomcat9CommitSessionOutputBuffer.doWrite(Tomcat9CommitSessionOutputBuffer.java:40)\r\n\t\tat org.apache.coyote.Response.doWrite(Response.java:601)\r\n\t\tat org.apache.catalina.connector.OutputBuffer.realWriteBytes(OutputBuffer.java:339)\r\n\t\tat org.apache.catalina.connector.OutputBuffer.flushByteBuffer(OutputBuffer.java:776)\r\n\t\tat org.apache.catalina.connector.OutputBuffer.doFlush(OutputBuffer.java:298)\r\n\t\tat org.apache.catalina.connector.OutputBuffer.close(OutputBuffer.java:251)\r\n\t\tat org.apache.catalina.connector.Response.finishResponse(Response.java:441)\r\n\t\tat org.apache.catalina.connector.CoyoteAdapter.service(CoyoteAdapter.java:374)\r\n\t\tat org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11Processor.service(Http11Processor.java:373)\r\n\t\tat org.apache.coyote.AbstractProcessorLight.process(AbstractProcessorLight.java:65)\r\n\t\tat org.apache.coyote.AbstractProtocol$ConnectionHandler.process(AbstractProtocol.java:868)\r\n\t\tat org.apache.tomcat.util.net.NioEndpoint$SocketProcessor.doRun(NioEndpoint.java:1594)\r\n\t\tat org.apache.tomcat.util.net.SocketProcessorBase.run(SocketProcessorBase.java:49)\r\n\t\tat java.base/java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1128)\r\n\t\tat java.base/java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:628)\r\n\t\tat org.apache.tomcat.util.threads.TaskThread$WrappingRunnable.run(TaskThread.java:61)\r\n\t\tat java.base/java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:834)\r\n```\r\nThe context is null in this case, so the NPE is thrown attempting to get the Manager:\r\n```\r\n                                         final Context context = request.getContext();\r\nAbstractCommitSessionValve.java:63 ->    final Manager manager = context.getManager();\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/645070010/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/645408502","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/5257#issuecomment-645408502","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/5257","id":645408502,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0NTQwODUwMg==","user":{"login":"jinmeiliao","id":15638418,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjM4NDE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15638418?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao","html_url":"https://github.com/jinmeiliao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-17T14:27:31Z","updated_at":"2020-06-17T14:27:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> What's the point for these changes?\r\n> I have ran the test case without them and it passes.\r\n> Also, I have searched in the Geode code for the use of this file and have only found it in `ObjectInputStreamFilterWrapper.java`.
