So it's obviously incorrect. Basically, a `!=` operator should have commutative law, which is: `lhs != rhs <=> rhs != lhs`. \r\n\r\nThe old one:\r\n```C++\r\n  bool operator!=(const TEnumIterator& end) {\r\n    THRIFT_UNUSED_VARIABLE(end);\r\n    assert(end.n_ == -1);  // assume this is the end iterator\r\n    return (ii_ != n_);  // only check the left hand side because we assumed the right hand side is end iterator\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm writing a new operator which can handle general cases, which can also satisfy the commutative law. \r\n\r\nThe new logic is that:\r\n```C++\r\n  bool operator==(const TEnumIterator& rhs) const {\r\n    bool is_end = ii_ == n_ || n_ == -1;  // check if left hand side is an end iterator. \r\n    bool is_rhs_end = rhs.ii_ == rhs.n_ || rhs.n_ == -1;  // check if right hand side is an end iterator. \r\n    return (ii_ == rhs.ii_ && n_ == rhs.n_) || (is_end && is_rhs_end);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nNote that https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/984b59a2b4edb03479947c46007fc6142447f759/cpp/src/generated/parquet_types.cpp#L36 uses `n_ = -1` to represent the end iterator, so we need to regard either `ii_ == n_` or `n_ == -1` as an end iterator. They should be the same. \r\nObviously, if `ii_` and `n_` are the same, they should be the same iterators. Otherwise, if they are both end iterator, they should be regarded as the same iterators. \r\n\r\n> Why is the `!=` operator not just calling the `==` operator and returning the negated result?\r\n\r\nI pushed a new commit. Now the `!=` operator is just calling the `==` operator.
