I'm running Debian testing, and had a very similar problem. I got a similar error when running `pip install caravel`. After the error, I did run, as you suggest\n\n```\npip install cryptography\n```\n\nAnd I see how cryptography-1.1.4 is installed. But the weird thing is that if I run after that\n\n```\npip install caravel\n```\n\nI see that cryptography-1.1.1 is installed once again:\n\n```\n(caravel)jgb@expisito:~/venvs$ pip install caravel\nRequirement already satisfied (use --upgrade to upgrade): caravel in ./caravel/lib/python2.7/site-packages\nRequirement already satisfied (use --upgrade to upgrade): babel==2.3.4 in

Looking here (http://nvd3.org/examples/scatter.html) it looks like a deliberate styling choice by nvd3....just jars with me for some reason. \n\n<img width=\"1144\" alt=\"687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f78637931516a4e2e706e67\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4076720/16289800/a110e2f0-393b-11e6-9498-1c3f854af942.png\">\n. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/227931888/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/227938162","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/661#issuecomment-227938162","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/661","id":227938162,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNzkzODE2Mg==","user":{"login":"chejinye","id":20102032,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTAyMDMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20102032?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chejinye","html_url":"https://github.com/chejinye","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chejinye/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chejinye/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chejinye/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chejinye/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chejinye/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chejinye/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chejinye/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chejinye/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chejinye/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-23T03:07:01Z","updated_at":"2016-06-23T03:07:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Where the SQL statement is generated\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/227938162/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/227948641","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/662#issuecomment-227948641","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/662","id":227948641,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNzk0ODY0MQ==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-23T04:44:49Z","updated_at":"2016-06-23T04:44:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I'm not against changing these arbitrary labels, though I'm wondering if there's a way to escape them in the definition of the sqlalchemy dialect for Kylin.\n\nFor `count` it should be as easy as changing the metric name.

would add a bit to this. It's a little confusing that there are two query buttons - one top left and one top right. It would be simpler to only have one. Also, it may be worth not running the query on chart type change as too frequently the data is not set-up for the new chart type which leads to an error and you cannot fix that error without changing to another chart type. My suggestion would be to move query to the right of the chart type dropdown, make it a bold color and only show one query button. Also, only run query when the user clicks query not on chart type change as we don't re-run automatically when other inputs are changed. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/228026407/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/228026554","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/663#issuecomment-228026554","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/663","id":228026554,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyODAyNjU1NA==","user":{"login":"apitts","id":4076720,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNzY3MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4076720?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apitts","html_url":"https://github.com/apitts","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apitts/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apitts/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apitts/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apitts/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apitts/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apitts/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apitts/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apitts/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apitts/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-23T11:49:27Z","updated_at":"2016-06-23T11:49:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Have you tried wrapping the 0 in quotes? i.e. '0'. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/228026554/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/228048901","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/663#issuecomment-228048901","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/663","id":228048901,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyODA0ODkwMQ==","user":{"login":"kkalyan","id":391567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MTU2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/391567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkalyan","html_url":"https://github.com/kkalyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkalyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkalyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkalyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkalyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkalyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkalyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkalyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkalyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkalyan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-23T13:26:37Z","updated_at":"2016-06-23T13:26:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@apitts I did with '0' as well, but does not work. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/228048901/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/228103627","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/654#issuecomment-228103627","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/654","id":228103627,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyODEwMzYyNw==","user":{"login":"xrmx","id":12932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx","html_url":"https://github.com/xrmx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-23T16:20:35Z","updated_at":"2016-06-23T16:20:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"With my actual data pipeline the self join would be quite handy as i have denormalized data.
