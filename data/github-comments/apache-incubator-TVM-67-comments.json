In particular, we also specify the order of evaluation. Let me give an example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n%2 = %y + 1\r\n%1 = %x\r\nif (%1 == 0) {\r\n   %2\r\n} else {\r\n   %1 + %2\r\n}\r\n```\r\nShould be translated to:\r\n```\r\nlet %v1 = %x\r\nlet %v2 = %y + 1\r\nif (%v1 == 0) {\r\n  %v2\r\n} else {\r\n   %v1 + %v2\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe mapping from node to temp vars are : ```%1->%v1, %2->%v2```. Notice how the order of assignments is listed as v1 first then v2. This is because we need to have a way to uniquely define the order of the assignments if they are in the same scope level. \r\n\r\nOne way to define that is via post-DFS visit order. If we post DFS visit the graph, %1 get visited first (because of the condition). So our key is that we need deterministically maps a graph to ANF and give this mapping a clear semantics.\r\n\r\nI see you also commented on what might happen to lambda lifting, please give an example on that as well. These examples, along with a description of your algorithm, will help more reviewers to understand this pass, which is quite important. cc @jroesch \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/449655368/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/449661314","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2189#issuecomment-449661314","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2189","id":449661314,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0OTY2MTMxNA==","user":{"login":"slyubomirsky","id":5624871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MjQ4NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5624871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky","html_url":"https://github.com/slyubomirsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-23T20:24:13Z","updated_at":"2018-12-23T20:24:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Alright, I'll make a section in the PR description giving details about the algorithm and what problems it solves","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/449661314/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/449667476","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2189#issuecomment-449667476","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2189","id":449667476,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0OTY2NzQ3Ng==","user":{"login":"slyubomirsky","id":5624871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MjQ4NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5624871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky","html_url":"https://github.com/slyubomirsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-23T22:37:14Z","updated_at":"2018-12-23T22:37:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've added the description; I hope it is what you had in mind.

Thanks for your suggestion. I am not sure if I fully understand what you said. Let's me walk through a simple example.\r\n\r\n```\r\nx = relay.var(\"x\")\r\ny = relay.var(\"y\")\r\nz = relay.var(\"z\")\r\nadd = relay.add(x, y)\r\nsub = relay.sub(add, z)\r\n...\r\n```\r\nNow we what to assign `add` and `sub` to device `0` and `1`, respectively. Do you mean that users want to `on_device` like the following?\r\n```\r\nx = relay.var(\"x\")\r\ny = relay.var(\"y\")\r\nz = relay.var(\"z\")\r\nadd = relay.add(x, y)\r\non_device(add, 0)\r\nsub = relay.sub(add, z)\r\non_device(sub, 1)\r\n...\r\n```\r\nThen we run the annotation pass to rewrite the program to:\r\n```\r\nx = relay.var(\"x\")\r\ny = relay.var(\"y\")\r\nz = relay.var(\"z\")\r\nadd = relay.add(x, y)\r\ncopy0 = relay.device_copy(add)\r\nsub = relay.sub(copy0, z)\r\ncopy1 = relay.device_copy(sub)\r\n...\r\n```\r\nPlease correct me if there is any misunderstanding. Otherwise, I have a couple of questions:\r\n\r\n1. Are users supposed to go through the network and perform the annotation? It looks this might be handy when the network is large.\r\n2. How should we propagate the device ids? I think one way is to propagate the device id information based in a bottom-up manner where the device_copy op should have an `device_id` attribute.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/449780453/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/449786960","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2232#issuecomment-449786960","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2232","id":449786960,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0OTc4Njk2MA==","user":{"login":"joshpoll","id":21694516,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjk0NTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21694516?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll","html_url":"https://github.com/joshpoll","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-25T02:01:07Z","updated_at":"2018-12-25T02:01:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"global:

I wonder if it's worth going the code generation route with AST parsers and the works. IIUC this is akin to what TF does when generating things like the math operators. This shouldn't be too difficult for the C++ side using Clang (just onerous :).\r\n\r\nAll considered, though, it's great that the Relay op registry doesn't require adding patterns and schedules in Python.\r\n\r\nRelatedly, is there a way to ask Relay to schedule `broadcast`? `GLU` doesn't compile under Relay but does for NNVM when registered with \r\n```python\r\nreg.register_schedule(\"glu\", _fschedule_broadcast)  # <-- this is important, I think\r\nreg.register_pattern(\"glu\", OpPattern.INJECTIVE)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd finally, an outlandish proposal: clean up the codebase by removing all TOPI python ops. PyTOPI is useful for prototyping but is confusing when core ops are implemented in multiple places.

The problem that we quickly encounter, however, are:\r\n\r\n- It is hard to generate key-word argument bindings support with exactly the same signature.\r\n   - Doing so require quite a lot of additional meta information\r\n   - Usually, the best effort we can do still leaves things like ```myfunc(*args, **kwargs)```\r\n- It is hard to automatically expose clear doc-strings.\r\n- It usually confuses developer because they can not find the auto-generated function.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the automatically generated functions are OK, but not the most user-friendly ones with the right keyword argument support, and clear docs. So we made a decision to not to do so, instead:\r\n\r\n- Always only exposes function with positional arguments (PackedFunc) to the frontend, this simplifies the complexity and indirection in FFI \r\n- Always create a wrapper function for user-facing APIs, with clear doc-strings.\r\n\r\nWe believe that because it is usually one-liner to add such indirection and a lot of effort was spent in making clear docs, this simplified approach will not bring too much additional burden to the developers but helps our users by a lot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/450001679/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/450004152","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/2259#issuecomment-450004152","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2259","id":450004152,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MDAwNDE1Mg==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-26T18:18:18Z","updated_at":"2018-12-26T18:18:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@grwlf

I take a serious look, and there are still some problems that need to be resolved. \r\n\r\nThe key improvement this PR introduces is the ability to do unification on recursive data types, so when we Unify((?a, t1), (t2, ?b))```, ```?a``` will be resolved to t2 and ```?b``` will be resolved in t1. The current lazy update algorithm maintains a list of touched relations to types. See the following example\r\n\r\n```\r\nR1(?a, t1)\r\nR2((?a, ?b), ?c)\r\nR3(t2, ?c)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen the desirable relations(stored in TypeNode) are:\r\n- ?a : [R1, R2]\r\n- ?b : [R2]\r\n- ?c : [R2, R3]\r\n\r\nThe lazy update algorithm will add the relations to the update queue list when certain type get unified to another one. In our case, if we unify ```?a``` to ```t0```, then R1, R2 will be added to the queue.\r\n\r\nThe key problem now becomes how do we keep the relation list up to date. More importantly, how to do so when one incomplete type get unified to another one.\r\n\r\nThe previous logic of such update is done in https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/master/src/relay/pass/type_solver.h#L177. In particular, when we call\r\n```MergeFromTo(?c, ?a)```, we will add all the un-resolved relations in ?c, in this case, R2, R3 to ?a.

As @tqchen know, I am writing articles to introduce TVM to Chinese developers and wish to attract them to join us (see https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/50529704) . My next article will introduce one op of frozen model (like CoreML, Keras and so on) , then how to change into NNVM (Relay doesn't have frontend and I don't also be familiar with that， sorry about this), then how to be called into TVM, then how to become LLVM IR. I will walk through this by detail code (even the exact line) If @tqchen think this way (top -> down)  is also good, I will PR this go-through tutorial when I complete this Chinese version.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/450164489/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/450205412","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2346#issuecomment-450205412","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2346","id":450205412,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MDIwNTQxMg==","user":{"login":"derisavi","id":13456984,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDU2OTg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13456984?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/derisavi","html_url":"https://github.com/derisavi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derisavi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derisavi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derisavi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derisavi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derisavi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derisavi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derisavi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derisavi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derisavi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-27T18:27:29Z","updated_at":"2018-12-27T18:27:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Adding original reviewers @yzhliu @sgrechanik-h ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/450205412/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/450205700","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2310#issuecomment-450205700","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2310","id":450205700,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MDIwNTcwMA==","user":{"login":"derisavi","id":13456984,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDU2OTg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13456984?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/derisavi","html_url":"https://github.com/derisavi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derisavi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derisavi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derisavi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derisavi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derisavi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derisavi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derisavi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derisavi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derisavi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-27T18:29:29Z","updated_at":"2018-12-27T18:29:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I mistakenly removed my remote branch and that caused this PR to automatically close.
