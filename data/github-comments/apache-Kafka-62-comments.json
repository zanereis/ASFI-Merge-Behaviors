But I don't feel its value is worth the extra code here in this particular case. Adding unit tests for bug fixes is useful to make sure that we will not have the same bug again in the future. And it is generally for detecting bugs that is not evident by simply looking at the code.\n\nHowever, the bug fixed in this patch is really straightforward and shouldn't happen again if anyone change this method in the future. A unit test for this bug should validate that flushesInProgress is decremented in the event of InterruptedException, which is essentially testing the usage of `finally` than testing any kafka-specific logic. If we should add tests for something as straightforward as this, we should probably add test for a bunch of other methods that use `finally` to enforce something, which doesn't seem feasible.

Thanks for the explanation. I agree a test can be useful here. I am going to write test for this particular patch. But I would like to discuss it a bit more to understand the best practice for adding tests in kafka , which hopefully can encourage more contributions in the open source community.\n\nI think Kafka open source community should probably have a uniform standard for what should be tested. The standard should be enforced consistently for at least new patches. Bug is good for detecting something that were missed by originally developers and reviewers; once a bug is detected, we should start to require higher standard for tests by original developers so that similar issues can be covered in the future. Does this sound reasonable?\n\nFor this particular patch, I suppose that we can add a test like this: call `beginFlush`, call `awaitFlushCompletion`, interrupt the thread, and verify that `flushInProgress() == false`. Say it is useful to test it, should we similarly test that `appendsInProgress` does't change before and after `RecordAccumulator.append()`? Should all future developers who use `finally` to enforce that the statement in the finally is executed, to always verify this by writing tests for exceptions that may be thrown?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/216963551/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/216969290","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1315#issuecomment-216969290","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1315","id":216969290,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNjk2OTI5MA==","user":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-04T19:07:42Z","updated_at":"2016-05-04T19:07:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@zhuchen1018 I agree that it would be good to be consistent around this.

It's also a bit subjective what is worth testing and what isn't. However, a simple rule is that if we have a bug for something, we should include a test with the fix unless there is a good reason not to (test is brittle, takes too long, too complex, etc.).

It would be a fair rule to hold developers of the feature to no lower standard than those who help fix their code, right?\n\nIt would be good to take cost of time into account and be consistent about a standard for test since there will be growing number of these bug fixes moving forward.

I think we're going in circles a bit. I'll leave some thoughts and if you want to discuss the topic more generally, then please start a mailing list thread. So here it goes:\n- I think focusing on a language construct (`finally`) is perhaps the wrong way to think about it. Let's describe the issue as an interruptible method. It is a good idea to have a test that causes the method to be interrupted because this is a common source of bugs (examples are both the issue in this PR and in `ByteBuffer.allocate` where there were actually multiple bugs and PRs that you were involved with).\n- When someone contributes a new feature, they contribute a bunch of tests and the reviewer tries to ensure that the test coverage is good. This is a bit of a subjective thing at the moment as we don't yet use coverage tools (and they have limits as well). Things will be missed, that's just the nature of it.\n- When someone contributes a bug fix, there is evidence that a test would have been useful so we take that into account.\n- When someone files a PR, it's worth being aware that reviewer time is also limited. Your PR is more likely to be merged faster if it fits the project guidelines.\n- I hope that instead of a growing number of bug fixes, we write code with less bugs. We will see!\n\nOK, that's all I have to say for now. :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/217032745/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/217037222","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1311#issuecomment-217037222","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1311","id":217037222,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNzAzNzIyMg==","user":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-04T23:24:27Z","updated_at":"2016-05-04T23:24:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Tests passed locally.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/217037222/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/217044376","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1212#issuecomment-217044376","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1212","id":217044376,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNzA0NDM3Ng==","user":{"login":"junrao","id":132330,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjMzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/132330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-05T00:11:27Z","updated_at":"2016-05-05T00:11:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the patch.

It should be gross and broken, just like the lz4 encoding it's doing...\n\nBut anyways, I'll make the changes :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/217060404/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/217062808","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1212#issuecomment-217062808","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1212","id":217062808,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNzA2MjgwOA==","user":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-05T02:39:58Z","updated_at":"2016-05-05T02:41:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"We're going to have to live with the broken implementation for a long time.
