We don't use `Kill` message any more iirc.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/461654971/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/461721118","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/7586#issuecomment-461721118","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/7586","id":461721118,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MTcyMTExOA==","user":{"login":"Myasuka","id":1709104,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDkxMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1709104?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Myasuka","html_url":"https://github.com/Myasuka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Myasuka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Myasuka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Myasuka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Myasuka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Myasuka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Myasuka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Myasuka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Myasuka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Myasuka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-08T08:01:22Z","updated_at":"2019-02-08T08:01:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@StefanRRichter Thanks a lot for your reviewing. I'd try to summarize your idea and record my thoughts below:\r\n\r\n1. Configurable `PredefinedOptions` and `OptionsFactory`. In this PR, I support to configure `PredefinedOptions` but `OptionsFactory` just kept only interface as the same as before. Just as original JIRA talked, we could make `OptionsFactory` also configurable. \r\n1. Still two level hierarchy to parse RocksDB's options. In this PR, I previously introduced  `RocksDBCustomizedOptions` between `PredefinedOptions` and `OptionsFactory`. Actually, the role of `RocksDBCustomizedOptions` played could be acted as `OptionsFactory`. \r\n\r\nI think the default implementation of `OptionsFactory` could be achieved as the combination of `RocksDBCustomizedOptions#fromConfig(Configuration)`, `RocksDBCustomizedOptions#getDBOptions(DBOptions)` and `RocksDBCustomizedOptions#getColumnOptions(ColumnFamilyOptions)` in this PR. \r\n\r\nFrom what I understood, the behavior for users to configure only through `flink-conf.yaml` did not change from current PR committed, even though we would support configurable `OptionsFactory` then. They still configure these options introduced within current `RocksDBCustomizedOptions`, but we then translated the default implementation of `OptionsFactory`. Did I understand correctly?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/461721118/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/461729311","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/7470#issuecomment-461729311","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/7470","id":461729311,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MTcyOTMxMQ==","user":{"login":"yanghua","id":2283778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODM3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2283778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua","html_url":"https://github.com/yanghua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-08T08:38:38Z","updated_at":"2019-02-08T08:38:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@aljoscha This PR has conflicts before, I have rebased to the master branch.

I have a high level comment that I would suggest an approach that could be a bit similar to what I suggested for RocksDB `OptionFactory` in your other PR.\r\n\r\nInstead of offering a fixed set of compression options as an enum, why not have a method in which the user can do `setStreamCompressionDecorator(StreamCompressionDecorator)`? On top of that, we can also allow to specifiy this class in the flink-conf, and code overrides conf if both are present. Like this, user can introduce their own compression schemes and we are not limiting to snappy or lz4. Snappy and LZ4 would then remain as two ready-to-use implementations. We can annotate the old methods of setting compression as depricated. What do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/461778016/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/461783873","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6883#issuecomment-461783873","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6883","id":461783873,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MTc4Mzg3Mw==","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-08T12:11:21Z","updated_at":"2019-02-08T12:11:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"checkstyle:\r\n```\r\n01:08:26.782

With that, one could create a class implementing `TypeSerializerSnapshot` and use the `resolveSchemaCompatibility` method to take this into account and return \"compatibleAfterMigration\" and like that the states could be compatible.\r\n\r\n- Another problem is that the `context.getOperatorStateStore().getUnionListState()` method will create an empty state and will save the state descriptor even if it's empty. So when trying to migrate, even if the old state is empty, it would try to migrate it which will result in using the old migration system and result in incompatible state.\r\nFor this, one could first check whether there is an old state to recover or not, and only when there is one, try to migrate it.\r\n\r\n\r\nI managed to solved this two problems, but the bigger problem here is that the KafkaProducer does not have only the NextTransactionalIdHint state, it also have the ListState inherited from the `TwoPhaseCommitSinkFunction` which includes the `KafkaTransactionState` and `KafkaTransactionContext`. \r\n\r\nTaking the version from master branch which include an updated version of the `ContextStateSerializer` and `TransactionStateSerializer` implementing the `snapshotConfiguration` method,  one could adapt the TypeSerializer classes to Override the `resolveSchemaCompatibility` and also take into account the difference in class names prefixes and return \"compatibleAfterMigration\" when needed.\r\n\r\nWith this we wouldn't have anymore the \"org.apache.flink.util.StateMigrationException: The new state serializer for operator state must not be incompatible\" errors.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**BUT**, even when we could solve this part, the problem is that each KafkaProducer class have in their methods signature its own independent version of the `KafkaTransactionState` and `KafkaTransactionContext` and they cannot be cast to one another.\r\n\r\nClarifying, when the `initializeState` gets called in the Kafka Producer, this will call the same method in the parent class, which will try to recover the transactions and context. Here it will recover the Transactions from `KafkaProducer011` and try to call the `recoverAndCommit` method of the universal `KafkaProducer` but as the transaction class cannot be cast, this will fail:\r\n```\r\njava.lang.ClassCastException: org.apache.flink.streaming.connectors.kafka.FlinkKafkaProducer011$KafkaTransactionState cannot be cast to org.apache.flink.streaming.connectors.kafka.FlinkKafkaProducer$KafkaTransactionState\r\n\tat org.apache.flink.streaming.connectors.kafka.FlinkKafkaProducer.recoverAndCommit(FlinkKafkaProducer.java:99)\r\n\tat org.apache.flink.streaming.api.functions.sink.TwoPhaseCommitSinkFunction.recoverAndCommitInternal(TwoPhaseCommitSinkFunction.java:393)\r\n\tat org.apache.flink.streaming.api.functions.sink.TwoPhaseCommitSinkFunction.initializeState(TwoPhaseCommitSinkFunction.java:351)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think the only way be able to migrate this would be to have a common class for `KafkaTransactionState` and `KafkaTransactionContext` that would be used for both Flink KafkaProducer... but I'm not sure this could be done without breaking compatibility...\r\n\r\n\r\nI performed the necessary refactoring to have a common class for each of the states and this seems to solve the migration issue, I performed limited tests, so this could have still problems...\r\n\r\nThe final thing is that for this to work, one have to include both connectors dependencies `flink-connector-kafka-0.11_2.11` and `flink-connector-kafka_2.11`, which I expected to work without any issue... \r\nBut when I include both connectors in the job jar, I get an error in Kafka consumer side:\r\n```\r\njava.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.apache.flink.streaming.connectors.kafka.internal.KafkaConsumerThread.<init>(Lorg/slf4j/Logger;Lorg/apache/flink/streaming/connectors/kafka/internal/Handover;Ljava/util/Properties;Lorg/apache/flink/streaming/connectors/kafka/internals/ClosableBlockingQueue;Ljava/lang/String;JZLorg/apache/flink/metrics/MetricGroup;Lorg/apache/flink/metrics/MetricGroup;)V\r\n\tat org.apache.flink.streaming.connectors.kafka.internal.KafkaFetcher.<init>(KafkaFetcher.java:109)\r\n\tat org.apache.flink.streaming.connectors.kafka.FlinkKafkaConsumer.createFetcher(FlinkKafkaConsumer.java:240)\r\n\tat org.apache.flink.streaming.connectors.kafka.FlinkKafkaConsumerBase.run(FlinkKafkaConsumerBase.java:647)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWorth to say, I get this error even without the modifications in this PR...\r\nMaybe I'm doing something wrong... but if this latter issue could be solved and the refactoring I made is correct the migration may be possible...\r\n\r\nPlease take a look to my analysis and correct me if I'm wrong.\r\n\r\nAlso, you can take a look to the work I've done in https://github.com/EAlexRojas/flink/commit/3ef8328dffb076199776698add231684363615eb and https://github.com/EAlexRojas/flink/commit/8f6685a50c03c2a43cb3046b04f7190edbd3fe75\r\n\r\nRegards, \r\nEdward","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/461849076/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/461871322","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/7671#issuecomment-461871322","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/7671","id":461871322,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MTg3MTMyMg==","user":{"login":"flinkbot","id":46904574,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2OTA0NTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46904574?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/flinkbot","html_url":"https://github.com/flinkbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flinkbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flinkbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flinkbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flinkbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flinkbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flinkbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flinkbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flinkbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flinkbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-08T16:58:53Z","updated_at":"2019-02-08T16:58:53Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Thanks a lot for your contribution to the Apache Flink project.

recap the changes here:\r\n\r\n- Added a `SelfResolvingTypeSerializer` interface to facilitate redirecting compatibility checks to new snapshot classes.\r\n- `Tuple0Serializer`, `TupleSerializer`, `Tuple2CaseClassSerializer`, and `CaseClassSerializer` all implement the `SelfResolvingTypeSerializer`.\r\n- Because of that, `ensureCompatibility` on the `TupleSerializerBase` can be removed (and is removed in this PR), because the serializers themselves all redirect the compatibility checks themselves, and would therefore not rely on `TupleSerializerBase` anymore for the compatibility check.\r\n- A new concrete class `SpecificCaseClassSerializer` is added to replace `CaseClassSerializer`.\r\n- New snapshot classes `Tuple0SerializerSnapshot`, `TupleSerializerSnapshot`, and `Tuple2CaseClassSerializerSnapshot` and `SpecificCaseClassSerializerSnapshot` are added to replace the original `TupleSerializerConfigSnapshot`.\r\n- Scala Macro for generating case class serializers is touched to always return the new `SpecificCaseClassSerializer`, while still generating anonymous classes with same classnames (assured by tests) for backwards compatibility.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/462239675/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/462241019","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/7675#issuecomment-462241019","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/7675","id":462241019,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MjI0MTAxOQ==","user":{"login":"flinkbot","id":46904574,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2OTA0NTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46904574?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/flinkbot","html_url":"https://github.com/flinkbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flinkbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flinkbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flinkbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flinkbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flinkbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flinkbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flinkbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flinkbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flinkbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-11T07:47:13Z","updated_at":"2019-03-28T11:19:06Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Thanks

I am/was also in the process of discovering/fixing the same problems that you have mentioned and writing the tests for that. So far I have rewritten & fixed the tests provided by @tvielgouarin and encountered the same errors.\r\n\r\nTLDR;\r\nI'm thinking how to solve this situation, but I'm afraid it won't make it to 1.8...\r\n\r\nFull story:\r\nRegarding the 0.11 vs 2.0 dependency, having both of them in the same class path won't work because of the dependency convergence, but it doesn't have to. Committing/aborting 0.11 transactions with 2.0 connector should work fine, so that shouldn't be an issue.\r\n\r\nReal problem is that `FlinkKafkaProducer` and `FlinkKafkaProducer011` have different names and they defined static classes ` NextTransactionalIdHint`, `KafkaTransactionState` and `KafkaTransactionContext` inside the parent classes. This is causing incompatibility problems since for example `FlinkKafkaProducer011.KafkaTransactionState` and `FlinkKafkaProducer.KafkaTransactionState` are treated as completely incompatible classes, despite being identical.\r\n\r\nIt can probably be solved by:\r\n1. custom serialization logic, like keeping a fake/dummy `FlinkKafkaProducer011.XXXSerializer.XXXSerializerSnapshot` classes in the universal connector, as entry points for the deserialization\r\n2. Add a \"force skip class compatibility check\" flag to the current serialization stack. After all serialized binary data are exactly the same in all of those cases. This is work in progress by @tzulitai, this might happen in time for 1.8 release.\r\n3. Add a more powerful state migration function, that would be able to change type of a field/class. This is also on our road map, but won't happen in 1.8.\r\n\r\nEither way, unfortunately I'm away for next two weeks and I can not solve this issue before 1.8 feature freeze. This fix will have to wait for 1.9 release.\r\n\r\nI have implemented working regression tests for state compatibility between Flink versions: https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/7677\r\nTest for migration from 0.11 to universal connector is also easy to implement:\r\nhttps://github.com/pnowojski/flink/tree/kafka-migration-0.11-to-universal-not-working\r\nBut I didn't have time to make it work (as described above).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/462391160/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/462519667","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/7678#issuecomment-462519667","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/7678","id":462519667,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MjUxOTY2Nw==","user":{"login":"flinkbot","id":46904574,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2OTA0NTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46904574?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/flinkbot","html_url":"https://github.com/flinkbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flinkbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flinkbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flinkbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flinkbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flinkbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flinkbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flinkbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flinkbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flinkbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-11T22:25:14Z","updated_at":"2019-03-02T17:48:39Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Thanks a lot for your contribution to the Apache Flink project.

I think adding an interface that can extend to other connectors  and also not restricting consumers to use Guava's RateLimiter makes sense. Maybe something simple like below will work for the interface?\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic interface FlinkConnectorRateLimiter {\r\n\tpublic void open(StreamingRuntimeContext runtimeContext);\r\n\tpublic <T> T create(long rate);\r\n\tpublic void setRate(long rate);\r\n\tpublic void close();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAnd connector specific RateLimiters can be defined to implement this interface. \r\n\r\nAlso, point taken on keeping these discussions on the mailing list in the future.

I actually missed this PR and accidentally opened #7689. While porting the tests, I think that we can completely remove the `SlotSharingITCase`, since the test is no longer valid. If you remove the slot sharing groups the test would pass with the new code because of the queued scheduling. The only test which I would port is the `CoLocationConstraintITCase`  (#7690).\r\n\r\nMoreover, with #7676 I added some functionality for terminating and starting new `TaskExecutors` for the `MiniCluster`.\r\n\r\nI also think that `TaskManagerFailsWithSlotSharingITCase` should simply be removed since it is the same as the #7676 just with slot sharing. One could argue that slot sharing is the more common case and, therefore should be used. But then we should simply adapt #7676.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/463109196/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
