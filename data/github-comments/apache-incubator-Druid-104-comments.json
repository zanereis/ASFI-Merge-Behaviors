Since Druid explodes multi-value dimensions when grouping, that means you get the cross product out.\n\nI think what you're looking for is for Druid to treat 'value' as something derived from 'key' and not as a separate independent dimension. You might be able to do that with a custom extraction function that does basically `f(x) = x + \":\" + lookup(x)`, and then only including the extracted dimension in your grouping (not the original one).

The way you provide them in the query (two separate dimensions) tells Druid they should be treated independently. IMO if they should be treated as a unit, they should be provided as one dimension, which points towards the extraction function \"workaround\" as actually being a good approach, since that is one dimension rather than two.\n\nI wonder what's sad about it? Would it be less sad if we could return `\"kv\" : {\"k\": \"k1\", \"v\": \"v1\"}` rather than `\"kv\": \"k1:v1\"`?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/243811388/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/243811852","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/3414#issuecomment-243811852","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3414","id":243811852,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MzgxMTg1Mg==","user":{"login":"drcrallen","id":8213081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMTMwODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8213081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen","html_url":"https://github.com/drcrallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-31T15:59:30Z","updated_at":"2016-08-31T15:59:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@gvsmirnov can you see if https://github.com/druid-io/druid/issues/3367 captures your needs adequately? it would be worth commenting there that you have a use-case for multi-value dimensions.

Now you could have the whole object as a string and then do some perversions for filtering and then splitting etc. Another part of the sadness is that I don't see a way to prepend the original Id besides putting it in the lookup source data (e.g. a kafka topic would contain mappings like `key1->key1:value1`), which is sad in itself. Or am I missing a way to do the prepending without it?\n\n@drcrallen partially it would, yes. But consider the case where the object looked up has multiple properties that the user wants to filter by. A nice approach would be to have them all as separately looked-up dimensions.\n\nSince from the query it's obvious that multiple output dimensions are based on the same dimension in the source data, then Druid can be nice enough to avoid cross-producting the dimension essentially with itself multiple times.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/243816755/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/243817657","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/3414#issuecomment-243817657","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3414","id":243817657,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MzgxNzY1Nw==","user":{"login":"gvsmirnov","id":1493464,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTM0NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1493464?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gvsmirnov","html_url":"https://github.com/gvsmirnov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gvsmirnov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gvsmirnov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gvsmirnov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gvsmirnov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gvsmirnov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gvsmirnov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gvsmirnov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gvsmirnov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gvsmirnov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-31T16:18:13Z","updated_at":"2016-08-31T16:18:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Also a part of the sadness of the workaround: if you want the looked-up value to match exactly to `xyz`, you cannot use a simple `selector` filter.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/243817657/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/243817913","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/3414#issuecomment-243817913","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3414","id":243817913,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MzgxNzkxMw==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-31T16:19:05Z","updated_at":"2016-08-31T16:19:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@gvsmirnov putting the key in the source lookup is probably not the best way to go, for the all reasons you mentioned (extra data in kafka, interferes with filtering, can't be disabled, etc‚Ä¶).

you wanted to do the extractionFn options, they could be added to RegisteredLookupExtractionFn, LookupExtractionFn, and LookupDimensionSpec (the three internal ways lookups can get used). It might be nice to generalize them a bit, i.e. rather than having keyDelimiter, instead have a \"format string\" that could be something like \"%k:%v\" or \"%v (%k)\" or whatever. Perhaps also an option to escape keys/values to handle the case where it's not possible to select an un-ambiguous format string.\n\nI think your multiOutput suggestion is not implementable right now, since dimension values currently need to be strings.
