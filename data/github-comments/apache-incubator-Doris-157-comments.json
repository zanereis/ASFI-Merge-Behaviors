Gives the performance impact of `disable page cache` and `disable chunk allocator`, and the benefits of doing so, such as increasing OOM risk because they have no gc.\r\n\r\n1. Currently, we use a hard limit for page cache(20%) or chunk allocator(10%), if the application need memory, there is no gc mechanism to collect memory from page cache or chunk allocator.\r\n2. page cache is very useful in some cases such as POC test, run benchmarks, some reporting secenarios. But in some cases like adhoc query, etl query, it is not very useful. And we have disable page cache in 1.1 and many company have disable page cache online such as xiaomi.\r\n3. chunk allocator impacts about 10% performance in clickbench test. \r\n\r\nDoris's memory usage is not very stable, I want to disable them first, and try to fix other memory problems and then open them again. This may need about 2 months and there are many releases during this stage, so that I disable them  like we have done in branch

I have a little question is that when will a user want to delete stats of some partitions rather than whole table, just curious\r\n\r\nThis is mainly related to the statistics of partition granularity. partition statistics is mainly used for queries that contain partitions. This statistics is more useful if the partition statistics involved can be used instead of all other partition statistics. In addition, we can also collect statistics incrementally by partition, etc.\r\n\r\nComing back to your question, I feel that partition statistics may need to be removed in this scenario. For example, a table has been collected statistics, but the partition time is a long time ago, then you can delete this \"expired\" partition statistics separately. Also, if the partition data is changed, then it's statistics is invalid and can be deleted. Of course, there are other ways to solve similar problems, if not necessary, it can be removed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/1275765669/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/1275819813","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/13311#issuecomment-1275819813","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/13311","id":1275819813,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBfSlxs5MC3cl","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-12T08:53:28Z","updated_at":"2022-10-12T08:53:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"PR
