I just updated the patch to address the latest comments. One thing worth mentioning is that dumping the active time index may be slow because time index requires looking up the offset index. The offset index of the active segment is always the max index size. This will cause the dump log segment tool to create an offset index with a lot of empty index entries in the end so the binary search in this case does not quite work. Also because the active segment is still growing, dumping it may have some race condition and result in false alarm. So I suppose it is fine to assume that people won't dump the active log segment.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/232879331/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/232884261","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1606#issuecomment-232884261","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1606","id":232884261,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMjg4NDI2MQ==","user":{"login":"kawamuray","id":2255161,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUxNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2255161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kawamuray","html_url":"https://github.com/kawamuray","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kawamuray/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kawamuray/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kawamuray/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kawamuray/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kawamuray/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kawamuray/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kawamuray/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kawamuray/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kawamuray/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-15T07:38:56Z","updated_at":"2016-07-15T07:38:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ijuma

would be great to be able to print topologies at two different stages.  If we call print/toString() on the topology builder, then we'd be able to see what the topology looks like at a high level (which sub-topologies read from which topics and write to other topics and what state stores are used).  At this step, the topology is not yet running so we would not see how many tasks or partitions yet but this is still useful.\n\nCalling print/toString() on the running KafkaStreams object it what's already here and can be helpful for seeing how things got scheduled at runtime.
