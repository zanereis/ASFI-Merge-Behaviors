noticed one bug in `RecordAccumulator` which _might_ explain the problem. The issue is this line: https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/producer/internals/RecordAccumulator.java#L584. We should be holding a lock when we call `isEmpty()`. If this call had returned true incorrectly, then we would have proceeded to send the COMMIT and only afterwards would the batches be sent. This could cause us to transition to READY with produce requests still in progress. If those requests failed, then we might attempt to transition to ABORTABLE_ERROR when they return. I'm not totally sure that the sequence is possible, but might be worth fixing just to rule it

@ijuma it looks like the difference in execution time is non-trivial 21.5 min with all logging disabled vs 27.5 min with that patch. Unfortunately it will probably take some experimentation to figure out which of the changes has the most impact (if any of them even dominate).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/308619028/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/308619521","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/3332#issuecomment-308619521","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/3332","id":308619521,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwODYxOTUyMQ==","user":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-15T03:37:10Z","updated_at":"2017-06-15T03:37:10Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@ewencp if I had to guess, it would be the request logging.

I don't know log4j that well, but it should probably be possible to turn that logging on for one targeted test.
