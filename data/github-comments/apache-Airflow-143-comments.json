So it may not be necessary to merge this into Airflow.\r\n\r\nI think it would be useful to identify the failed job in the Airflow error message, which is something that this commit accomplishes (we have already found it useful in our deployments at Etsy).

I was traveling when you added this feature so I didn't get around to it until now. A few thoughts:\r\n(1) looking at datasets.py, qualified name could be None. I didn't test it out, but I assume this would render a blank node in the view. perhaps qualified_name should be a required field.\r\n(2) is `auto`'s behavior recursive? if I have A-> B-> C , and B does nothing to the dataset, can I have both B and C inlet set to 'auto', and have C pick up lineage from A? (and maybe this would mean having 'auto' for outlets as well?)\r\n(3) should be able to turn this feature on/off, or generate lineage in a separate view. We don't have a strong use-case for it for now, and I can see a scenario where some of the operators have their inlets/outlets automatically set in the constructor (to save end users from manually setting them). This would result in incomplete lineage views and may be confusing for users who are not familiar with the feature. (ideally, all inlets/outlets should be generated automatically, but that's a lot of effort and require going through each operator, so it'll take some times to get there).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/395274553/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/395279451","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3469#issuecomment-395279451","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3469","id":395279451,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NTI3OTQ1MQ==","user":{"login":"renzofrigato","id":39929712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5OTI5NzEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39929712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/renzofrigato","html_url":"https://github.com/renzofrigato","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renzofrigato/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renzofrigato/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renzofrigato/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renzofrigato/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renzofrigato/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renzofrigato/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renzofrigato/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renzofrigato/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renzofrigato/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-07T03:15:50Z","updated_at":"2018-06-07T03:15:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jgao54 Github uses `github.com` for the oauth calls and  `api.github.com` for the API calls (like fetching user info). This means that if I set `host=https://api.github.com` as you suggest, the oauth requests would fail.\r\nIt may be possible to create a new configuration variable like `api_host` or something similar but it seemed a little overkill just for this use case.
