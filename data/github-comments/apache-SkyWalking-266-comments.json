I am sure this pattern is not being used in other storage implementation.\r\n\r\nThe reason to introduce the `AbstractBanyanDBDeserializer` is that the storage build for BanyanDB is asymmetric, i.e. what we write is several lists of `SerializableTag`s while we read `TagAndValue` from database. Both of these lists are strictly ordered which should comply with the order of schema definition and the order of projection declaration.\r\n\r\nAnother motivation is that default implementation of `storageBuilder` within the DAO is less performant since binary data is always encoded to the base64 format which is not necessary in the case of BanyanDB. We natively support binary data format.\r\n\r\nBesides, I suppose it is not necessary to fetch the full storage entity as an intermediate representation while querying. We could do the projection to reduce bandwidth usage.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/986654210/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/986660668","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/7875#issuecomment-986660668","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/7875","id":986660668,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArmls846zz88","user":{"login":"DominikHubacek","id":38406642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDA2NjQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38406642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DominikHubacek","html_url":"https://github.com/DominikHubacek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DominikHubacek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DominikHubacek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DominikHubacek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DominikHubacek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DominikHubacek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DominikHubacek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DominikHubacek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DominikHubacek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DominikHubacek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-06T10:52:48Z","updated_at":"2021-12-06T10:52:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi,
