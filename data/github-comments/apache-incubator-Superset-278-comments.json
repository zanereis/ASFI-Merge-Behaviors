A couple of points:\r\n\r\n @villebro is correct, SQLite is not a production-ready datastore, so this should only affect development setups for the vast majority of organizations. Migrating a development setup to our dockerized system should not require bringing development data along for the ride. I don't foresee many (if any) having to transition metadata databases as a result of this change. \r\n\r\nYou'll notice that there is a deprecation period for the SQLite support - it will not be yanked immediately. If we hear feedback during that time that organizations will need support migrating the data to a different datastore it will be a good idea to provide a migration path to the community.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your enthusiasm. One minor process point is important here though - only Apache Software Foundation committers are able to vote on SIPs. I myself am not yet a committer, so I have no ability to vote yea or nea on this proposal.\r\n\r\nDoes your organization use SQLite in production?

Seems like that url is exposed in FAB and I don't really understand how that works right now. \r\n\r\n>column labels are not translated\r\n\r\nI've updated the code to use the `label_columns` data provided by the backend. Looks like we're missing some translations there. \r\n\r\n>Button labels are not translated\r\n\r\nI've updated the code to use the `t('....')` function from superset-ui/translation which seems to be the way of handling translations on the frontend. We're also likely missing most translations there. \r\n\r\n>Edit form back button does not work work properly (previous MVC), I would say that it's only usable when using modal forms form add and edit\r\n\r\nThis is true. looks like that links to `/back` which appears to be an endpoint in FAB? Somehow it's redirecting back to the charts list. Not sure how that works or how it's configured. -- There's work being done to move that functionality to a modal so that could be the workaround solution for that issue.

Currently filter box and time table is also from custom plugin folder. We will need to make a custom plugin folder call PivotTable which should look similar to `superset/assets/node_modules/@superset-ui/legacy-plugin-chart-pivot-table`.Then we can edit the `PivotTable.js` inside our custom folder","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/573908382/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/573924221","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/8946#issuecomment-573924221","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/8946","id":573924221,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MzkyNDIyMQ==","user":{"login":"robdiciuccio","id":296227,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjIyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/296227?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robdiciuccio","html_url":"https://github.com/robdiciuccio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robdiciuccio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robdiciuccio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robdiciuccio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robdiciuccio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robdiciuccio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robdiciuccio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robdiciuccio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robdiciuccio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robdiciuccio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-13T23:31:01Z","updated_at":"2020-01-13T23:31:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@graceguo-supercat I tested with the following table and data in our Presto (Hive) cluster, and was unable to replicate the error.\r\n\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE default.superset_test (\r\n  id bigint,\r\n  name varchar,\r\n  list_ints array(bigint),\r\n  list_maps array(map(varchar, varchar)),\r\n  map1 map(varchar, varchar),\r\n  map2 map(varchar, boolean),\r\n  ds date\r\n);\r\n\r\nINSERT INTO default.superset_test VALUES (1, 'San Francisco', ARRAY[1,2,3], ARRAY[MAP(ARRAY['foo'], ARRAY['bar']), MAP(ARRAY['fad'], ARRAY['baz'])], MAP(ARRAY['foo'], ARRAY['bar']), MAP(ARRAY['foo'], ARRAY[True]), date '2019-01-09');\r\n\r\nselect * from default.superset_test;\r\n```\r\n\r\n<img width=\"791\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-01-13 at 3 29 56 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/296227/72300764-9465c000-3619-11ea-8402-94de5549782a.png\">\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/573924221/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":1,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/573940428","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/8961#issuecomment-573940428","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/8961","id":573940428,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3Mzk0MDQyOA==","user":{"login":"issue-label-bot[bot]","id":48611044,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDg2MTEwNDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/27079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/issue-label-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-14T00:29:23Z","updated_at":"2020-01-14T00:29:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Issue-Label Bot is automatically applying the label `#bug` to this issue, with a confidence of 0.92.
