Do you have a use case? What do u need in the API to achieve it?\r\n\r\nI do not necessarily have a use case, but was trying to understand the API contracts. It sounds like something that should be either explicitly supported or not supported by the API (i.e., without having to introduce a backward incompatibility in the future to support it), and probably we should show a pathway for this API to be compatible with the spec.\r\n\r\nAs a follow up, in case both multiple representations could share the same version, and additional representations could end up with a new version, semantically what does a new version mean? Is it an addition to the previous version, or a replacement? For example, if I add the Spark representation in one version and the equivalent Trino representation in another (same query but with different syntax), is it allowed? Should Spark queries start to fail?\r\n\r\n> Yes. The current view builder only supports SQLViewRepresentation. For other representations, one idea is to add more withXXX methods. Any suggestion?\r\n\r\nJust making sure that `withQuery` is the one that signifies the `SQLViewRepresentation`. It sounded there was another source to express the fact that it is a SQL view (e.g., the fact that the dialect is Spark). Would be good to find out how to normalize those things (so there are not two independent hints about the same representation).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1284470303/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1284518979","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/5993#issuecomment-1284518979","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/5993","id":1284518979,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85MkDRD","user":{"login":"gar3thjon3s","id":5753,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5753?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gar3thjon3s","html_url":"https://github.com/gar3thjon3s","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gar3thjon3s/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gar3thjon3s/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gar3thjon3s/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gar3thjon3s/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gar3thjon3s/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gar3thjon3s/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gar3thjon3s/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gar3thjon3s/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gar3thjon3s/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-19T20:10:46Z","updated_at":"2022-10-19T20:10:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"It's a typo in the docker-compose.yml file - I had the same problem:\r\n\r\nreplace `PYSPARK_PYTON` -> `PYSPARK_PYTHON`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1284518979/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1284715472","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2276#issuecomment-1284715472","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2276","id":1284715472,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85MkzPQ","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-19T23:55:44Z","updated_at":"2022-10-26T21:28:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rdblue @sunchao, I am wondering about storage-partitioned joins if we have more than one spec.\r\n\r\nWhenever there are multiple specs in a table, we usually compute a common partition type, which represents a union of all specs in the table. If a file belongs to a partition spec that did not include a particular partition column in the common partition type, we would mark it as null.\r\n\r\n```\r\nColumns: c1, c2, c3, c4, c5\r\nSpec 1: part1 as identity(c1)\r\nSpec 2: part1 as identity(c1), part2 as identity(c2)\r\n\r\nFile A written with spec 1: (part1 = 'Q', part2 = null) // part2 is null as part2 is not part of spec 1\r\nFile B written with spec 2: (part1 = 'Q', part2 = 'W') // part2 is set as it is part of spec 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow suppose we have a target table that has two partition specs:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSpec 1: identity(c1), identity(c2)\r\nSpec 2: identity(c1), identity(c2), identity(c3)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd a source table with only one spec:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSpec 1: `identity(c1)`, `identity(c2)`, `identity(c3)`\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n- target table -\r\nFile T_A (part1 = A, part2 = A, part3 = null) (c3 values are random) (uses old spec with 2 columns)\r\nFile T_B (part1 = A, part2 = A, part3 = 5) (c3 values are all 5) (uses new spec with 3 columns)\r\nFile T_C (part1 = A, part2 = A, part3 = null) (c3 values are all null) (uses new spec with 3 columns)\r\n\r\n- source table - \r\nFile S_A (part1 = A, part2 = A, part3 = 5) (c3 values are all 5) (uses new spec with 3 columns)\r\nFile S_B (part1 = A, part2 = A, part3 = null) (c3 values are all null) (uses new spec with 3 columns)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSpark will treat `T_A` and and `S_B` as splits that belong to the same partition even though it may not be safe if the join condition includes `t.c3 = s.c3`.\r\n\r\nIt seems we can report `KeyGroupPartitioning` to Spark only on columns that were present in all partition specs that are being queried.

so in the case of non-storage partition join, the random values of `c3` in file `T_A` will be used if we have a join condition like `t.c3 = s.c3`, instead of `null`, is that correct? seems in this case the column `c3` of the target table evolved from a non-partition column to a partition column.\r\n\r\nAlso for file `T_A`, the method `ContentFile.partition` will return `(part 1 = A, part2 = A)`?\r\n\r\n> It seems we can report KeyGroupPartitioning to Spark only on columns that were present in all partition specs that are being queried. Any thoughts?\r\n\r\nI think this probably is a safe solution. We can also derive the common columns after Iceberg has done partition pruning, so in that case if the file `F_A` is not selected as result of pruning, we can still report `c1`, `c2` and `c3` to Spark.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1285799673/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1285863344","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/5989#issuecomment-1285863344","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/5989","id":1285863344,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85MpLew","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-20T16:48:06Z","updated_at":"2022-10-20T16:48:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@pavibhai, this looks reasonable to me.

Hopefully next week will put a design doc up.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1287267038/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1287267780","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/4127#issuecomment-1287267780","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4127","id":1287267780,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85MuiXE","user":{"login":"szehon-ho","id":20555759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTU1NzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20555759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho","html_url":"https://github.com/szehon-ho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-21T17:50:16Z","updated_at":"2022-10-21T17:50:16Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Note , plan to put a design doc up next week for this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1287267780/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1287381115","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4606#issuecomment-1287381115","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4606","id":1287381115,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85Mu-B7","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-21T19:59:35Z","updated_at":"2022-10-21T19:59:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"These changes were merged in #6020.

But I guess it is fine since `VectorizedArrowReader::setRowGroupInfo()` doesn't consume the `rowPosition`, which means it still works fine even `rowPosition` is off. The problem happens only if we want to rely on the row positions. https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/5688d59f6b8ea4784de1f45c9386e13618803673/arrow/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/arrow/vectorized/VectorizedArrowReader.java#L396\r\n\r\nBy digging a bit more, `ReadConf.columnChunkMetadataForRowGroups` keeps the row group metadata. Wondering if we can calculate the row positions while generating the `columnChunkMetadataForRowGroups`, so that the row position will always be correct and we don't have to read the metadata twice.

I think that's confusing enough that we have so far chosen to not add this \"feature\" to the format.\r\n> \r\n> If we want to change that decision, we'll need to document this in the spec and define compatibility rules across spec versions.\r\n\r\nThanks for pointing out the issue.
