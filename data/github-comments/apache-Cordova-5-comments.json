I expect that this should resolve the reported issue for most if not all users. Here is the recommended procedure to update both the Cordova tooling and Cordova project:\r\n\r\n- remove existing installation of Cordova by the following command: `npm uninstall -g cordova`, or use a manager such as nvm or the cross-platform [`jasongin/nvs`](https://github.com/jasongin/nvs) to start with a fresh new installation of Node.js\r\n- install Cordova tooling again by the following command: `npm install -g cordova`\r\n- in the Cordova app project:\r\n  - do the following command for each platform: `cordova platform rm <platform name>`\r\n  - completely remove the following artifacts: `package-lock.json`, `node_modules`, and `platforms` directory\r\n  - it is optional but recommended to completely remove the `plugins` directory as well\r\n  - double-check that there is no remaining configuration of `cordova-common` or any of the Cordova platforms in `config.xml` or `package.json`\r\n  - try adding and building for each desired platform, as documented\r\n\r\nThis may be extra pedantic, but I would recommend this procedure to hopefully ensure a zero chance of using an old version of `cordova-common`.\r\n\r\nI would like to update the other packages (`cordova-create`, `cordova-fetch`, `cordova-lib`, `cordova-electron`, and `cordova-windows`) to use fs-extra@8.

your machine by runing `git clone https://github.com/apache/cordova-common.git`\r\n\r\n- `cd` to the cloned directory and run `npm install` to download the required dependencies.\r\n\r\n- After you
