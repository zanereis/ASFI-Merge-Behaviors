Actually there are two ways to realize broadcast semantics. The first way is via `RecordWriter#broadcastEmit()` as you realized in this PR. The other way is via `RecordWriter#emit(BroadcastChannelSelector)`, and in current `StreamNetworkBenchmarkEnvironment#createRecordWriter` we only define the `RoundRobinChannelSelector` for the writer. If we make the `ChannelSelector` as a parameter, we can also support other partitioner modes, such as `rebalance`, `forward`, etc. How do you consider these two ways?\r\n\r\n2. Do we need make the var `broadcastMode` as `@Param({\"true\",\"false\"})` for covering the existing tests in `StreamNetworkThroughputBenchmarkTest`?

Those are less frequent, thus not that performance critical. If we want want to cover only one of those, we should cover the usage with `BroadcastPartitioner`. However it might be indeed best to cover both of them?\r\n\r\nRegarding adding a  `@Param` to existing benchmarks - I didn't want to do that, because that would add more time overhead when executing benchmarks. Also I do not see a that big value with benchmarking  broadcasting with all of the other parameters combination. The most common `100ms` and `100` channels should be enough. Also I have refactored the tests and `StreamNetworkBroadcastThroughputBenchmarkTest` executes the same tests as `StreamNetworkThroughputBenchmarkTest` (one extends from the other).\r\n\r\nI wanted to merge this benchmark before merging your improvement in order to see the speed up in our continuous benchmarking charts. I hope that I didn't duplicate your work :/ ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/421935662/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/421937722","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6567#issuecomment-421937722","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6567","id":421937722,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMTkzNzcyMg==","user":{"login":"klion26","id":1425623,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjU2MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1425623?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/klion26","html_url":"https://github.com/klion26","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klion26/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klion26/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klion26/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klion26/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klion26/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klion26/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klion26/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klion26/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klion26/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-17T09:10:48Z","updated_at":"2018-09-17T09:10:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for opening this PR @yanghua , as a user, I like the idea fail in JM other than TM","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/421937722/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/421939190","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6697#issuecomment-421939190","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6697","id":421939190,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMTkzOTE5MA==","user":{"login":"zhijiangW","id":12387855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzg3ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12387855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW","html_url":"https://github.com/zhijiangW","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-17T09:16:03Z","updated_at":"2018-09-17T09:16:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I agree with your above points.\r\n1.
