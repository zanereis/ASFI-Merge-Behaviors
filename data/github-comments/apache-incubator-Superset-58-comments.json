speed is an issue as pandas.read_csv is single-threaded, an alternative is `paratext` https://github.com/wiseio/paratext. the load_csv_to_pandas function is using all cores and is much faster than pandas.\r\nIt doesn't solve the whole memory issue though: while it's quite efficient while reading and processing the CSV, the last conversion to pandas dataframe will use as much memory as pandas alone.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/282787337/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/282798044","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/2266#issuecomment-282798044","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/2266","id":282798044,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4Mjc5ODA0NA==","user":{"login":"vera-liu","id":20978302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTc4MzAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20978302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vera-liu","html_url":"https://github.com/vera-liu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vera-liu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vera-liu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vera-liu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vera-liu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vera-liu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vera-liu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vera-liu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vera-liu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vera-liu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-27T17:58:19Z","updated_at":"2017-02-27T17:58:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"this

Nishant,\n\n\n\nOn my POC environment,\n\nDruid broker and coordinator configured properly on superset. as per troubleshooting  figure out broker node unable to resolve historical node ec2 private ip address than replaced private ip address with hostname. on broker node logs historical node still showing same errror. that time i suspect DNS issue may be causing this problem. for verification historical node private ip address mapped on broker node hosts file and restarted service on both node historical and broker node.\n\n\nhistorical node\n\ndruid.host=historical (planning to use DNS name for all node through ansible)\ndruid.service=/druid/historical\ndruid.port=8083\n\nBroker node\ndruid.host=ec2-xx-xx-xx-xxx.compute-1.amazonaws.com

entry\n10.x.x.10          historical\n\n\nafter adding  my issue resolved. now i am able to query all my data source. i am still working on scaling of my entire configuration through
