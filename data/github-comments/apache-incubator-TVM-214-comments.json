We probably should only benchmark the sample initial population part and compare the actual speedup with idea speedup.\r\n> We then can know how effective the parallelization is.\r\n\r\nGood suggestion, from the tuning log I can see it reduced from an average of 2~3 seconds:\r\n```\r\nA CUDA test from the master branch\r\n...\r\nSample Initial Population       #s: 456 fail_ct: 2048   Time elapsed: 2.60\r\n```\r\nto an average of 0.05~0.5 seconds:\r\n```\r\nThe same test from this branch(This even tried more populations)\r\n...\r\nSample Initial Population       #s: 648 fail_ct: 3448   Time elapsed: 0.17\r\n```\r\non my server. cc @FrozenGene \r\n\r\nAnd I'm thinking about maybe the Evolutionary Search part can also benefit from parallel_for in the same way? @merrymercy @comaniac
