@ydai1124 @cwsteinbach updated 99035f7\n\nMain changes:\n- Use a pool of `HiveMetaStoreClient`s instead of a single `HiveMetaStoreClient`, because `HiveMetaStoreClient` doesn't seem to support concurrent requests.\n- Added a striped lock class (`HiveStripedLocks`) as suggested by @cwsteinbach \n- When creating a table/partition, if the table/partition already exists, it checks whether the table or partition needs to be altered (`needToUpdateTable` and `needToUpdatePartition`). For example, update is needed if there's a schema change.

@chavdar We have seen a similar race which was causing our yarn gobblin jobs to fail.  What it looked like was the TaskStateCollectorService was trying to read a sequence file that had not been completely written.  We added retries to the deserialize and that seemed to fix it.  I haven't yet been able to completely verify the fix so I haven't created a PR for it.\n\n@zliu41 Can you share the pertinent info for those of us who can't access jira?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/181621878/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/181622951","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/677#issuecomment-181622951","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/677","id":181622951,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MTYyMjk1MQ==","user":{"login":"zliu41","id":6342538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNDI1Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6342538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41","html_url":"https://github.com/zliu41","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-08T23:33:17Z","updated_at":"2016-02-08T23:33:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@kadaan In `FsStateStore.put()`, when it calls `SequenceFile.createWriter`,\nthe TaskState file will be created immediately.
