If we have a scenario that can reliably reproduce this, I can likely find an HDFS expert to give us some context on what is happened at the HDFS layer.

I don't know how to write that context up.   I would be happy to add anything you write up or you could write up a following blog post and I can review it.   I am thinking we can build up a body of useful info and ideas w/ blog post, and blog post can reference other post to avoid repeating contextual info.\n\nFor the improvements sections I was also thinking of mentioning that another possible solution to this would be to use the multiple tservers per node you added AND a custom balancer that assigns tablets based on durability settings.  However I decided not add this information because I though it would take too much to explain well.  This could also be another blog post. I was not really sure what to do this idea... I couldn't even decided if it was a good a idea or not.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/257318930/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/257344563","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/177#issuecomment-257344563","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/177","id":257344563,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NzM0NDU2Mw==","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-31T16:32:50Z","updated_at":"2016-10-31T16:32:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Can you still create `#section` links when the manual is in the iframe?\n\nWe actually publish the manual to Maven Central.

It adds complexity to the site layout, and maintenance. It also has some side-effects: Links directly to the manual (which includes all of the links inside the manuals themselves) will still go to the raw, unwrapped version. It also makes it harder for users to right-click (or Ctrl-S) to save a copy of the manual.\n\nWhile those issues aren't insurmountable, and the windowed look does look nice enough so far as it goes, I think maybe it's better to just open the manual in a separate window/tab. That's a much simpler way to address the navigation issue, is a much smaller change, and requires far less maintenance.

Gigantic summaries will stymie this goal.\n- When a users summarizer does produce a gigantic summary, it would be nice if we helped them debug it.\n\nI am thinking one way to accomplish these goals is to store gigantic summaries, but only read summaries under a certain size.  The size of a serialized summary could be written first.  When a summary is read this size will be the first bit of info.  If the summary is over a certain size an error could be logged and that file would be treated like it had no summary.  We could also add a enum that indicates gigantic summaries were present.  Since the summary is stored, it would give the user a chance to use rfile-info to look at whats in the summary for debugging.\n\nWe also need to stress in the javadoc that summaries are intended to be small.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/259434767/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/259526146","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/182#issuecomment-259526146","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/182","id":259526146,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1OTUyNjE0Ng==","user":{"login":"joshelser","id":67863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3ODYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser","html_url":"https://github.com/joshelser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-09T21:04:02Z","updated_at":"2016-11-09T21:04:02Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"LGTM!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/259526146/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/259527021","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/182#issuecomment-259527021","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/182","id":259527021,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1OTUyNzAyMQ==","user":{"login":"phrocker","id":1781585,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODE1ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1781585?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phrocker","html_url":"https://github.com/phrocker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phrocker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phrocker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phrocker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phrocker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phrocker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phrocker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phrocker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phrocker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phrocker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-09T21:08:15Z","updated_at":"2016-11-09T21:08:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks
