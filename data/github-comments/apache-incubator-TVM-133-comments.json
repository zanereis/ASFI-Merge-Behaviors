Awesome solution! Just curios: for shapes which are worse than cudnn/cublas, what kind of tuning is using?\r\n\r\nGood point! We do have some internal discussions about whether we need to automatically search the schedule space based on performance between TensorCore and non-TensorCore kernel, since TensorCore implementation may not beat the non-TensorCore version for every shapes. This is one of the plan-to-do features and any further comments and inputs are also welcome. One possible solution is to expose TensorCore as another schedule configuration knob to let auto-tuner decide whether we need to turn it on or not. Another potential solution is that in the IR pass we decide on whether a certain shape may perform better with TensorCore with heuristics. There are pros and cons with both solution. For the former one, the tuner space will be enlarged, thus bringing a little bit larger tuning space. For the latter one, since we make decision in the IR pass internally, the tuner space is kept almost the same however introduce dependency upon the accuracy of the heuristics, although for TensorCore due it is hardware nature we think it might be clear to decide whether a shape is performance friendly for TensorCore or not, there is still possibility that we may choose a low-performance kernel.

The use of ```new_expr``` was convenient, but never the less a bit too close to low level and overlaps with what we can do with special memory scope.  Adding ```new_expr``` to Realize seems to enforce that decision even earlier, which I would not recommend.\r\n\r\nHere is an alternative solution: introduce a new scope for the special memory needed for lowering, then the special rule can be used to generate the corresponding memory needed.  Of course there could be additional hints that are needed to lower the the allocation code, you can likely embed that additional information with a special AttrStmt outside the allocation scope.\r\n\r\n## Place of Pattern Matching \r\n\r\nRight now from the reading of RFC, seems the early pattern matching was done before flattening and was dependent on the compute structure.\r\n\r\nI wonder if we could de-couple this, with some annotations, run some of the rewriting after storage flatten. Of course the low-level code does not enjoy the benefit of the multi-dimension indices, but the access pattern can still be detected by DetectLinearEquation.\r\n\r\nOne possible limitation I see the current approach is that whether we could support operations like conv2d, as we will need to explicitly express compute in this form(which is fine for now).\r\n\r\n## Complement and Combine with Tensor Intrinsics based TensorCore support\r\n\r\nIt would be great to hear from more thoughts @Hzfengsy @minminsun about how can we combine the tensor intrinsics based approach with the more automatic pattern detector one. e.g \r\n https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/issues/4052.\r\n\r\nWe always tries to have a philosophy to enable the manual scheduling options that can gives us a way to specify search space, then build automation on top. This allows us to takes a spectrum of approach, use more manual one if necessary, and build more diverse automated solution.\r\n\r\nOur eventual goal would still be unify all tensorization support under tensor intrinsics, and build automation on top. One idea would be we still declare the lowering rules via tensor intrinsics, but reuses the pattern matching techniques in this RFC to rewrite to hints that applies the tensor intrinsics. This way we can organically combine the two ideas together.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/541141436/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
