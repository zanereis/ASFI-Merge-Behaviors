I hope to improve this phenomenon. Can you provide the improvement brought by this PR? such as test results\r\n\r\n@guyinyou \r\nIMO, the current design is indeed close to bottleneck, but the processing of messages is always continuous, so it will tend to a steady state. The number of successfully written messages per second does not change much. Only the message sending rate is reduced. If there is no back pressure, there will still be lots of rejections.\r\nDue to limited testing equipment, I just ran a simple test on my laptop.\r\nI set the producer to 4 threads for continuous asynchronous message sending.\r\nAt the same time, I set up a thread to monitor the number of **_async-sent messages_**, the number of **_successfully sent messages_**, the number of **_timeouts messages_**, and the number of **_rejected messages_** within this 1s.\r\n\r\n* When **off enableBackpressureForAsyncMode**:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107378995/178930270-dab1e341-b38e-41d7-8a10-b73959c18ad4.png)\r\n\r\n* When **on enableBackpressureForAsyncMode**:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107378995/178930355-79705bc7-ae36-4ccc-8bac-b31533faecf9.png)\r\n\r\nAlthough the local test cannot completely simulate the heavy-traffic environment in the server, it can still be seen, that after turning on the backpressure, **the async-sending rate is reduced, but the rate of successful message writing remains unchanged. Besides, a large number of rejections can be avoided.**\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1184105162/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1184192989","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/4601#issuecomment-1184192989","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/4601","id":1184192989,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl85GlVnd","user":{"login":"guyinyou","id":36399867,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2Mzk5ODY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36399867?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyinyou","html_url":"https://github.com/guyinyou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyinyou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyinyou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyinyou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyinyou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyinyou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyinyou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyinyou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyinyou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyinyou/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-14T09:06:37Z","updated_at":"2022-07-14T09:06:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> \r\n\r\nThe effect is still very obvious, well done.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1184192989/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1184206529","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/4601#issuecomment-1184206529","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/4601","id":1184206529,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl85GlY7B","user":{"login":"guyinyou","id":36399867,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2Mzk5ODY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36399867?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyinyou","html_url":"https://github.com/guyinyou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyinyou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyinyou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyinyou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyinyou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyinyou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyinyou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyinyou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyinyou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyinyou/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-14T09:20:15Z","updated_at":"2022-07-14T09:20:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"When I benchmarked rocketmq before, there was a need for back pressure. My approach was to maintain a semaphore to control the concurrent number of asynchronous sending, which achieved a very ideal effect. You can try it.\r\n\r\n```\r\n UniformRateLimiter rateLimiter = new UniformRateLimiter(1024);\r\n AtomicLong windowsCnt = new AtomicLong(0);\r\n while(true) {\r\n    try {\r\n        if(Producer.windowsCnt.incrementAndGet() >= windowsSize){\r\n            while (Producer.windowsCnt.get() >= windowsSize) {\r\n                Thread.yield();\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        producer.send(new Message(xxxxxxx), new SendCallback() {\r\n            @Override public void onSuccess(SendResult sendResult) {\r\n                windowsCnt.decrementAndGet();\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            @Override public void onException(Throwable e) {\r\n                windowsCnt.decrementAndGet();\r\n                throw new RuntimeException(e);\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n    } catch (Exception e) {\r\n        e.printStackTrace();\r\n    }\r\n }\r\n```\r\nOf course, this implementation is very rough. In actual scenarios, this rateLimiter should be a dynamic value, which may be increased or decreased according to the number of failed messages sent recently, the delay in sending, etc. If you are interested, you can communicate and discuss together.
