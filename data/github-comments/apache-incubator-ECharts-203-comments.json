sorry for the late reply.\r\n\r\nI think it is not good enough solution to only labels are hidden but still keep ticks showing. The strategies of label and tick are so complicated that we'd better think this through before modifying it and make the logic neat as far as possible.\r\n\r\n> Support more powerful label strategy for \"time\" axis. For example, make it do better when showing labels of only day/week/month/year in proper positions (e.g. the first time tick of the duration) and without duplication.\r\n\r\nCurrently in `/src/scale/Time.js` the `niceTicks` only approximate interval by the `interval` settings.\r\nI think we might provide a new option (or enhance the existing options)  for users to specify a fixed `scaleLevel` and enable a callback to determine the `scaleLevel` directly by the current axis extent. But the format of the options I need to do some investigation. I will do it soon and give a proposal here.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/476825523/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/476920117","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/7234#issuecomment-476920117","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/7234","id":476920117,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NjkyMDExNw==","user":{"login":"whidy","id":2074757,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzQ3NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2074757?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/whidy","html_url":"https://github.com/whidy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whidy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whidy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whidy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whidy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whidy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whidy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whidy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whidy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whidy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-27T01:10:22Z","updated_at":"2019-03-27T01:36:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@zhangwang9li 想请教一下，那不挂载data上面，每个不同的组件都有echarts实例初始化，那切换路由的时候需要在组件destroy里面销毁吗，单页面应用会产生问题吗，\r\n还是说离开的时候自动被浏览器回收了，\r\n\r\n我后来试了一下，同一个带有图表的页面和另一个没有图表的页面切换多次后，内存会不断增加，可能造成的内存泄漏，应该是每次创建了一个闭包环境没有被销毁，就不断增加了。那这样的话不将echarts实例挂在data上面，就没办法销毁了吧。还是其他办法，我也看了[vue-echarts](https://github.com/ecomfe/vue-echarts/blob/master/src/components/ECharts.vue)似乎是挂在data上面。\r\n\r\n以及饿了么官方封装的[v-charts issues](https://github.com/ElemeFE/v-charts/issues/467)有人也问到同样的问题。\r\n\r\n内存泄露如下图：\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2074757/55043898-2d1f5500-5073-11e9-8bcb-fdb14113e9e2.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/476920117/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":3},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/476929530","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/10168#issuecomment-476929530","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/10168","id":476929530,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NjkyOTUzMA==","user":{"login":"echarts-bot[bot]","id":45089189,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDUwODkxODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/20872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/echarts-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-27T01:47:19Z","updated_at":"2019-03-27T01:47:19Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi!

It actually means the gap between the axis label and the axis line.\r\n\r\n[axisLabel.padding](https://ecomfe.github.io/echarts-doc/public/en/option.html#yAxis.axisLabel.padding) indeed only consider itself only without the neighboring elements. It is implemented the same as other labels follow the \"rich text\" module. \r\n\r\nECharts does not have an overall layout system as DOM did in Normal Flow, Floats, etc., which layout DOM elements by the margin/padding automatically without overlap. The layout strategies in echarts are case by case, meeting each chart/component requirements. That makes the code easy to implement but probably less customizable and intelligent. \r\n\r\nGo back to this issue. I think what we can do is:\r\n+ Enhance the axis label and tick layout strategy to avoid overlap and more customizable and meet some certain requirements (especially in time axis)\r\n+ Since the option [grid.containLabel](https://ecomfe.github.io/echarts-doc/public/en/option.html#grid.containLabel) already makes the grid auto located considering the axis label without overflow the edge of the echarts area, we probably also need to take axis name into account in this layout (current not consider axis name yet).\r\n+ For long axis name, indeed it needs a more intelligent auto adjustment when it will overflow the container.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/477199710/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/477203917","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/9942#issuecomment-477203917","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/9942","id":477203917,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NzIwMzkxNw==","user":{"login":"skiingyac","id":15035993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDM1OTkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15035993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/skiingyac","html_url":"https://github.com/skiingyac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skiingyac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skiingyac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skiingyac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skiingyac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skiingyac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skiingyac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skiingyac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skiingyac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skiingyac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-27T15:16:50Z","updated_at":"2019-03-27T15:16:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"node
