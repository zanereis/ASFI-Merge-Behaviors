So i agree on having better way of choosing default interpreter. \n\nThis branch let user set default interpreter name in 'interpreter' menu as a property value. However, i think it's not very natural, because\n- Choosing default interpreter 'group' is being done in interpreter binding menu and Choosing default 'interpreter' is being done in interpreter property setting menu. not very consistent.\n- Choosing default interpreter 'group' applied per notebook. but choosing default 'interpreter' applied per interpreter setting. it is also confusing.\n\nMy suggestion is let user drag and drop individual interpreters, in group, inside of interpreter binding menu.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1540981/9343320/18f0323c-45b6-11e5-9789-d09e642e3c11.png)\n\nSo user can set default interpreter 'group' and default 'interpreter' together in the same menu, and both applied per notebook. \n\nWhat do you think?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/132361024/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/132366509","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/225#issuecomment-132366509","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/225","id":132366509,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMjM2NjUwOQ==","user":{"login":"deepujain","id":406777,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNjc3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/406777?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepujain","html_url":"https://github.com/deepujain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepujain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepujain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepujain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepujain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepujain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepujain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepujain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepujain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepujain/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-18T21:49:22Z","updated_at":"2015-08-18T21:49:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"How

@randerzander i understand the benefits of unifying and abstracting common or related code but i fail to see how this jdbc interpreter helps with this? It still will be required to create a separate interpreter projects to cope different drivers specifics. \nIMO the main pain point at the moment is the lack of generic Dep insertion functionality. This project doesn't help with this. Also trying to unify the JDBC driver's URL notations (correct me if i've misunderstood) is contraproductive. Usually those are well known. By abstracting them you force the devs to learn not only the driver specific notation but also the abstraction and the way to get around it...\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/132526921/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/132559083","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/228#issuecomment-132559083","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/228","id":132559083,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMjU1OTA4Mw==","user":{"login":"djoelz","id":8881115,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODExMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8881115?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/djoelz","html_url":"https://github.com/djoelz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djoelz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djoelz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djoelz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djoelz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djoelz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djoelz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djoelz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djoelz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djoelz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-19T11:45:17Z","updated_at":"2015-08-19T11:45:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@akhiluanandh could you please add unit tests to your changes?

Implementing it per setting is straightforward, as we just need to bring the interpreter to the front of the group associated with that setting. From my understanding, it seems that making it per note would take significant changes in various parts of the codebase.\n\nImplementation side, agree, per setting is more straightforward.\nHowever, in ux side, i still think it's confusing to have \"default interpreter group\" per notebook, \"default interpreter in group\" per setting.
