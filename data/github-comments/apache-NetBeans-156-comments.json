The `index.html` was modified to read:\r\n```html\r\n<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n<!--\r\nClick nbfs://nbhost/SystemFileSystem/Templates/Licenses/license-default.txt to change this license\r\nClick nbfs://nbhost/SystemFileSystem/Templates/Other/html.html to edit this template\r\n-->\r\n<html>\r\n    <head>\r\n        <title>TODO supply a title</title>\r\n        <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\r\n        <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\r\n        <link href=\"primeflex.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" />\r\n    </head>\r\n    <body>\r\n        <div class=\"sm:align-content-between\">TODO write content</div>\r\n    </body>\r\n</html>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith that setup I see no errors:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2179736/225369400-90624d0d-c745-43e2-9df0-a53f9015b574.png)\r\n\r\nMy suspicion is, that the CSS file can't be directly resolved via the `link` tag. See this screenshot:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2179736/225370027-57ab004a-f57f-425e-9361-3eb732bc8c6c.png)\r\n\r\nThe first entries (dark-green) come from `primeflex.css` directly referenced (code is the same as shown above). The light-gray entry  `.sm:align-content-dummy` comes from a new file I created in the project, but did not reference. Using this class would be flagged.\r\n\r\nCould you provide the full project you used to test? Thank you!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1470325085/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1470355758","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/5620#issuecomment-1470355758","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5620","id":1470355758,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5Xo9ku","user":{"login":"neilcsmith-net","id":3975960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3975960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net","html_url":"https://github.com/neilcsmith-net","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-15T16:27:41Z","updated_at":"2023-03-15T16:27:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Yes, but I don't think that changes the argument.

If I uncheck on setting and $other setting is changed as a side effect and not automatically changed back, I as a user would be very surprised.\r\n\r\nTo turn off maven indexing, I have a single click, to return to the previous setting I have to do multiple clicks. Why?\r\n\r\n> I don't like it that the grayed out check box can be still shown as selected with this approach. I think this sends the wrong message through the UI.

While this PR demonstrates having such a **firm compiler specification** is possible, it is not the goal of this PR to make any such changes. My goal is to allow usage of `nb-javac` in the NetBeans build system and start testing such combo. Clearly there are issues in the `nb-javac` that shall be improved (for example the `-Werror` problem mentioned above). Improving them while having CI checks on NetBeans as well as `nb-javac` side is a solid engineering approach I am aiming at. \r\n\r\nHopefully the [three line change](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/5609/files#diff-2e6575e0d5f99cfd495a77cb8c35ab906d34f9dd2ea1aa9c93156a180a237ab3R132) to the regular build process is found safe enough to allow us to get it in and start evolving the NetBeans+nb-javac combo properly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1475294533/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1475295010","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/5609#issuecomment-1475295010","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5609","id":1475295010,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5X7zci","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-19T15:33:11Z","updated_at":"2023-03-19T15:34:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> One advantage of having a firm compiler during build is less dependence on specifics of the compile-time JDK.

Then I probably cannot do it, but this is not a technical problem.\r\n - I need to use JDK 17 to build NB from now, and everyone else has to.\r\n - (possibly some handwaving around eager modules, which may or may not desirable for a given module)\r\n\r\nThe second point makes it unclear to me how to finalize a change like this - while this should not affect people running the resulting build, it will affect everyone building it, and will require upgrade of the build JDK. How does one do that?\r\n\r\nShould we simply say that NB builds using the newest JDK only? (The newest JDK at the time of release, or something like this.) Because that's one of the very few alternatives I see for using newer sources?\r\n\r\n(Here I'd like to point out that build JDK is not necessarily the runtime JDK. And, with the changes in past years, I believe it should be easily achievable to have build JDK newer than the runtime JDK, and the opposite direction was always the case.)\r\n\r\n> \r\n> > Also, if we ever tried to make reproducible builds, having a firm, known, compiler might reduce the amount of problems to solve.\r\n> \r\n> It is trivial to install a JDK from a known vendor, if the javac is really the biggest problem.

it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1475834539/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1475867535","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/5260#issuecomment-1475867535","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5260","id":1475867535,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5X9_OP","user":{"login":"mbien","id":114367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien","html_url":"https://github.com/mbien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-20T09:12:20Z","updated_at":"2023-03-20T09:12:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@neilcsmith-net
