Yes, exactly, but it looks like TVM doesn't support it, does it?\r\n\r\nI'm thinking of a temporary workaround by adding appending all the constraints and axis dependencies as well as a function to verify a config's validity to the ConfigEntity class. Every time when a tuner's `next_batch` function is called, it calls the validation function and only takes those configs that are valid. I think directly making changes on the ConfigEntity class itself to only keep the valid configs might mess up the stuff.\r\n\r\nWould love to hear your

On the other hand, the runtime validation sounds not a general solution, because it might affect the tuner. For example, throwing invalid configs in `next_batch` would result in no measurement results for those records, which means the learning based tuner won't get the feedback of invalid configs. I would prefer either of the following:\r\n\r\n1. Propose a new config space representation to support non-grid config space.\r\n2. Let verify passes pluggable. Currently, we have `VerifyGPU` pass that traverses TIR to estimate the memory usage and rejects invalid configs before sending them for compilation. Since this is at the evaluation stage, the rejected configs will still appear at the log file with proper error code, so that the tuner can benefit from it. We can make this mechanism as a callback so that users can bring their own verifier. The problem is that the verifier does not have config space information but just a graph in TIR, so it might be more difficult to check if it's valid or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/650312544/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/650343229","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/5910#issuecomment-650343229","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5910","id":650343229,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1MDM0MzIyOQ==","user":{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-26T18:57:43Z","updated_at":"2020-06-26T18:57:43Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Just FYI, if you want to run CI locally, you may find the commands in Jenkins helpful.

One could make a case that the current parser is suboptimal, because ANTLR does a sort of \"covering parse\", and [_parser.py](https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/blob/master/python/tvm/relay/_parser.py) then does **another** stage of parsing that incorporates context, but I would argue there's value in this separation of concerns, because you no longer need to worry about the syntactic components of parsing (e.g., [precedence and associativity](https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/pull/5932/files#diff-807cc0a7f01f9113c1903d4614a3649dR749-R769)).\r\n\r\nAnother benefit of using a parser generator like ANTLR is that you have a [specification](https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/blob/master/python/tvm/relay/grammar/Relay.g4) of the language that serves as documentation **and** defines the parsing behavior, keeping the documentation always up to date.\r\n\r\nI see the value in error reporting integration and removing the external dependency, but it would be good to further motivate these changes and maybe find ways to further modularize version 2.0 to make it noob-friendly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/650369009/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/650393102","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/5936#issuecomment-650393102","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5936","id":650393102,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1MDM5MzEwMg==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-26T20:46:24Z","updated_at":"2020-06-26T20:46:24Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Please

@comaniac Thanks for the comments! The feedback of the invalid configs is something I didn't think of. Actually this is the representation I came up for non-grid config space. If the config space is too large, and there are too many constraints so that the shape of the space is very irregular, it will cost too much memory to store the whole config space during the runtime. Therefore I'm thinking of storing a grid space with the current representation and its constraints as the solution. I wonder if it is possible to throw the error code in `next_batch`? Or the error code can only be thrown by a low-level check?\r\n\r\nThe second plan sounds like an interesting idea. Is it gonna be a new pass as you suggest? My concern is as Ansor comes out the pass might not be of great use in the future.
