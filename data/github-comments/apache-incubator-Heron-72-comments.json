Now that Heron is part of the Apache Foundation we need to go through a different release process as well as host the convenience binaries on Apache infrastructure for distribution. We are close to getting to that point, but still have a little bit of work to do. If you want to build the install script for a platform you can run the following command\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> $ bazel build --config=darwn/ubuntu/centos/debian scripts/packages:binpkgs\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> However, instead of having `darwn/ubuntu/centos/debian` as the config parameter value you need to select one OS value.\r\n> \r\n> MacOs would be `--config=darwin`\r\n> Debian would be `--config=debian`\r\n> Ubuntu would be `--config=ubuntu`\r\n> Centos would be `--config=centos`\r\n> \r\n> The output will be a file named `heron-install.sh` if I remember correctly.\r\n\r\nI have some comping errors #3463  , so I have to install the newest version using this way.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/589496427/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/589500778","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/3382#issuecomment-589500778","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/3382","id":589500778,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4OTUwMDc3OA==","user":{"login":"nicknezis","id":181930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTkzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/181930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis","html_url":"https://github.com/nicknezis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-21T05:08:00Z","updated_at":"2020-02-21T05:08:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Can this Pull Request be closed due to the work done by @thinker0 in #3399 and #3434 ?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/589500778/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/589752566","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/issues/3468#issuecomment-589752566","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/3468","id":589752566,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4OTc1MjU2Ng==","user":{"login":"nwangtw","id":6353055,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNTMwNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6353055?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwangtw","html_url":"https://github.com/nwangtw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwangtw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwangtw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwangtw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwangtw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwangtw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwangtw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwangtw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwangtw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwangtw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-21T17:27:06Z","updated_at":"2020-02-21T17:27:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yeah.
