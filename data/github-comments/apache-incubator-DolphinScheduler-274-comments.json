> What about using `TestNG`?\r\n> \r\n> This may need to refactor all test code, if we want to use `TestNG` to replace Junit\r\n\r\n@ruanwenjun  Yes. At this moment, I think we have about 4 people, me and my colleagues who will work on the UT refactoring. It is possible for us to refactor all test code and fix all related style / formatting issues. The question lying between choosing `TestNG` and `jUnit` is whether it is necessary to replace one with another.
