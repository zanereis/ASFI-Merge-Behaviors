While the rate is much (much) smaller than earlier versions it still means that the application will crash, possibly after a week rather than a few minutes, but that's still not acceptable in a 24/7/365 production environment.\r\n\r\nI'm not completely sure that there is a leak.  After running for about 20 hours the trend of the memory footprint for the tab running the chart code in Chromium is generally upwards.  It started with a footprint oscillating around 100k and is now oscillating around about 200k.  I didn't initially take note of the GPU memory usage, but that also seems to be trending upwards.\r\n\r\nWhile the snapshots seem to show a small (1.5MB) increase I can't definitively assign this to the application  - I just started running the chart in an existing browser instance so it's possible JavaScript on other pages is contributing to this.  I think that Chromium uses only one JS engine instance, but I'm not sure - I'm not an expert there.  I'm also not enough of a JavaScript expert to confidently interpret the contents of the snapshot.\r\n\r\nThere's definitely been some good progress, but given the critical nature of memory leaks I would appreciate is someone else could replicate and determine whether there is still a slow leak.\r\n\r\nI cannot detect any issues with the application in #10130 but that's a much smaller, less demanding application - it would take longer to demonstrate a problem.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/572296291/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/572336651","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/11999#issuecomment-572336651","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/11999","id":572336651,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MjMzNjY1MQ==","user":{"login":"echarts-bot[bot]","id":45089189,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDUwODkxODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/20872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/echarts-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-09T01:21:56Z","updated_at":"2020-01-09T01:21:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This
