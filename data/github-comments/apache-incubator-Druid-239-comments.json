I'm asking because there are a lot of things this template asks for that we do not currently always ask for on every PR.\r\n\r\nI think I added enough language to make everything optional. However, the expectation is that regular developers will do most of the things (which they often don't do now). So yes, this is an elevation of the standards.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that we think that doing these things is beneficial for the common productivity (when a PR author who is a regular contributor considers not only their own productivity right during the preparation of the given PR, but also productivity of the reviewers, and productivity of dozens of people who will work with their code later over the lifetime of the project). So we *want* to do these things rather than consider them as chores. The template is a memo for ourselves to not forget about them.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/492234068/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/492240945","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/6702#issuecomment-492240945","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6702","id":492240945,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MjI0MDk0NQ==","user":{"login":"leventov","id":609240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwOTI0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/609240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov","html_url":"https://github.com/leventov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-14T13:37:55Z","updated_at":"2019-05-14T13:37:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The inspections build is failing with an \"unresolved Javadoc reference\" error which is now fixed in IntelliJ 2018, but we cannot upgrade to it because of persisting problems (see #7589).

I have just created a new PR #7676 in order to continue discussion about the new type of Incremental Index based on Oak concurrent navigable map.\r\n\r\nFor those yet not familiar with Oak - it is an off-heap (direct-allocation) concurrent navigable (ordered) KV-map. More details about Oak can be found in the previous comments in this issue and in PR #7676 introduction.\r\n\r\nFor those who are familiar with Oak, this is what have been done so far (since this project went on a pause):\r\n1. The Druid's integration was reconsidered and renewed to impose less changes in Druid. (The old refactoring schema doesn't imply any longer.) The Oak integration code is rebased on the up-to-date Druid's code.\r\n2. Oak is now E2E connected and Druid cluster based on OakIncrementalIndex can be created. Details how to activate in PR #7676.\r\n\r\nThe Oak isolated benchmarks can be found here (in order to see the potential in using Oak vs ConcurrentSkipListMap): [OAK PERFORMANCE.pdf](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/files/3188690/OAK.PERFORMANCE.pdf)\r\nWe will soon publish OakIncrementalIndex JMH benchmarks available in Druid. However, those benchmarks are single threaded and we might need some modifications in order to show Oak benefits well.\r\n\r\nPlease take a look on PR #7676 and raise your questions here or there. Clearly we have more work to do, this is just a start! :) We will join the Druid developer sync meeting next Tuesday, May 21, to discuss the Oak possibility further.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/493201879/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/493216517","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/7675#issuecomment-493216517","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7675","id":493216517,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MzIxNjUxNw==","user":{"login":"fjy","id":428325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODMyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy","html_url":"https://github.com/fjy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-16T20:17:17Z","updated_at":"2019-05-16T20:17:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jihoonson can we backport this?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/493216517/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/493217120","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/7675#issuecomment-493217120","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7675","id":493217120,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MzIxNzEyMA==","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-16T20:19:14Z","updated_at":"2019-05-16T20:19:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Doc changes don't have to be backported.
