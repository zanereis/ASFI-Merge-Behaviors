I think it's necessary to create a new module for each large version of kafka, but if we create a separate module for each sub version of kafka, it does seem a bit more. But we did use some kafka non-public APIs, and I don't know if they have the possibility to be modified in the sub version. If you don't add a separate module for the sub version, you will only be able to use branch decisions like if/else in the future.\r\n\r\nAre you working in the same place with @aljoscha ?

Keep in mind that Kafka client's version that we are using is independent of Kafka server's that we are talking to. For example our Kafka 0.11.3 connector as far as I know is able to work with both Kafka 1.0 and 1.1 (with lower performance however).\r\n\r\nHowever, I thought a little bit more about arguments for providing separate module for each major Kafka version and there is one huge argument in favour of that: bug fixes in Kafka. There are quite a lot of bugs in Kafka and sometimes they are not backported to older versions. I think this reason is good enough for adding `flink-connector-kafka-1.1` module, even if our code is almost identical. Also this would reduce our user's confusion \"Does flink-connector-kafka-0.11 works with Kafka 1.0?\".\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/414964833/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/414967223","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6577#issuecomment-414967223","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6577","id":414967223,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNDk2NzIyMw==","user":{"login":"yanghua","id":2283778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODM3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2283778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua","html_url":"https://github.com/yanghua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-22T09:13:51Z","updated_at":"2018-08-22T09:13:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@pnowojski Agree, then I will first refactor the duplicate code based on 1.0, then add the 1.1 module.

I'm asking because I have mixed feelings with this:\r\n\r\n1. as it is, it brakes standard, which is bad\r\n2. adding configuration option `shouldConvertRaggedUnionTypesToVarying`, which by default would be `true` is equally bad\r\n3. making it by default `false` leaves us with an option that's very hard to explain to the users what does it to. I would guess almost nobody would use it\r\n4. having more configuration rises the complexity of the system - more features that we need to maintain, support, refactor, test etc. This can quickly become a nightmare.\r\n5. it seems like very cosmetic change. In most cases it doesn't matter, since either the result is being printed or being stored in an external system that has it's own schema. As long as in this external system column is defined as `VARCHAR(x)` this issue doesn't matter. Isn't the scope of this limited purely to unit tests, where we need to compare to spaces?\r\n6. if we agree to introduce this change, should we also agree when next time someone reports that he/she would like to have things like:\r\n\r\n- `123.456` literal being double or decimal?\r\n- `'abc'` literal being `CHAR(3)` or `VARCHAR(3)`?\r\n- `'A  ' || 'B  '` returning `'AB'` or `'A  B  '`?\r\n- 'NULL == 0` being true, false or null?\r\n- `SUBSTRING('abc' FROM -2 FOR 4)` should yield 'a' or 'bc'?\r\n\r\nand the list goes on and on. We definitely can not provide a switch for all of such quirks. Having one switch like `mysql-compatibility-mode: true` would have more sense, however it's impossible to implement/maintain for different reasons.\r\n\r\nThat's why I don't like changing the default behaviour and I see more problems then positives by introducing this as a configurable option. \r\n\r\nHowever I see one issue here that would solve this problem. Since Flink does not support `CHAR(x)` anywhere besides string literals, and our `CHAR(x)` support seems to be broken (for example `'A  ' || 'B  '` should return `'A  B  '`), maybe we should treat all string literals as varchars?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/415699060/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/415706823","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6610#issuecomment-415706823","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6610","id":415706823,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNTcwNjgyMw==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-24T09:33:14Z","updated_at":"2018-08-24T09:33:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Good catch!\r\n\r\nCould you undo the changes to `LatencyMarker`?

There are many cases need this feature. Not only `case when`, but also `nvl`, `greatest` and `least`.  Most users encounter the blank problem is `case when`. Examples have been added in the test cases. Below I will add some more examples:\r\n1. \r\n```\r\nSELECT country_name\r\nFROM (\r\n\tSELECT CASE id\r\n\t\t\tWHEN 1 THEN 'GERMANY'\r\n\t\t\tWHEN 2 THEN 'CANADA'\r\n\t\t\tELSE 'INVALID COUNTRY ID'\r\n\t\tEND AS country_name\r\n\tFROM country_id\r\n)\r\nWHERE country_name = 'GERMANY'\r\n```\r\nThis sql will output nothing since the blank problem. It is very confused.\r\n\r\n2. \r\n```\r\nSELECT country_name, country_info \r\nFROM (\r\n\tSELECT CASE id\r\n\t\t\tWHEN 1 THEN 'GERMANY'\r\n\t\t\tWHEN 2 THEN 'CANADA'\r\n\t\t\tELSE 'INVALID COUNTRY ID'\r\n\t\tEND AS country_name\r\n\tFROM country_id\r\n) nameTable join infoTable on nameTable.country_name = infoTable.country_name;\r\n```\r\nThis sql cannot join correctly since the blank problem. 'GERMANY' in nameTable becomes 'GERMANY-----------'.  BTW, '-' means the blank.\r\n\r\nIt is true the sql standard returns CHAR type, but nearly all major DBMSs return VARCHAR without blank-padded.

Thanks for pointing it out and giving a detailed explanation. It should be a comparison problem for CHAR/VARCHAR. We probably should implement support for `CHAR` as you said,  making trailing spaces insignificant in comparisons. \r\nI think this pr tries to solve the output problem. Once we solve the comparison problem, we still have to solve the output problem. Output `case when` results to a nonbinary strings field in storages. Some storages treat CHAR/VARCHAR with trailing spaces equally('a' equals to 'a '), like mysql, so no problems here. Others don't, for example, kafka or elasticsearch. So, I think we should not add trailing spaces in result of `case when`, just like most DBMSs do.\r\nWhat do you think?\r\nThanks again.

Unfortunately, divisions (modulo) are even more expensive, so would be good to avoid them.\r\n\r\nI think the solution can be actually a bit simpler. It would probably be sufficient to simply initialize the array to `INT_MAX - 1` replace the `this.returnArray[0] = 0;` in the original code with `this.returnArray[0] = resetValue()`. Inside the `resetValue()` you can do the initialization.\r\n\r\nThat way, common cases have no additional check, and the overflow/reset case gets one additional branch, which is already a good improvement.\r\n\r\nWe could possibly do a followup optimization, where outputs that have only one channel swap in a special selector that always returns just `0`. The one-channel-only case is probably the one that would be affected most by this change, because it always overflows each time.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/416043267/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/416095640","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6448#issuecomment-416095640","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6448","id":416095640,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNjA5NTY0MA==","user":{"login":"yanghua","id":2283778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODM3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2283778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua","html_url":"https://github.com/yanghua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-27T02:17:22Z","updated_at":"2018-08-27T02:17:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@juhoautio Yes, you are right, agree!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/416095640/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/416097515","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6578#issuecomment-416097515","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6578","id":416097515,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNjA5NzUxNQ==","user":{"login":"jerryjzhang","id":3949293,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDkyOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3949293?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryjzhang","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryjzhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryjzhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryjzhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryjzhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryjzhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryjzhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryjzhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryjzhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryjzhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryjzhang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-27T02:32:09Z","updated_at":"2018-08-27T02:32:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@twalthr could you review this again?

This PR also do not fix your original issue - broken `CHAR(x)` support in Flink.\r\n\r\nOutput column type of `CHAR(x)` should be properly handled by each connector. For example if Flink is processing some `CHAR(X)` column which is then being written to some sink/connector, it's this Sink's responsibility to correctly handle padding - whether that means trimming it or not depends on the underlying column's type. Again, changing type of `case when` only partially hides the problem.\r\n\r\n>  I think we should not add trailing spaces in result of case when, just like most DBMSs do.\r\n\r\nBelow examples are incorrect. Please check my next message. \r\n\r\n~Further more, please correct me if I'm wrong, but this sentence seems not quite correct:~\r\n\r\n~MySQL~ http://sqlfiddle.com/#!9/ce6d86/1 \r\n\r\n1. ~string literals seems to be of `VARCHAR(x)` type.~\r\n2. ~`CONCAT` on `CHAR(x)` is broken~\r\n3. ~indeed `case when` returns `VARCHAR(x)`~\r\n\r\n~Oracle~ http://sqlfiddle.com/#!4/ce6d86/1\r\n\r\n1. ~string literals seems to be `VARCHAR`~\r\n2. ~type of `case when` calculated dynamically, depending which branch was selected, but looks like `CHAR(x)`~\r\n\r\n~PostgreSQL~\r\nhttp://sqlfiddle.com/#!17/ce6d8/1\r\nhttp://sqlfiddle.com/#!17/c6522/1/0\r\n\r\n1. ~again, string literals are of `UNKNOWN` type~\r\n2. ~`case when` return type is `CHARACTER`.~\r\n\r\n~MSSQL~ http://sqlfiddle.com/#!18/ce6d8/2\r\n\r\n1. ~again, string literals seems to be `VARCHAR`~\r\n2. ~oO... I'm not even attempting to interpret those results... probably `concat` on `VARCHAR` with trailing spaces is seriously broken~\r\n\r\nBtw, if you look at those results, you should understand why I'm objecting into providing a configuration switch (or more like a hundred of them) in order to follow what \"other DBMSs do\". This is simply impossible...\r\n\r\nAlso as I wrote previously. The proper fix for the problem would be to either fix `CHAR(x)` support or to change string literals' type to `VARCHAR(x)`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/416196736/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/416202178","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6606#issuecomment-416202178","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6606","id":416202178,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNjIwMjE3OA==","user":{"login":"twalthr","id":5746567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDY1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5746567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr","html_url":"https://github.com/twalthr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-27T11:53:48Z","updated_at":"2018-08-27T11:53:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you @fhueske for you feedback.

Check out those examples:\r\n\r\nPostgreSQL\r\nhttp://sqlfiddle.com/#!17/c6522/1\r\n\r\n- string literals are of `UNKNOWN` type, that behaves like `VARCHAR`\r\n- `case when` on `CHAR` arguments returns `CHAR` type.\r\n\r\nMSSQL:\r\nhttp://sqlfiddle.com/#!18/50a92/1/0\r\n(click `browser` schema button and explore `types_test` view)\r\n\r\n- string literals are `VARCHAR`\r\n- `case when` return type strictly follows the standard - `CHAR(8)`\r\n\r\nOracle:\r\nhttp://sqlfiddle.com/#!4/50a92/1/0\r\n(click `browser` schema button and explore `types_test` view)\r\n\r\n- string literals are `CHAR`\r\n- `case when` return type `VARCHAR`\r\n\r\nThis is still hardly conclusive to motivate the change for me.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure why are you rejecting my proposal to change default string literal type to `VARCHAR`. It would fix all of our `CHAR` problems (comparisons, connector support, functions support, etc)  for now and `case when` would return `VARCHAR` automatically. Even if in the future we would want to provide a configuration switch `string-literals-type: char/varchar`, such configuration option would be cleaner and much easier to understand compared to `shouldConvertRaggedUnionTypesToVarying`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/416559091/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/416589910","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6621#issuecomment-416589910","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6621","id":416589910,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNjU4OTkxMA==","user":{"login":"twalthr","id":5746567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDY1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5746567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr","html_url":"https://github.com/twalthr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-28T13:46:09Z","updated_at":"2018-08-28T13:46:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you @fhueske.

I am not sure we can do it.\r\nAnd Calcite provides a simple way to override shouldConvertRaggedUnionTypesToVarying to solve the problem.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/416603955/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/416625728","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6624#issuecomment-416625728","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6624","id":416625728,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNjYyNTcyOA==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-28T15:14:33Z","updated_at":"2018-08-28T15:14:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1, this was bothering me the whole time ;-)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/416625728/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/416629286","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6417#issuecomment-416629286","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6417","id":416629286,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNjYyOTI4Ng==","user":{"login":"zhijiangW","id":12387855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzg3ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12387855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW","html_url":"https://github.com/zhijiangW","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-28T15:24:23Z","updated_at":"2018-08-28T15:24:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for your reviews @NicoK \r\n\r\nSorry for the late updates with this PR because I am a little busy recently, also regarding with the benchmark results.\r\n\r\nFor my own broadcast benchmark, this changes gain obvious improvement. But for non-broadcast cases, the throughput of `StreamNetworkThroughputBenchmarkExecutor` seems a bit decreased than before. After I adjusted to keep the same process of `pruneBuffer()` as before, the results seem a bit better than current, but still has a bit decrease (1% sometimes) than before. So I guess another reason is in the past the `RecordSerializer` will maintain the `BufferBuilder` internally and keep copying multi serialization results until full. But now for each record we have to get the `BufferBuilder` from the arrays in `RecordWriter` then pass it to the `RecordSerializer`. And this is the key difference and overhead because the `RecordSerializer` is stateless. So I am still trying to improve other parts to compensate this loss.\r\n\r\nI am trying to update this PR soon based on all the above comments!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/416629286/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/416647706","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6519#issuecomment-416647706","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6519","id":416647706,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNjY0NzcwNg==","user":{"login":"pnowojski","id":8957547,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NTc1NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8957547?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski","html_url":"https://github.com/pnowojski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-28T16:15:07Z","updated_at":"2018-08-28T20:12:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Good point with the comparisons. I meant that after changing literal types to `VARCHAR` (and accepting that this brakes SQL standard) our comparisons/functions (like `concat`) would be more SQL standard compliant, without the need to fix them. Saying that our literals are `VARCHAR` and we are being consistent with handling them is better then providing broken `CHAR`. Also it should be a cheaper and way easier for us compared to finding all places that do not handle `CHAR` as they should and fixing them. As a side note, I generally consider `CHAR` as a pretty useless type, especially since unicode it's no longer fixed length.\r\n\r\nChanging type of string literal would be easy in calcite (`org.apache.calcite.rex.RexBuilder#makePreciseStringLiteral`).\r\n\r\nOn our side it's might a little bit be more tricky. I might be wrong here, but it might be enough to provide `RexShuttle` that do `CHAR` to `VARCHAR` type rewrite and apply it to `org.apache.calcite.rel.AbstractRelNode#accept(org.apache.calcite.rex.RexShuttle)` as a yet another \"zero\" step. Which also doesn't sound overly complicated.\r\n\r\n`shouldConvertRaggedUnionTypesToVarying` both with better `CHAR` support or `VARCHAR` literals looses it's purpose (and becomes cosmetic change), or doesn't it?\r\n\r\nSince I consider this our `CHAR` handling to be a serious problem, I would like it to be fixed (in one way or the other) before 1.7.0 release. If we could fix this properly, would you be fine with proper fix superseding this PR? If we would be running out of time, we could reevaluate this closer to feature freeze.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/416647706/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/416655819","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6492#issuecomment-416655819","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6492","id":416655819,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNjY1NTgxOQ==","user":{"login":"bowenli86","id":1892692,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTI2OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1892692?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bowenli86","html_url":"https://github.com/bowenli86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bowenli86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bowenli86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bowenli86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bowenli86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bowenli86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bowenli86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bowenli86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bowenli86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bowenli86/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-28T16:38:45Z","updated_at":"2018-08-28T16:38:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@kl0u ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/416655819/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/416702085","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6483#issuecomment-416702085","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6483","id":416702085,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNjcwMjA4NQ==","user":{"login":"HuangZhenQiu","id":1072199,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzIxOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1072199?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HuangZhenQiu","html_url":"https://github.com/HuangZhenQiu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HuangZhenQiu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HuangZhenQiu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HuangZhenQiu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HuangZhenQiu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HuangZhenQiu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HuangZhenQiu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HuangZhenQiu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HuangZhenQiu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HuangZhenQiu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-28T18:58:24Z","updated_at":"2018-08-28T18:58:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@docete @fhueske \r\nTo make a clean interface for filterable parquet input format, I needs add lots of code in this PR.
