Having to remember module names and the : in the right place was a major pain. Now it's super convenient to start typing the module name and use auto-complete. It goes down to individual tests.\r\n\r\nI also renamed and shortened the run_unit_test.sh method to simple 'run-test' that you can run anywhere (it is in the path). I also added --skip-db-init flag - most of the tests do not require to re-run the database initialisation and if you want to re-run single test, it takes awfully lot of time. So you can now pass --skip-db-init flag to skip resetdb/initdb. You can even autocomplete it ;). \r\n\r\nI think with those changes, life of developers trying to use breeze/replicate CI tests will be much, much easier.\r\n\r\nI used nosetests for now but we can do very similar thing with pytest when we switch to it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/476195528/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/476196640","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1910#issuecomment-476196640","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1910","id":476196640,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NjE5NjY0MA==","user":{"login":"RosterIn","id":48057736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MDU3NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48057736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RosterIn","html_url":"https://github.com/RosterIn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RosterIn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RosterIn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RosterIn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RosterIn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RosterIn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RosterIn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RosterIn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RosterIn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RosterIn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-25T13:28:59Z","updated_at":"2019-03-25T13:28:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I wondered why this view doesn't refresh automatically.
