The issue is on the usability of pulsar-client. This is a nice simple useful tool but the fact that it is not capable of cleaning up after itself is very odd to me.\r\nI think the main use of this tool is for testing producing and consuming to a topic:\r\n\r\n1. Produce:\r\n `pulsar-client produce -m HiThere persistent://a/b/c `\r\n2. Consume:\r\n `pulsar-client consume -s s1 persistent://a/b/c`\r\n `pulsar-admin topics unsubscribe -s s1 persistent://a/b/c`\r\n\r\nWhy is use case 2 a two-step process and why is a second tool required to clean up?  I would suggest that the default behaviour be that the subscription does not persist but at the very least there should be a `-u`, `--unsubscribe` option so that the use of pulsar-admin is not required after **every** use of `pulsar-client consume`. \r\n\r\nOf course, setting up a subscription is also a valid use case but I would think it's probably much less common than the above.\r\n\r\nAnd sure, it's possible to do the job with the existing tools, it's just inconvenient and non-intuitive - the issue was put in as a feature request not a bug.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/665295087/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/665302195","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/6709#issuecomment-665302195","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/6709","id":665302195,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2NTMwMjE5NQ==","user":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-28T21:51:45Z","updated_at":"2020-07-28T21:51:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@sbourkeostk I was under the impression that you are suggesting introducing a \"unsubscribe\" command in pulsar-client CLI. \r\n\r\nIn my previous comment, I am fine with adding an option to `pulsar-client consume`.
