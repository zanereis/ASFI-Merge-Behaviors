TLDR: push new commits onto your github branch.\n1. The code review\n   REEF follows a review-then-commit (RTC) model. We perform all our code reviews on GitHub: Community members will leave comments on your pull request and suggest changes. You can have a look at prior pull requests to get an idea of what to expect. During this process, you may want to change your code. You can do that by pushing additional commits to your branch. Don't worry about squashing the commits into one at this stage. This will be done by the committer once your code is merged into REEF.\n\nWhen the code review concludes, one of Committers will merge your work into the REEF codebase.
