I recalled that you\nhave included that change that delete app creation, can you check if that\nchange is still in?( Sorry I don’t have access to my laptop or I’ll check\nmyself).\n\nTao Feng

For instance the clock snippet/clock.js is basically unchanged.\r\n\r\nA couple of advantages of doing that. \r\n- We'd be able combine our javascript and all the dependencies (like d3.js, nvd3.js) in one single minified chunk, which would be efficient and improve the page load time. \r\n- Write the test cases of our JS code by using separate files. \r\n\r\n> Secondly: with this change does it mean we can't just checkout the repo and run the (RBAC) webserver? (I'm not sure if that's a problem per se, I just want to check)\r\n\r\nAs a contributor, if you want to contribute in the repo, you'll need to compile the javascript at least once, using `npm run build` and it will remain in your `static/dist/`. I've also added the details in Contributing guidelines on how to build the JS code. But it would be great to rebuild everytime you pull the lates code from master branch, just to make sure you are completely synced with all the new libraries/packages.\r\n(If you'll make changes in javascript then for every change you'll need to recompile javascript, or use `npm run dev` to automatically compile JS on every change).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/403521579/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/403528762","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3584#issuecomment-403528762","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3584","id":403528762,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMzUyODc2Mg==","user":{"login":"jmeickle","id":536435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmeickle","html_url":"https://github.com/jmeickle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmeickle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmeickle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmeickle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmeickle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmeickle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmeickle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmeickle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmeickle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmeickle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-09T15:56:29Z","updated_at":"2018-07-09T15:56:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"n.b. this one still needs work, as I am having significant difficulty completely running Airflow's test suite, even in a container.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/403528762/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/403542798","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3583#issuecomment-403542798","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3583","id":403542798,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMzU0Mjc5OA==","user":{"login":"neil90","id":9617778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTc3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9617778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neil90","html_url":"https://github.com/neil90","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neil90/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neil90/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neil90/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neil90/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neil90/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neil90/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neil90/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neil90/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neil90/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-09T16:41:58Z","updated_at":"2018-07-09T16:41:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Fokko, So this is using the base Python3 Docker image.
