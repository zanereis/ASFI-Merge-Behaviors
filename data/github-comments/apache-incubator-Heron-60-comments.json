SummingBird for instance has internal threads that do all kind of processing. The only thing that they have to do is to do their acks/fails in the same thread as process thread. Thus in the present scenario imagine this situation\r\n1. User Bolt has two 'worker' threads that actually do some work and use some kind of queue to put their acks/fails in the main process thread.\r\n2. tupleA, tupleB, ckptTuple, tupleC is the order as seen by the system\r\n3. say tupleA is handled by threadA and tupleB is handled by threadB.\r\n4. process thread receives ckptTuple. It calls preSave, followed by state collection. If the user's dont carefully program their preSave, we wont have guarantee that users will record tupleA and tupleB's execution state. \r\n5. When things go bad and state is rewinded, ckpt is restored at the bolt level  and system continues from tupleC.\r\nNote that in this case, because users are doing out of band/out of order processing, tupleA and tupleB are not acked/failed before ckpt is handled. Thus it is left to the preSave functionality for them to save their state properly.\r\nNow whether the acks/fails are done using some kind of sync between user thread and worker threads or in the worker threads themselves has no bearing upon this state of affairs.

Admittedly, merging this pull request will not break the single-thread case, but this new pull request claims some interfaces thread-safe. So it sounds like a queue implementation has only: 1. thread-safe `push()` without thread-safe `pop()` 2. will still work in the single-thread case, and it claims itself a thread-safe concurrent queue.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand:\r\none thing I mentioned above is:\r\n```\r\nif (spout instanceof IStatefulComponent) {\r\n      ((IStatefulComponent) spout).preSave(checkpointId);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    collector.sendOutState(instanceState, checkpointId);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAbove block should be executed atomically. So we would need to make sure the state is flushed out before any furthermore processing. And currently based on this implementation, it seems **no way** to guarantee that inside the topology if users do emit in multi-threads. So users will **no way** to implement a correct effective-once topology with the support of thread-safety in this pull request.\r\n\r\nAn example is: an instance completes a checkpoint, but some later tuples are processed and emitted in another thread - users have **no way** to guarantee the checkpoint is flushed before the flush of later processed data tuples' emits, since this execution is out of the scope of the topology.
