I can always squash everything together into a single commit when it comes time to merge.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/316241277/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/316244018","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3552#issuecomment-316244018","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3552","id":316244018,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNjI0NDAxOA==","user":{"login":"mingmxu","id":2017944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTc5NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2017944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingmxu","html_url":"https://github.com/mingmxu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingmxu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingmxu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingmxu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingmxu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingmxu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingmxu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingmxu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingmxu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingmxu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-19T01:16:52Z","updated_at":"2017-07-19T01:16:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"sure.

I'm concerned about a few things:\r\n1) This introduces *a lot* of complexity into the hottest codepath in TextIO, finding the next separator. What previously was a loop comparing each `char` to `\\n` or `\\r`, now for each `char` loops over a set of separators and loops over each separator in the set. It seems likely to be a big performance regression - would you mind e.g. comparing how long it takes to sequentially read 1GB from a local file by manually using the `TextSource` class, say, in a unit test, before and after this change?\r\n2) I'm also concerned about the complexity from the point of view of error-proneness. That codepath is already very hard to understand (I would hope that there is a way to make it simpler, but I've taken stabs at it before and failed), and I think this change pushes it well into nightmare territory.\r\n3) The abstraction of having a set of separators and splitting by the longest one seems unnecessarily generic to me - I have a hard time imagining a text-based file format that requires such an abstraction to parse. Do you have use cases where you actually use a nontrivial set of separators, that is neither simply `{\\r, \\n, \\r\\n}`, nor a single marker string such as `--- next record ---` or something?\r\n\r\nLet's discuss these and see if there's a reasonable API to ship with Beam here. E.g. I think, in addition to what TextIO currently does, it definitely makes sense to support reading whole files (no separator) and support reading multiline blocks of text separated by a marker line.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/316285536/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/316287291","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3569#issuecomment-316287291","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3569","id":316287291,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNjI4NzI5MQ==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-19T06:38:17Z","updated_at":"2017-07-19T06:38:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\n[![Coverage

Thank you for your helpful feedback!\r\n\r\nI agree that this PR probably over-generalizes and thus introduces more complexity and error-proneness than necessary, at least for a Beam API item with so much traffic.\r\n\r\nThis one generalization could be broken into three realistic tasks we'd like to do:\r\n\r\n1. Append a single custom delimiter string to the default list of delimiters, `{\\r, \\n, \\r\\n}`.\r\n2. Use a custom delimiter without using the default list of delimiters.\r\n3. Have no delimiters, thereby reading a whole file as one.\r\n\r\nTask 1 can be accomplished similarly to this current PR, except rather than replacing the original default delimiter logic with a double-nested for-loop, we would append a only a single loop immediately after the default delimiter logic that checks for the one provided custom delimiter if it exists. This single loop would look similar to the inner loop of my PR's logic. The custom delimiter would be passed through `withCustomDelimiter()` or such.\r\n\r\nTask 2 can be achieved by adding a `withDefaultDelimiters()` option (similar to `withCompressionType()` or my `withDelimiters()`) that may be set to false. The original default delimiter logic will be wrapped in a simple conditional statement. If `withDefaultDelimiters()` is false, the default delimiters won't be applied. Otherwise, they will be applied exactly as in the original logic.\r\n\r\nTask 3 can be achieved two ways:\r\n\r\n1. Implement Task 2. Thus, to read a whole file, a user simply disables the default delimiters and the whole file gets read. Potentially, a convenience option like `wholeFile()` could select `withDefaultDelimiters(false)` for a user.\r\n2. Create an alternative path through TextIO (or a different thing like \"FileIO\" or such) that ignores all searches for delimiters. This has the potential to be faster when reading the whole contents of a large file because it wouldn't have to call `findSeparatorBounds()` in TextSource.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow does this sound? Especially with Task 3, I'm not certain which way would be more Beamish. I appeal to you for that insight. It's possible that even my PR's logic would be reasonable if brought out into a separate Class, but that would duplicate a lot of functionality.\r\n\r\nI'd be glad to dev these out if they sound reasonable. In the meantime, I may do some performance tests like you mentioned in your list item 1.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/316415105/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/316440124","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3581#issuecomment-316440124","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3581","id":316440124,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNjQ0MDEyNA==","user":{"login":"aaltay","id":696638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NjYzOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/696638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay","html_url":"https://github.com/aaltay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-19T16:21:00Z","updated_at":"2017-07-19T16:21:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"cc: @chamikaramj ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/316440124/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/316456936","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3521#issuecomment-316456936","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3521","id":316456936,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNjQ1NjkzNg==","user":{"login":"flaviocf","id":8687583,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2ODc1ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8687583?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/flaviocf","html_url":"https://github.com/flaviocf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flaviocf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flaviocf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flaviocf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flaviocf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flaviocf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flaviocf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flaviocf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flaviocf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flaviocf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-19T17:20:34Z","updated_at":"2017-07-19T17:20:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Addressed comments, above failing check seems unrelated to this change.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/316456936/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/316468217","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3595#issuecomment-316468217","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3595","id":316468217,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNjQ2ODIxNw==","user":{"login":"aaltay","id":696638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NjYzOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/696638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay","html_url":"https://github.com/aaltay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-19T18:01:02Z","updated_at":"2017-07-19T18:01:02Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"LGTM.
