By making `WritableResourceHandler` extend `ResourceHandler` (parallel to `WritableMemory` extend `Memory`) it fixed the overloading problem.  \r\n\r\nI have removed all the prefixes of writable except for one:  writableRegion(offset, capacity).  This method works off of an instance instead of the class.   The call is  `myMem.writableRegion(...)`, so there is no repetition.  \r\n\r\nWe could also make this a static method and then the calls would be `WritableMemory.region(WritableMemory mem, long offset, long capacity)` and `Memory.region(Memory mem, long offset, long capacity)`.  Then there would be no \"writable\" prefixes on method names.  \r\n\r\nThis way of creating a region would then be virtually the same as if you just passed (Memory, offset, capacity) to a client, and let them do their own positioning. The latter does not create a new object but the client has a view of the total parent capacity.  The former creates a new object wrapper, but limits the client to what they can see.  There are use cases for both.\r\n\r\nI do prefer accessing the Writable \"constructor-type\" methods from the WritableMemory class.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/286263963/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/286265935","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/4045#issuecomment-286265935","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4045","id":286265935,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NjI2NTkzNQ==","user":{"login":"leventov","id":609240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwOTI0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/609240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov","html_url":"https://github.com/leventov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-13T22:39:01Z","updated_at":"2017-03-13T22:39:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"In

original use case is like this:\r\nI cached the DImensionSelector, and then go through the cursor. When cursor comes to the new data, the cursor.isDone() returns false, then I use the cached DImensionSelector to getRow().get(0) -- I know I have a dimension which contains only 1 not-null value, so I can call get(0) without any check, and then \"Index (0) is greater than or equal to list size (0)\" exception is raised.\r\nI finally identify that it is due to the id>=maxId logic.\r\n\r\nI think if

Broadcasting data is an extreme case of replication, and I think it will be used only for join. So, if load rules are used for broadcasting data, they are used for two different goals, retaining data and preparing data for join.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this, @gianm proposed a new rule called ```DistributionRule```. This new rule controls the data distribution by specifying like \"these two tables should be stored together\". In this case, a smaller one is broadcasted to all nodes holding the segments of the larger one. Also, this rule can be extended to include partitions like \"these two tables should be stored together by partition on a key\". This rule can be applied to only partitioned data sources on the same key. It means, the distribution of a data source can be changed by applying DistributionRule, but its configuration which is specified at ingestion time (like partitionSpec) cannot be changed. \r\n\r\nI think this will be valueable because it is less confused than using load rules and extensible for partitions. @weijietong, I also think you can use this feature later.

For example, ValueMatchers can use it to build a set of ids matching a predicate before scanning, and then use that set during the scan for filtering (instead of actually applying the predicate to each row). TopN can use it to pre-allocate storage for each possible dimension value. Filtered DimensionSpecs can use it to build an id mapping ahead of time. If DimensionSelector `getRow()` could return ids beyond what `getValueCardinality()` returns when the selector is first created, then applying these optimizations could lead to incorrect results.\r\n\r\nOf course, the current solution to that problem (pretending the values are null) isn't perfect either: it leads to the issue you're facing now, where nulls show up in unexpected places.\r\n\r\nOne way to solve both problems is to return `CARDINALITY_UNKNOWN` from `getValueCardinality()` of StringDimensionIndexer's DimensionSelector and also remove the maxId limit. This would tell callers that the dictionary isn't known ahead of time and disable the above optimizations. I'm not sure if this would be worth the performance hit or not.\r\n\r\nAnother is on the query end: if you add a filter like the following to your query, then (after the patch from this PR is applied) you won't get unexpected nulls in `myDim`.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"not\",\r\n  \"field\": {\r\n    \"type\": \"selector\",\r\n    \"dimension\": \"myDim\",\r\n    \"value\": \"\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother option is to change the contract of DimensionSelector such that `getRow()` _can_ return values outside `getValueCardinality()`, and it's up to the caller to decide what it wants to do. Perhaps topN and groupBy would decide to skip over such values and not include them in the results.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/286779784/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/286780759","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/4060#issuecomment-286780759","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4060","id":286780759,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4Njc4MDc1OQ==","user":{"login":"drcrallen","id":8213081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMTMwODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8213081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen","html_url":"https://github.com/drcrallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-15T15:35:36Z","updated_at":"2017-03-15T15:35:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Since this should fix 2 bugs 0.10.0 seems like a reasonable place","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/286780759/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/286781469","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/4052#issuecomment-286781469","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4052","id":286781469,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4Njc4MTQ2OQ==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-15T15:37:51Z","updated_at":"2017-03-15T15:37:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@leventov I'll look at both of those.\r\n\r\nOther than fixing bugs with the behavior under the current contract, does anyone have any opinions on other options from my previous comment?

I think `DistributionRule` is a good concept to express the data distribution to the users. \r\n\r\nAs mentioned above ,to distribute the partitioned data, I defined four relevant metadata tables which is similar to implement the `DistributionRule`. A bucket is a group of segments which have partitioned by the same dimension key. The  metadata table `table_group` specify which tables will apply the following distribution strategy. When ingesting the data,we have the bucket number and the relevant segment relationship. This metadata stores in the `bucket_segment` metadata table.I define another common distribution interface called `IPartition` which do the work to distribute the bucket number to a server that also means find the sever to load the relevant segments. I have implemented several different consistent hash implications of that interface to be candidate. Also that interface has the responsibility to do the replication work. I use the double ring with replicator factor to guarantee replicated segments stored at different servers. The distribution result of this interface will be stored in the metadata table `bucket_assignment` . I reuse the `LoadRule` to do the real work to load segments according to the distribution result of last step. Another reason to store `bucket_assignment` is to compare the old / new distribution results to choose the segments to be moved due to the cluster has changed and the users decide to do so.\r\n\r\nI think this is a implementation of the `DistributionRule` concept . To broadcast table ,the bucket equals to the small table and another `IPartition` implementation to assign this small table to all the servers which service the biggest table.

disabled, and enabling it requires setting a specific cache type) so imo, what this issue should be about is:\r\n\r\n- Move caffeine-cache from an extension to core\r\n- Update the example cache configs (where most users get their first cache configs from) to use `caffeine` instead of `local`\r\n- Update other caching related docs, and release notes, to push people towards choosing `caffeine` over `local`\r\n- Possibly deprecate `local`\r\n\r\nAn alternative interpretation is we should merge `local` with `caffeine` so they both do the same thing, but I don't think we should do this right now, in part because the configs are different and so it wouldn't be a fully compatible change with folks' existing configs. imo, it would make sense to do that in the next major release when `local`

removed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/287089661/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/287092682","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/4067#issuecomment-287092682","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4067","id":287092682,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NzA5MjY4Mg==","user":{"login":"drcrallen","id":8213081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMTMwODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8213081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen","html_url":"https://github.com/drcrallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-16T15:25:06Z","updated_at":"2017-03-16T15:25:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"To
