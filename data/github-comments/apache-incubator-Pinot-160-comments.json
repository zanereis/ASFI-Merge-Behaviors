We can improve the rebalance behavior when we have the clear idea if we really need to configure tiers without COMPLETED tenant.\r\n\r\nI didn't know there is need to configure a COMPLETED tenant. I see tenants are usually named like DefaultTenant_OFFLINE or DefaultTenant_REALTIME for different table types, as well as in the local test I did. Is the `DefaultTenant_REALTIME` used as CONSUMING and COMPLETED tenants for RT table by default? Feel free to point me to docs about those if any.\r\n\r\n> 2.

One of the reason I asked is when you break things, it is hard to identify where it breaks. (like the linked list issue you mentioned). It is hard to notice an array changes to a link list in the review as well.. \r\nAnyway, I am happy the issues gets resolved. I'll try my best to review the current PR as it is.

AFAIK, all commits will be squash to a single commit and thus can guarantee that make the commit history linear when the PR got merged. If so, shall we use `git merge` when pull the remote master change? Otherwise, I need to force overriding every time push after `git rebase`. @jadami10

This sends 3 requests in parallel for every table (get table size, ideal state, and external view). This likely overwhelms the browser for a bit, and it makes it so even if you click into a table while it's loading, it still has to wait for all of those requests to finish. We could probably load 10 or so tables at a time and use cancellation tokens when you navigate away from the page.\r\n\r\nI'm not really a fan of adding another button to load more data. That feels like it's degrading the user experience when we could probably just request data more slowly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1317180424/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1317204756","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/9710#issuecomment-1317204756","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/9710","id":1317204756,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5OgvMU","user":{"login":"jadami10","id":4760722,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NjA3MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4760722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadami10","html_url":"https://github.com/jadami10","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadami10/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadami10/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadami10/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadami10/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadami10/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadami10/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadami10/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadami10/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadami10/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-16T15:30:51Z","updated_at":"2022-11-16T15:30:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> A newbie question, the [guide](https://docs.pinot.apache.org/developers/developers-and-contributors/contribution-guidelines#creating-a-pull-request-pr) recommend to use git rebase. AFAIK, all commits will be squash to a single commit and thus can guarantee that make the commit history linear when the PR got merged. If so, shall we use git merge when pull the remote master change? Otherwise, I need to force overriding every time push after git rebase. @jadami10\r\n\r\nWith github, I generally use `git merge` when updating PRs because it keeps the change history. When you rebase/force push, the reviewer loses the \"see changes since your last review\" button. It's not a big deal, just a quality of life change.\r\n\r\nIf you've ever used something like phabricator, it does a better job of decoupling changes from their actual commits, so even if someone rebases/force pushes, it can show you just the changes that user made.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1317204756/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1317273862","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/9781#issuecomment-1317273862","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/9781","id":1317273862,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5OhAEG","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-16T16:14:34Z","updated_at":"2022-11-16T16:14:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/9781?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) Report\n> Merging [#9781](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/9781?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (01b889d) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/commit/47c8f184365d6ffde870f94285747b9e009c7c15?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (47c8f18) will **increase** coverage by `8.17%`.\n> The diff coverage is `86.45%`.\n\n```diff\n@@             Coverage Diff              @@\n##             master    #9781      +/-   ##\n============================================\n+ Coverage     60.58%   68.75%   +8.17%     \n+ Complexity     5281     4999     -282     \n============================================\n  Files          1949     1963      +14     \n  Lines        104632   105028     +396     \n  Branches      15847    15895      +48     \n============================================\n+ Hits          63389    72214    +8825     \n+ Misses        36540    27762    -8778     \n- Partials       4703     5052     +349     \n```\n\n| Flag | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| integration2 | `24.39% <0.00%> (-0.05%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| unittests1 | `67.89% <86.45%> (+0.07%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| unittests2 | `15.77% <86.45%> (?)` | |\n\nFlags with carried forward coverage won't be shown.
