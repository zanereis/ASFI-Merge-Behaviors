Mainly because of this:\r\nhttps://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-config/issues/1645\r\n\r\nIn summary, this is because attribute resolution registered by Syncope is only conditionally activated via:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@ConditionalOnProperty(\"cas.authn.attribute-repository.syncope.url\")\r\npublic class SyncopePersonDirectoryConfiguration { }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis means, when you start up empty, the configuration class and all the other beans in it will get ignored and skipped. Then, when you refresh by adding a value (such as URL), Spring application context will fail to refresh beans, because there is nothing to refresh to begin with. Refresh requests and scope only work in scenarios in the application context hierarchy where there is a reference to a bean that can be refreshed; beans or configuration classes that were skipped during the startup and application context initialization will never be refreshable, because they are not re-created. IOW, refresh requests only work best when there is a setting whose existing value changes from A to B; if there was no A to begin with, or if A is being removed, refresh requests may fall short. \r\n\r\nSo it's very difficult to: keep things refreshable, and, make sure the context is not polluted with *noise* (i.e. beans that exists and do nothing).\r\n\r\nFor now, we might have to accept noise; that is to remove `@ConditionalOnProperty(\"cas.authn.attribute-repository.syncope.url\")` and let the context create empty beans, only to be refreshed later. This might be a good compromise for now in the 6.5.1 line.\r\n\r\nThis is being worked on in 6.6 so that conditional beans on props continue to work correctly, though as you can imagine, this goes quite deep and will take a bit of time to get right. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/syncope/issues/comments/1040075316/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/syncope/issues/comments/1040113493","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/syncope/pull/315#issuecomment-1040113493","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/syncope/issues/315","id":1040113493,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAYb9hs49_t9V","user":{"login":"ilgrosso","id":1064664,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjQ2NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1064664?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilgrosso","html_url":"https://github.com/ilgrosso","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilgrosso/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilgrosso/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilgrosso/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilgrosso/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilgrosso/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilgrosso/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilgrosso/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilgrosso/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilgrosso/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-15T10:35:51Z","updated_at":"2022-02-15T10:35:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Ok, your explanation makes definitely sense to me.\r\n\r\nSo, we should consider (and maybe document) as manageable by `WAConfigService` not all the available CAS properties, but only the ones that are not used to define conditions on Spring beans; those ones shall be instead placed in some `wa-*.properties` file.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/syncope/issues/comments/1040113493/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/syncope/issues/comments/1040273540","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/syncope/pull/315#issuecomment-1040273540","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/syncope/issues/315","id":1040273540,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAYb9hs4-AVCE","user":{"login":"mmoayyed","id":1205228,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDUyMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1205228?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmoayyed","html_url":"https://github.com/mmoayyed","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmoayyed/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmoayyed/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmoayyed/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmoayyed/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmoayyed/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmoayyed/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmoayyed/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmoayyed/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmoayyed/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-15T13:28:11Z","updated_at":"2022-02-15T13:28:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yes I agree.

don't think downgrading is a good or practical option. First, it's possible that we might break someone else, and also something in CAS UI that might depend on this, but the bigger concern is that downgrading is only a stop-gap that sooner or later would break. The strategy should be that if a CAS module decides to switch a dependency, and for whatever reason SB does not, then we ought to be able to receive that update immediately and easily without a lot of gymnastics. This quickly becomes important when security patches to external libs that might affect CAS but not SB would be needed.\r\n\r\nShort of declaring a dependency on the dialect, (or even declaring an override version), both of which I think are uncomfortable, I would think this should be the more ideal solution which would be putting this into wa or wa/starter:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<dependencyManagement>\r\n    <dependencies>\r\n      <dependency>\r\n        <groupId>org.apereo.cas</groupId>\r\n        <artifactId>cas-server-support-bom</artifactId>\r\n        <version>${cas.version}</version>\r\n        <type>pom</type>\r\n        <scope>import</scope>\r\n      </dependency>\r\n    </dependencies>\r\n  </dependencyManagement>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe should let CAS manage CAS, and then we only override what we want, and only when we want it. Not because we have to. \r\n\r\nAs for the 401 vs 500 error, I don't think you're missing anything. The scenario is that generally, the external provider returns back a 401, and CAS translates that, *correctly* I think into a 401. One could debate whether the end result should be a 401 or 500, and In my opinion, 500 makes more sense, though I don't recall if this was ever an intentional change. That said, as far as the particular test here goes, it should be safe to assume that the response status returned from the test is either a 4xx or a 5xx. Both should be appropriate. You should care about the fact that the operation failed in the general sense.

The error code the provider returns is entirely separate from how CAS wants to process that error code; maybe it's the same, maybe it's different, maybe it's ignored. In other words, this is not a \"behavior\" or a feature; you're testing something that uncharted, accidental, undocumented, and could change at any moment. What the test should care about is that something, (at least for now), went wrong. The specific error code is not a contract or a standard feature in any way, and if your test passed in 6.5, it was only because you were lucky.
