@jhuynh1 ,\r\n\r\nThanks for the feedback.\r\n> Is there a test that makes sure we didn't change observable behavior from the client? Meaning, is there a test that makes sure size returns the same value before and after this change?\r\n\r\nThere isn't a test for this right now but I don't think is necessary to add one, basically because the `ClientServerSessionCache.size()` method is just a wrapper for `Region.sizeOnServer()`, which is already tested in several parts of the product. The old behaviour did exactly the same but with more boilerplate, so no changes to what the user sees. I can add an extra test for this if you want,

@jinmeiliao, in logging method(_IntegratedSecurityService.java_) it remove ThreadContext so new Thread will be added for other user. \r\nThe problem is in logout. At the start it trying to catch subject from currentThread and it is a wrong behavior. Method logout is called every time when it get **JMXConnectionNotification.CLOSED** and it doesn't know what connection is closed and catch current thread and logout user from it. If we logout that user, and after that received one more **JMXConnectionNotification.CLOSED**  it will try again logout user from current thread which is now null. \r\nWith this solution, when connection is closed it will send which user is disconnected and on which thread it is, so logout method will not get it from current thread as it will have this information and know what user from which thread it need to logout.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/507535387/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/507793749","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/3769#issuecomment-507793749","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/3769","id":507793749,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNzc5Mzc0OQ==","user":{"login":"moleske","id":12620096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIwMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12620096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/moleske","html_url":"https://github.com/moleske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moleske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moleske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moleske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moleske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moleske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moleske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moleske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moleske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moleske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-02T18:28:31Z","updated_at":"2019-07-02T18:28:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I don't think so, but I'm willing to defer if the community has more thoughts than I.

It's still very much a work-in-progress, but you can check out an early draft of our code (with bugs) in #3799 (you can view it there even if we close the draft PR). We found a [great YouTube video by Angelika Langer that includes some great coverage on CompletableFuture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_0_1mKTlnY) that I recommend checking out.\r\n\r\nEdit: CompletableFuture is basically used to represent async operations. It implements both the Future and CompletionStage interfaces. It provides ways to aggregate multiple async operations (multiple CompletableFutures) as one CompletableFuture. It also provides ways to submit Runnables that will fire when the async operation completes.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about cancel or why you need to prevent it. I guess if you evaluate CompletableFuture and determine it won't work because of how or if it supports cancellation, then I'll ultimately approve not using it. I would think that Cache close or JVM shutdown would require cancellation support. Or you could maybe subclass CompletableFuture to override the cancel methods.\r\n\r\nEdit: Good articles with better info on CompleteableFutures than I can write:\r\n- [Write Clean Asynchronous Code With CompletableFuture Java-8](https://nirajsonawane.github.io/2019/01/27/Write-Clean-asynchronous-code-with-CompletableFuture-Java-8/)\r\n- [Java 8: Definitive guide to CompletableFuture](https://www.nurkiewicz.com/2013/05/java-8-definitive-guide-to.html)\r\n- [Java 8: Writing asynchronous code with CompletableFuture](https://www.deadcoderising.com/java8-writing-asynchronous-code-with-completablefuture/)\r\n- [Guide To CompletableFuture](https://www.baeldung.com/java-completablefuture)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/511487353/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/511492635","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/3801#issuecomment-511492635","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/3801","id":511492635,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMTQ5MjYzNQ==","user":{"login":"demery-pivotal","id":45369324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzY5MzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45369324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/demery-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-15T17:22:13Z","updated_at":"2019-07-15T17:22:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> We discussed using the Future interface…\r\nDo you mean that you discussed using `CompletableFuture`?\r\n\r\n> … and were concerned about its \"cancel\" method.

Would you recommend that in that case we implement cancel to throw an unsupported op exception?\r\n\r\nThe `cancel()` method is a bit of a wart in `CompletableFuture`, which has the method only because it inherits it from `Future`. As the `CompletableFuture` javadoc says: \"Method `cancel` has the same effect as `completeExceptionally(new CancellationException())`.\" That is, it marks the `CompletableFuture` as completed with a cancellation exception, and does nothing else.

Unless there is a non-stats use for this counter then it should just be kept by stats/meters and not yet another thing.\r\n\r\nHere's our thinking:\r\n- Micrometer gauges do not accumulate values. They only fetch values from some source.\r\n- We didn't want to invent a new meter type for this use case… yet. We may revisit this decision in the future as we get more experience linking Geode gauges to Micrometer gauges. (If we did create a new \"cumulative gauge\" meter type, that would also be \"yet another thing.\")\r\n- Currently Geode accumulates these increments and decrements only in stats. There is no other available source for this accumulated value.\r\n- We didn't want to configure the meter to fetch from the stat, because that would increase our dependence on stats. Given that we want to deprecate/remove stats eventually, we would eventually have to create some non-stat place to accumulate the increments and decrements. We chose to do that work now instead of deferring it until later.\r\n- So we added a new field to accumulate the increments and decrements, and configured the meter and the stat to get their values from that.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/514300619/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/514308076","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/3825#issuecomment-514308076","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/3825","id":514308076,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNDMwODA3Ng==","user":{"login":"aaronlindsey","id":1781978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODE5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1781978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlindsey","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronlindsey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlindsey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlindsey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlindsey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlindsey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlindsey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlindsey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlindsey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlindsey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlindsey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-23T17:31:09Z","updated_at":"2019-07-23T17:31:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This was also done in PR #3824, see https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/3824/files#diff-ac14f73a76d33d5c50aca5669b4bbed6","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/514308076/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
