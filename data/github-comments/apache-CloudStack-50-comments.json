We are doing few very small cleans and changes in ACS code to teach some coding skills to some interns. Thus, we found pretty bothering to code sometimes, we were coding you start to write “log” and hit ctrl+space bar and nothing showed up, the same happens in classes that use the “_” to start variable names. We know that s_something is an ACS standard for static variables, but we thought that the name logger would be better. \n\nThat was a pretty interesting proposal, because we could get to know a little better the ACS code, and found some others small things we could change to make the coding more pleasant. For instance, we are planning a PR removing the “@Local” from all classes of ComponenteLifeCycleBase, hence they all are either spring beans or manually instantiated.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/140491359/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/140493836","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/778#issuecomment-140493836","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/778","id":140493836,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MDQ5MzgzNg==","user":{"login":"miguelaferreira","id":4670993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NzA5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4670993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira","html_url":"https://github.com/miguelaferreira","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-15T18:38:50Z","updated_at":"2015-09-15T18:39:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I do agree that prepending \"s_\" to static variables is a waste of characters. Modern IDEs will signal static variables for you. It's a bit like prepending (or appending) type information in the variable name. There was a time it was useful, but that time is long gone.\n\nI also appreciate abstraction in code, that is, you've now introduced a protected variable in a base class that will be available to all the classes that extend it. However I do not see a real benefit in adding this particular indirection level. I mean, loggers are very straight forward to add and understand, so standardising on how they are declared and used seems to me far better than having it be a static variable in some classes, and a non-static-protected-inherited variable in others.\n\nThere is plenty I would like see done in terms of cleaning the code of ACS. For instance I've measured duplicate code a year ago and found 25% of the code to be redundant. \n(http://www.slideshare.net/miguel_f/20141121-cccenoanimations)\n\nThe DB layer is another example. ACS is at the moment using a deprecated library for it's DB layer, while there are other libraries (e.g. spring-data) that would actually generate most of the hand-made code we have now.\nI'll be very happy to share my thoughts with you about potential refactorings that would benefit the ACS code.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/140493836/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/140501928","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/833#issuecomment-140501928","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/833","id":140501928,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MDUwMTkyOA==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-15T18:59:43Z","updated_at":"2015-09-15T18:59:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[cloudstack-pull-analysis

Being pragmatic: the PR is huge, lacks unit/integration tests and did not even compile. We are all here to help and understand how to get all software/system engineers to commit code that keeps us, at least, in the same quality level we have now: not decreasing our already poor coverage.\n\nConcerning your environment: nice you have 4.3.2 in production and test. However, if you are changing master - 4k lines - it would be extremely nice to have a test environment  to cover your changes. If building a new test environment would cost too much time, you could at least have something like:\n- 1 VM with mysql and the source code\n- Build your branch on that VM\n- run the integration tests - with the simulator, at least\n- if all goes fine, create the PR\n\ncomponent/test_routers.py\ncomponent/test_vpc_routers.py\ncomponent/test_vpc_vm_life_cycle.py\nsmoke/test_vm_life_cycle.py\n\nAll instructions about how to run tests and the simulator can be found here: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/Validating+check-ins+for+your+local+changes%2C+using+Simulator\n\nIf you want to build a DevCloud environment and use it to execute more advanced integration tests against, please check here: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/DevCloud\n\nWe are here to help.\n\nCheers,\nWilder\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/140645340/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/140645427","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/714#issuecomment-140645427","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/714","id":140645427,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MDY0NTQyNw==","user":{"login":"wilderrodrigues","id":5129209,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMjkyMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5129209?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues","html_url":"https://github.com/wilderrodrigues","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-16T06:41:30Z","updated_at":"2015-09-16T06:41:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I will add the same comment to the opened PR instead.

@wilderrodrigues, As I said I get your point and the moment that you guys are on closing a version. \n\nA mistake was made, the moment I noticed that I jumped in and checked the problem and tried to fix it with this PR. No need to cut someone’s head with adamantium claws.\n\nSure the task was huge, but simple. That was the point on giving it to a less experienced student. I want them to see that even in huge systems like CloudStack and others; there are codes that are not pretty and shiny.\n\nThe improvement factor depends on the concept you use, removing few lines of code and using a more intuitive and standard name for a variable in a hierarchic of classes can be considered an improvement.  The same occur if we remove the @Local annotation of that hierarchic, the task will affect 600+ classes, but it is a simple one.\n\nSince you said that there is no way this PR will get accepted, I am closing it.\nThanks for your time.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/140729409/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/140729493","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/843#issuecomment-140729493","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/843","id":140729493,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MDcyOTQ5Mw==","user":{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-16T12:38:29Z","updated_at":"2015-09-16T12:38:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Also,
