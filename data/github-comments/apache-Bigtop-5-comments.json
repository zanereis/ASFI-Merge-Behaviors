In that scenario, the single `hadoop-client` would be a recognizable endpoint to facilitate hdfs administration, versus making users do that on a random spark unit.\r\n\r\nThat said, I'm coming around to your proposal to remove `hadoop-client`. Hulk smashing apps on a single unit has never been recommended and is only done to balance app density with resource cost.  As you already know, `spark` *is* a `hadoop-client` from the charms perspective, so an additional explicit client isn't needed.\r\n\r\nI'm +1 to this removal if you'll also pull out the Client-related statements from the bundle README.md.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/comments/375967887/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/comments/376746345","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bigtop/pull/200#issuecomment-376746345","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/200","id":376746345,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3Njc0NjM0NQ==","user":{"login":"JunHe77","id":17865359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODY1MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17865359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunHe77","html_url":"https://github.com/JunHe77","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunHe77/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunHe77/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunHe77/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunHe77/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunHe77/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunHe77/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunHe77/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunHe77/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunHe77/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-28T03:09:32Z","updated_at":"2018-03-28T03:09:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@guyuqi, could you pls rebase the patch as it has conflicts with HEAD and re-submit?

for reporting this issue, @deart2k !\r\nThe previous implementation assumes that only one minor version is listed in the url, say, only one 3.5.x. But it is obviously not true, as there are 3.5.3 and 3.5.4 on the link now. 😀 \r\n\r\nYour patch LGTM, while I think there might be a little to add: it may not true to assume the last `<li>` is the latest version. So an extra cmd can be added to make sure the output is ordered by version, like following:\r\n`curl --stderr /dev/null 'https://www.apache.org/dist/maven/maven-3/?F=0&V=1' | grep -o '<li>.*href=\"3.5.[0-9]*/\"' | grep -o '3.5.[0-9]*' | sort -V --field-separator=- | tail -1 | tr -d '\\n'`\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\nAnd could you pls create a JIRA to link with this PR so we can track this, just like https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BIGTOP-3031.\r\n\r\nThank you very much.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/comments/400149078/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/comments/400240168","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bigtop/pull/369#issuecomment-400240168","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/369","id":400240168,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMDI0MDE2OA==","user":{"login":"acmnu","id":10516877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTE2ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10516877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmnu","html_url":"https://github.com/acmnu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmnu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmnu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmnu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmnu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmnu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmnu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmnu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmnu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmnu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-26T09:17:50Z","updated_at":"2018-06-26T09:19:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@JunHe77, list is already sorted on server side (V=1 in GET parameters).
