Shows that dev envs tend to not be very representative of prod. Gunicorn 19.9.0 has a serious regression that makes it not work for SSL terminated LBs. There has been a github issue collecting cherries for a 19.9.1 since April ( https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/issues/2022 ), but unfortunately that release is still pending. However, there seems to be renewed momentum ( https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/pull/2114 ), so perhaps this will be resolved soon.
