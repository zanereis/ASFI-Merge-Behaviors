chaps, I've just opened [https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NUTCH-2102] which has a patch creating a WARCExporter based on MapReduce whereas the CCDD is a local file, single JVM sort of thing. As explained there, we will have a WARCImporter later on, which is outside the scope of the CCDD anyway + strictly speaking WARC is not specific to CommonCrawl so the package name I used in NUTCH-2102 is probably more appropriate.\n\nThat patch contains the changes to HttpResponse.java that we have here, whichever approach gets committed first - if any - means that we'd need to modify the other but no big deal.\n\nPersonally I'd have no problem in having some duplication of functionality between NUTCH-2012 and this improvement to the CCDD (we've done a lot worse over the years).

They already have some code for it, sure, but I'd rather they used and contributed to stuff which is in our codebase\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/comments/141483867/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/comments/141522061","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nutch/pull/55#issuecomment-141522061","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/55","id":141522061,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MTUyMjA2MQ==","user":{"login":"jorgelbg","id":1291846,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTE4NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1291846?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgelbg","html_url":"https://github.com/jorgelbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgelbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgelbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgelbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgelbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgelbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgelbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgelbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgelbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgelbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-18T18:07:26Z","updated_at":"2015-09-18T19:25:32Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Actually I think that @jnioche has a point, in terms of scalability NUTCH-2102 has a better approach.

I think we may have missed a few points when we were talking about this previously. All the Driver creation, clean up, and content pulling are done in lib-selenium so we can use that functionality across plugins. I think we can add this functionality without many (or any) changes though.\n\nIf you want to to do multiple content extractions and include that with the body, the handler can do that by incrementally pulling content out of the page and appending (or replacing) the body of the fetched page. This effectively allows the handler to return whatever subset of data that it wants and it doesn't require us to make any changes. I think that's probably a reasonably clean way of handling the

@asitang,\n\nIf I'm remembering correctly we were talking about wanting to pull content out of various parts of the page and append that to the body in the same interaction correct? So in psudocode:\n\n```\npublic void processDriver(WebDriver driver) {\n  String stuffWeCareAbout = \"\"\n  for allInteractionsWeNeedToDo {\n    driver.doInteraction()\n    stuffWeCareAbout += fetchHTMLFromTheInteractionWeDid()\n  }\n  driver.appendToBody(stuffWeCareAbout)\n}\n```\n\nWouldn't this cover the use case we were looking to handle sufficiently? Or in other words, if we want to do a bunch of interactions that generate content on a page the workflow per-interaction is:\n- Do the interaction on the driver\n- Grab the content this generates that we care about and save it into a variable\n- Undo the interaction if necessary\n\nOnce all the interactions we care about are done, we append this content to the body (or completely replace the body even).\n\n## \n\nSo imagine an example of a paginated table that dynamically loads content. This should handle what we're looking for I think (again, pseudocode)\n\n```\npublic void processDriver(WebDriver driver) {\n  String paginatedTableContent = \"\"\n  for tableInteractions {\n    if (! onFirstTablePage)\n      driver.clickPaginationButton()\n\n    paginatedTableContent += driver.table.innerHTML\n  }\n  driver.appendToBody(stuffWeCareAbout)\n}\n```\n\nNow when we process all the links coming out of this page they'll all be coming off the page with the table.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/comments/142714023/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/comments/142767299","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nutch/pull/63#issuecomment-142767299","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/63","id":142767299,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0Mjc2NzI5OQ==","user":{"login":"lewismc","id":1165719,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjU3MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1165719?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc","html_url":"https://github.com/lewismc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-24T00:22:33Z","updated_at":"2015-09-24T00:22:33Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thank you @zhangmianhongni for this patch.
