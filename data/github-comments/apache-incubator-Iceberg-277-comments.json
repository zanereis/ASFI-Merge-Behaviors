The metadata specification is closely related (identical as long as you specify an explicit CRS) to GeoParquet's metadata and it defines Arrow extension types/memory layout conventions for WKT, WKB, Point, Linestring, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLinestring, and MultiPolygon. The next release of the GeoParquet specification will probably include one or more of these as options because the Point/Linestring/Polygon/MultiPoint/MultiLinestring/MultiPolygon types have a storage type that encodes coordinates in Parquet such that bounding boxes are written as column statistics out-of-the-box by most Parquet writers.\r\n\r\nAt heart, GeoParquet is a file-level specification, whereas GeoArrow is a column-level specification. I wonder if there would be lower barrier to entry if the first step were to add GeoArrow types (maybe WKB to start) as a first-class type? MultiPoint, MultiLinestring, and MultiPolygon types would also give you bounding box information via the built-in system for nested column statistics (but are more complicated...nested lists of structs).

Internally, for models with merge strategie, dbt creates a temporary view with the data that has to merge in the destination table. We recently discover that if insteed of a temprary view, we materialize the new data as a table and then we run the merge, we save the CastException and the merge directive run OK. That seems to be a workaround and not the final solution to this issue. We are actually running spark 3.3.2, iceberg 1.3.0 and hive 2.3.9 as metastore.\r\nHope this help to solve the case.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1710250429/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1710293072","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/8333#issuecomment-1710293072","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/8333","id":1710293072,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85l8QBQ","user":{"login":"ext-diego-duenas","id":138730653,"node_id":"U_kgDOCETcnQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/138730653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ext-diego-duenas","html_url":"https://github.com/ext-diego-duenas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ext-diego-duenas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ext-diego-duenas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ext-diego-duenas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ext-diego-duenas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ext-diego-duenas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ext-diego-duenas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ext-diego-duenas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ext-diego-duenas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ext-diego-duenas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-07T14:50:46Z","updated_at":"2023-09-07T14:50:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Just to add to the Thread, we made a test changing all data types to String in the table with structs data type, and the error persist, so we don't think the error is related with the schema.

I think we need to get some feedback from  the Apache Iceberg team. Apache Iceberg is based on storage backends (which can be custom), such as Parquet, Avro, Orc (https://iceberg.apache.org/spec/#appendix-a-format-specific-requirements) - there can be also custom ones. Parquet is though the most popular one.\r\n\r\nUsing Geoarrow can make sense here, because all geodata would be stored the same way in all formats. Of course it would then not be 100% compatible with Geoparquet.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think the benefit of having this harmonized across all storage backends would overweight this. Nevertheless, I am interested in opinions.\r\n\r\nI would also be interested in an opinion by the Apache Iceberg team. The Geolake solution is great, but was developed without the Apache Iceberg team. What are the expectations now:\r\n*  Continue to write the specification of Geolake here and use the Geolake changes as their are and add them to Iceberg\r\n* Develop a new specification which is lightweight with mininmal features at the start and evolve the implementation over time? (One can then include geoarrow in this discussion)\r\n* ... sth else\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1712750906/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1712776774","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/8521#issuecomment-1712776774","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/8521","id":1712776774,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85mFuZG","user":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-10T10:30:19Z","updated_at":"2023-09-10T10:30:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The

The implementation added to `BaseMetastoreCatalog` here seems strange to me because it has so many implementations that throw `UnsupportedOperationException`. I don't think that adding `ViewCatalog` to that base class is a good idea because it implements so little of the interface -- I'd rather use a util class of helpers or some alternative.\r\n> \r\n> That PR is one idea. I don't think I like it either, but it at least demonstrates one way to accomplish the same goal. It also shows to how fix tests without needing `CatalogWithViews`.\r\n> \r\n> I think that the problem this was trying to solve is to provide a base implementation to catalogs already inheriting from `BaseMetastoreCatalog`. In that case, I think the cleanest solution is to add a subclass of `BaseMetastoreCatalog` that adds the shared view methods. That can be an abstract class that can leave out all of the unsupported methods. Then to use the new base class, you'd just switch from `extends BaseMetastoreCatalog` to `extends BaseMetastoreViewCatalog`.\r\n\r\nFunny enough, that's exactly the version I had at the very beginning (can be seen in https://github.com/apache/iceberg/commit/582d3673f35dc04147fb959a30e371e1b5e375bd#diff-9c8b69f86aec86aea82cd6675c1c24267d9a9d77d7715c2c792934cb954b328b). There was some feedback from @jackye1995 in https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/7880#discussion_r1246848836, so I switched things up a bit and landed at the version we're currently seeing here.\r\nI'm ok either way and both approaches have their ups/downs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1714020768/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1714024844","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/8520#issuecomment-1714024844","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/8520","id":1714024844,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85mKfGM","user":{"login":"amogh-jahagirdar","id":87500546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NTAwNTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87500546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amogh-jahagirdar","html_url":"https://github.com/amogh-jahagirdar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amogh-jahagirdar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amogh-jahagirdar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amogh-jahagirdar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amogh-jahagirdar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amogh-jahagirdar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amogh-jahagirdar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amogh-jahagirdar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amogh-jahagirdar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amogh-jahagirdar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-11T14:38:58Z","updated_at":"2023-09-11T14:45:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rdblue As I was looking into writing tests for this, I think in practice we end up not hitting the scenario described (at least as far as I understand). The reason is currently after the transaction is committed successfully the clean up only cleans up uncommitted files. https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/BaseTransaction.java#L455 . The same logic exists at the `SnapshotProducer` level as well. https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/MergingSnapshotProducer.java#L931 . So if a manifest file were to get reused and successfully committed in the transaction, it would be part of the `committedFiles` and never be deleted.
