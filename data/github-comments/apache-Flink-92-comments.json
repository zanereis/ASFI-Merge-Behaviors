I thought the road map would go to Row which store binary data.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/191621309/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/191639327","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1729#issuecomment-191639327","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1729","id":191639327,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MTYzOTMyNw==","user":{"login":"hsaputra","id":105434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTQzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/105434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra","html_url":"https://github.com/hsaputra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-03T07:53:29Z","updated_at":"2016-03-03T07:53:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Should be a link from CONTRIBUTING page to this one.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/191639327/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/191670391","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1738#issuecomment-191670391","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1738","id":191670391,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MTY3MDM5MQ==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-03T09:18:06Z","updated_at":"2016-03-03T09:18:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Merged to `tableOnCalcite`\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/191670391/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/191670689","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1747#issuecomment-191670689","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1747","id":191670689,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MTY3MDY4OQ==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-03T09:18:35Z","updated_at":"2016-03-03T09:18:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Merged to `tableOnCalcite`.

So for now I wanted to keep it simple until we figure out a good way to do it.\n\n@StephanEwen The window operator cannot call the rich methods since it doesn't know that there is one in there. The rich method lifecycle has to somehow be managed by the StateBackend/State. So then you need to figure out when to call the methods. When creating the StateBackend it's not possible since the state is not there yet. So you maybe call it when the state is first created. Do you call close when you clean out the state for all keys, since then the state is technically not there anymore. Then, do you call open again when it is created again? Also, what about the state methods on RuntimeContext. I don't think you can use ordinary RichFunctions there. (Same probably goes for most of the other methods on RuntimeContext.)\n\nI think we need to find another way for these methods to have some kind of lifecycle management but it requires some thought.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/191681857/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/191683975","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1562#issuecomment-191683975","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1562","id":191683975,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MTY4Mzk3NQ==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-03T09:51:49Z","updated_at":"2016-03-03T09:51:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Okay, that sounds like a design flaw in hiding the aggregating functions completely from the window operator in the state.

think, this does not solve the problem of the test.

Could you maybe open an issue for that here: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK\n\nIn the meantime, I have a workaround for you. You can use a modified version of the CountTrigger:\n\n```\npublic class ClosingCountTrigger<W extends Window> extends Trigger<Object, W> {\n    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;\n\n    private final long maxCount;\n\n    private final ValueStateDescriptor<Long> stateDesc =\n            new ValueStateDescriptor<>(\"count\", LongSerializer.INSTANCE, 0L);\n\n\n    private ClosingCountTrigger(long maxCount) {\n        this.maxCount = maxCount;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public TriggerResult onElement(Object element, long timestamp, W window, TriggerContext ctx) throws IOException {\n        ValueState<Long> count = ctx.getPartitionedState(stateDesc);\n        long currentCount = count.value() + 1;\n        count.update(currentCount);\n        if (currentCount >= maxCount) {\n            count.update(0L);\n            return TriggerResult.FIRE_AND_PURGE;\n        }\n\n        // register timer for final watermark\n        ctx.registerEventTimeTimer(Long.MAX_VALUE);\n        return TriggerResult.CONTINUE;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public TriggerResult onEventTime(long time, W window, TriggerContext ctx) {\n        // final triggering\n        return TriggerResult.FIRE_AND_PURGE;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public TriggerResult onProcessingTime(long time, W window, TriggerContext ctx) throws Exception {\n        return TriggerResult.CONTINUE;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void clear(W window, TriggerContext ctx) throws Exception {\n        ctx.getPartitionedState(stateDesc).clear();\n        ctx.deleteEventTimeTimer(Long.MAX_VALUE);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String toString() {\n        return \"ClosingCountTrigger(\" +  maxCount + \")\";\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Creates a trigger that fires once the number of elements in a pane reaches the given count.\n     *\n     * @param maxCount The count of elements at which to fire.\n     * @param <W> The type of {@link Window Windows} on which this trigger can operate.\n     */\n    public static <W extends Window> ClosingCountTrigger<W> of(long maxCount) {\n        return new ClosingCountTrigger<>(maxCount);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nyou can use it like this:\n\n```\nstream\n    .keyBy(...)\n    .window(GlobalWindows.create())\n    .trigger(ClosingCountTrigger.of(<my count>)\n    .apply() // or .reduce()\n```\n\nThis will behave like the normal count trigger but also register a callback for the final `Long.MAX_VALUE` watermark. Then, when the final watermark arrives it will trigger one last window emission.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/192241682/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/192259307","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1704#issuecomment-192259307","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1704","id":192259307,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MjI1OTMwNw==","user":{"login":"stefanobaghino","id":1374489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzQ0ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1374489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanobaghino","html_url":"https://github.com/stefanobaghino","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanobaghino/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanobaghino/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanobaghino/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanobaghino/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanobaghino/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanobaghino/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanobaghino/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanobaghino/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanobaghino/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-04T12:21:39Z","updated_at":"2016-03-04T12:21:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tillrohrmann Yes, I've already fixed them locally, thanks for the notice and for pinging me.

Maybe we should do another refactoring before merging back to master?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/193194745/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/193258420","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1754#issuecomment-193258420","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1754","id":193258420,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MzI1ODQyMA==","user":{"login":"vasia","id":498957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5ODk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/498957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia","html_url":"https://github.com/vasia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-07T14:03:30Z","updated_at":"2016-03-07T14:03:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Merging this.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/193258420/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/193258467","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1761#issuecomment-193258467","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1761","id":193258467,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MzI1ODQ2Nw==","user":{"login":"vasia","id":498957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5ODk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/498957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia","html_url":"https://github.com/vasia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-07T14:03:41Z","updated_at":"2016-03-07T14:03:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Merging this one, too.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/193258467/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/193272515","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1553#issuecomment-193272515","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1553","id":193272515,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MzI3MjUxNQ==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-07T14:32:44Z","updated_at":"2016-03-07T14:42:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @ramkrish86, \nI just realized that the approach taken here might not work.
