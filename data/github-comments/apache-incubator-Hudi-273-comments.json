Why do we implement a thrift RPC between the client and server?\r\n\r\nHi @prasannarajaperumal, thanks for reviewing.\r\n\r\nGRPC, HTTP are in my list. \r\nBetween HTTP and RPC, RPC is more efficient that it has compact encoder and reject the redundant protocol design HTTP used. Client and server both have to align with the interface and entity that RPC defined, so it's more controllable and developer shouldn't fully understand the underlateyer data transfer details .For metadata transfer, RPC is much better. \r\nBetween GRPC and Thrift, thrift is stable, common and widely used in the main open source frameworks. It supports muti-language compatibility and has better performance than GRPC.   \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1238443136/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1238450314","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/5064#issuecomment-1238450314","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/5064","id":1238450314,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5J0UCK","user":{"login":"minihippo","id":17903481,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTAzNDgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17903481?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/minihippo","html_url":"https://github.com/minihippo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minihippo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minihippo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minihippo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minihippo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minihippo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minihippo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minihippo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minihippo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minihippo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-06T17:24:49Z","updated_at":"2022-09-06T17:24:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> We have state stored in file system / relational tables and we can have 2 clear implementations of interfaces that enable both.\r\n \r\nActually, we store all informations in metaserver, i.e. timeline、files info (file name, size, partition belongs to and etc.).
