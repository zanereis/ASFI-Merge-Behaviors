you wish that would nice! But I propose that you do the patch against JDK8 branch instead of trunk. Also when doing tests, I suggest the following:\r\n\r\n* Focus more on the method contract instead than existing method behavior. For example having `toString()` to throw a `NullPointerException` is not part of method contract.\r\n* Verify if an existing test is already doing what you want to test. Try to identify what is new in the test you are adding. This is not necessarily a new method, but may be the context in which the method is invoked.\r\n* Avoid, if possible, to mix downstream functionalities in a test. For example `ArrayEnvelopeTest` should not use `GeneralEnvelope` or `ImmutableEnvelope`.\r\n* Choose variable names saying what the data are instead than their type.

Instead of catching exceptions in `DataStoreRegistry`, we continue to let each `DataStoreProvider` decide if an exception is recoverable or fatal. But if a `DataStoreProvider` decides to propagate an exception, a new `CanNotProbeException` allows to specify in which provider the error occurred. Callers can catch this exception and exclude the provider from next probe operations.\r\n\r\nWe do not catch exception in `DataStoreRegistry` because not all exceptions are recoverable. For example an `IOException` caused by a damaged file is not the fault of any particular provider, and should cause the probe operation to stop for all providers. Whether an exception is recoverable or not is a decision left to each `DataStoreProvider`.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of this policy, above commit contains a change in `NetcdfStoreProvider` where all `IOException` are considered recoverable. This is okay because the change is applied in a context where the stream is opened by the UCAR library from a file path specified as a `String`. The data source is a string or a `Path` or a `URL`, etc. There is no damaged `InputStream` left behind.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/sis/issues/comments/943756435/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/sis/issues/comments/946831346","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/sis/pull/24#issuecomment-946831346","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/sis/issues/24","id":946831346,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAKH9x844b3_y","user":{"login":"desruisseaux","id":1324414,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjQ0MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1324414?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/desruisseaux","html_url":"https://github.com/desruisseaux","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desruisseaux/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desruisseaux/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desruisseaux/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desruisseaux/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desruisseaux/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desruisseaux/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desruisseaux/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desruisseaux/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desruisseaux/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-19T15:18:40Z","updated_at":"2021-10-19T15:18:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The documentation improvement has been merged (with editions) in Apache SIS code base.

If we migrate to Gradle before, it would be like doing the migration twice given the amount of changes needed in Gradle scripts and plugins (`buildSrc`) after restructuring to Module Source Hierarchy.\r\n\r\nCurrently the separation is done in commits as below. Those commits are in dependency order, and each of them could be taken as a merge request on its own (git \"squash\" and \"rebase\" were done extensively).\r\n\r\n1. Cleaning work\r\n    * Remove the NetBeans Ant project\r\n    * Remove test JAR files. Consequently tests cannot be executed anymore (temporarily)\r\n2. Partial JPMS\r\n    * Add `module-info.java`. Project can still be executed with Maven, but not tested.\r\n3. Restructuring from Package Hierarchy to Module Source Hierarchy\r\n    * Remove all Maven project files (because they don't work at all with Module Source Hierarchy)\r\n    * Move all Java source files to their new location with no change in any code.\r\n    * Post move cleanup (code changes caused by restructuring are separated in this commit).\r\n4. Migrage from Maven to Gradle.\r\n    * Add Gradle build scripts, adapted to Module Source Hierarchy.\r\n    * Documentation updates (mostly editions in Javadoc).\r\n\r\nAs seen above, the commits are in 4 groups which could be separated in 4 merge requests. The reason why they are proposed in a single merge request is because the project is temporarily unbuildable and/or untestable during some intermediate steps. The project is back to buildable and testable state only after the last commit (ignoring the documentation updates).\r\n\r\nSo would it still be better to split in 2 or more merge requests anyway?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/sis/issues/comments/1668622209/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/sis/issues/comments/1668627126","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/sis/pull/37#issuecomment-1668627126","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/sis/issues/37","id":1668627126,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAKH9x85jdTq2","user":{"login":"nknize","id":830187,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMDE4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/830187?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize","html_url":"https://github.com/nknize","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-07T21:54:35Z","updated_at":"2023-08-08T15:05:33Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This is a great explanation.

This merge request contains commits that couldn't be moved to the \"pre-migration\" phase.\r\n\r\nThe reason why JPMS had to be done before Gradle migration is because the _Module Source Hierarchy_ is not just about resolving package name clashes. It is a more disruptive feature, supported by standard Java tools since Java 9 but not well known, maybe because neither Gradle or Maven supports it (but Gradle flexibility makes possible to get it working anyway). Module Source Hierarchy is explained briefly in the [Directory Hierarchies](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/docs/specs/man/javac.html#directory-hierarchies) section of Oracle's documentation. I tried to explain more in section 1 of [Java Module Source Hierarchy in a Gradle sub-project](https://geomatys.github.io/draft/Modularization.html) page. Finally I opened issue https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/25974 for better support of this feature. It is the application of Module Source Hierarchy, not the addition of `module-info.java` files, which implies a very different way to build the Gradle scripts. So JPMS cannot be moved after Gradle migration, because the migration work is too different depending if done before or after Module Source Hierarchy.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/sis/issues/comments/1670467970/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/sis/issues/comments/1678669813","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/sis/pull/37#issuecomment-1678669813","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/sis/issues/37","id":1678669813,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAKH9x85kDnf1","user":{"login":"desruisseaux","id":1324414,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjQ0MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1324414?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/desruisseaux","html_url":"https://github.com/desruisseaux","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desruisseaux/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desruisseaux/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desruisseaux/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desruisseaux/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desruisseaux/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desruisseaux/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desruisseaux/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desruisseaux/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desruisseaux/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-15T09:42:26Z","updated_at":"2023-08-15T09:42:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This task is recorded in JIRA issue https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SIS-582.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/sis/issues/comments/1678669813/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/sis/issues/comments/1684922855","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/sis/pull/36#issuecomment-1684922855","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/sis/issues/36","id":1684922855,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAKH9x85kbeHn","user":{"login":"desruisseaux","id":1324414,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjQ0MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1324414?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/desruisseaux","html_url":"https://github.com/desruisseaux","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desruisseaux/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desruisseaux/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desruisseaux/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desruisseaux/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desruisseaux/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desruisseaux/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desruisseaux/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desruisseaux/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desruisseaux/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-19T11:27:26Z","updated_at":"2023-08-19T11:27:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Since #37 the build system is no longer Maven (it is now Gradle), so this pull request can not be merged anymore.
