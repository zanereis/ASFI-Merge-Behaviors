It seems CI is hitting some new test failures around NodeRestartTest and SnapshotTest, I haven't looked into them yet.\r\n\r\n@pkolaczk @adelapena I think the failures are due to us calling `validatePerIndexComponents()` and `validatePerSSTableComponents()` in `IndexDescriptor` w/ `IndexValidation.NONE` rather than not at all. The counter injections in `SAITester` depend on this. You could fix by changing them to...\r\n\r\n```\r\nprotected static final Injections.Counter perSSTableValidationCounter = Injections.newCounter(\"PerSSTableValidationCounter\")\r\n                                                                                  .add(newInvokePoint().onClass(OnDiskFormat.class)\r\n                                                                                                       .onMethod(\"validatePerSSTableIndexComponents\"))\r\n                                                                                  .build();\r\n\r\nprotected static final Injections.Counter perColumnValidationCounter = Injections.newCounter(\"PerColumnValidationCounter\")\r\n                                                                                 .add(newInvokePoint().onClass(OnDiskFormat.class)\r\n                                                                                                      .onMethod(\"validatePerColumnIndexComponents\"))\r\n                                                                                 .build();\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter that, `shouldTakeAndRestoreSnapshots()` in `SnapshotTest` will still fail, and that's because the test was always incorrect. Changing line 107 to `assertValidationCount(4, 2);` should properly verify that full rebuild checksums the SSTable-level index components.\r\n\r\nAlright, on to the rest of the review.
