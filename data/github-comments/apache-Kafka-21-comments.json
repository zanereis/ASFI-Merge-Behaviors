If you could explain the scenario you're worried about, I'd appreciate.\n\n> command line argument which is quietly ignored \n\nI wouldn't say that the command-line argument is ignored, instead it has lower precedence, so you need to set at least one. \n\n> the system property is overridden by an option\n\nMaybe this comment is stale at this point, but we currently don't really override when the system property is set. If the system property is set, then the command-line option is ignored. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/151989215/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/151990402","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/362#issuecomment-151990402","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/362","id":151990402,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MTk5MDQwMg==","user":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-28T21:07:55Z","updated_at":"2015-10-28T21:07:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks, LGTM.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/151990402/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/152018118","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/361#issuecomment-152018118","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/361","id":152018118,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MjAxODExOA==","user":{"login":"junrao","id":132330,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjMzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/132330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-28T22:33:55Z","updated_at":"2015-10-28T22:33:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the patch.

The offset topic message has three versions. 0 and 1 refer to offset message, and 2 refers to group metadata message.\n2. Group metadata message contains the selected protocol only, with the subscription and assignment stored as byte arrays. Hence after loading each member will only have the single selected protocol stored, and future join-group requests will multiple supported protocols will be considered as new join requests.\n3. When loading the topic from log upon `becomeLeader`, the background thread goes through the message, and based on the key read from the log decided to choose different manner for reading the value (offset or group metadata), and pushing them to respective caches.\n4. Metadata cache depend on the underlying `Pool` for concurrent access, while offset cache has two separate locks for \"range access''. One is for expiring old offsets from the scheduler thread, the other one is for clearing the cache entries upon `becomeFollower`. Offset fetches will only be guarded by the clearing cache lock. This is basically the same as the old `OffsetManager`.\n5. Upon finishing the sync phase, coordinator writes the single-message into the replica manager with the ack mode, and triggers `propogateAssignment` upon completing write.\n6. Coordinator check \"partition loading in progress\" while handling Join / Leave / OffsetCommit / OffsetFetch (we do not check upon Sync and HB), and client handle this error code as retry / ignore / retry / retry.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/152357117/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/152359893","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/385#issuecomment-152359893","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/385","id":152359893,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MjM1OTg5Mw==","user":{"login":"ewencp","id":47366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp","html_url":"https://github.com/ewencp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-29T23:54:24Z","updated_at":"2015-10-29T23:54:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@granders LGTM to solve the immediate issue.

Note that the system test has uncovered a few issues which I fixed in the last couple of commits -- they are unrelated except for the fact that the REST API system test revealed them.\n\nThe only comment I don't think I directly addressed was the `PUT` vs `POST`. I can see arguments both ways, so I'm not tied to either in particular. Let me know if you'd prefer the `PUT` version, it should only be a couple of lines change.\n\nI'm also aware of one other issue that can cause system test failures -- because sink tasks join their consumer group during their start(), and that start() currently occurs in the DistributedHerder's worker thread, it can cause that thread to block for long enough to miss heartbeats, then have to rejoin (which can also take awhile as other members need to heartbeat). As far as I can tell, nothing fundamentally breaks and we could probably resolve it just by increasing timeouts in the test (the failure is that some data doesn't appear downstream as quickly as we would like, but it should get there eventually once all the membership issues are worked out). However, I'd also just like to figure out how to get that work out of the DistributedHerder's thread -- invoking any 3rd party code in that thread is potentially risky. I don't think we want to roll that into this patch though.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/152424083/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/152456094","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/328#issuecomment-152456094","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/328","id":152456094,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MjQ1NjA5NA==","user":{"login":"onurkaraman","id":529976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyOTk3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/529976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman","html_url":"https://github.com/onurkaraman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-30T08:09:38Z","updated_at":"2015-10-30T08:11:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"My bad.
