Take a look for example at: `SelectStarQueryDUnitTets::testSelectStarQueryForPartitionedRegion`. In these cases, you cannot set the thread local observer in the thread that will execute the query because the query is executed remotely from the client.\r\n\r\nI have been able to change the test cases in `QueryUsingFunctionContextDUnitTest` and set the observer in the function executing the queries instead of globally in the servers but this approach is not valid for the test cases previously mentioned.\r\n\r\nI am also worried about the use done by the `QueryObserver` to provide `trace` information in queries. It is not possible to set a query observer and at the same time have trace information.\r\n\r\nWe could also go for having two variables in the `QueryObserverHolder`: a thread local one and the current global one. Setting the instance could set the value in the global one and getting the instance could check if the thread local has a value. If it does, it would return it. Otherwise, the thread local one would be set to the global one value and then be returned. That way, during a query execution, only the first call to `getInstance()` should require synchronization.\r\nWhat do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/934499121/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/934583378","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/6924#issuecomment-934583378","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/6924","id":934583378,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAhObV843tJxS","user":{"login":"mhansonp","id":26558973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTU4OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26558973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp","html_url":"https://github.com/mhansonp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-05T16:49:01Z","updated_at":"2021-10-05T16:49:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> This seems like a potential departure from what the user might expect the behaviour to be.

As you work on these system properties, take a look at geode's SystemPropertyHelper. The idea of this was to have one place we could look and find all of the system properties geode has. We never have taken the time to move all of geode's sys props into it but the ones that are in it serve as some good examples.\r\n> \r\n> I don't think we should add the redis sys props to it mainly because we want redis to possibly be its own module. But we could have a single RedisSystemPropertyHelper and we could define in it every system property geode-for-redis has. The helper could also make clear what our naming convention for redis system properties is (just like the geode helper supports both the geode. and gemfire. prefix). You don't need to do this as part of this PR but its something worth considering.\r\n\r\n@dschneider-pivotal Some of the system properties are loaded via SystemPropertyHelper, but the class using SystemPropertyHelper has the actual property constant and default value. It's still easy to find all system properties using \"find usages\" of SystemPropertyHelper. I think that's probably better than hardcoding all of our system properties in SystemPropertyHelper classes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/941254758/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/941266748","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/6874#issuecomment-941266748","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/6874","id":941266748,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAhObV844Gpc8","user":{"login":"kirklund","id":1444301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDQzMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1444301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund","html_url":"https://github.com/kirklund","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-12T18:24:21Z","updated_at":"2021-10-12T19:30:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@albertogpz @jhuynh1 `AcceptorImpl` is the class that runs server-side threads to execute requests from clients.

When the server starts a `AcceptorImpl` thread to process that query, set that same `ThreadLocal` on that thread.\r\n\r\nThe query execution then adds the instance of `QueryObserver` to the `ExecutionContext`.\r\n\r\nDon't forget to call `ThreadLocal.remove()` after a query completes.\r\n\r\n`OrderByComparator` has a call to `QueryObserverHolder.getInstance()`.

What I don't understand is: why does that argument apply only to ports in the membership port range? Seems to me that any method that purports to return an \"available port range\" is misguided. What am I missing here?\r\n\r\nThe key is that the membership port range overlaps with each operating system's ephemeral port range. The operating system is free to give those ports to anyone who asks for an ephemeral port. Many tests launch members in a way that uses ephemeral ports, making the risk significantly higher in CI than in normal use.\r\n\r\nA port in any other range (such as the \"available port\" range) is likely to be put into use only if a caller specifically asks for that port. We have a fairly strong convention to use those ports only after checking their availability. And the way tests check availability significantly minimizes the risk of conflict. The risk is minimized by the build system allocating a distinct range of ports to each concurrently-executing test JVM, and by `AvailablePortHelper` allocating those ports round-robin instead of randomly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/943732746/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/943741163","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/6986#issuecomment-943741163","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/6986","id":943741163,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAhObV844QFjr","user":{"login":"demery-pivotal","id":45369324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzY5MzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45369324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/demery-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-14T21:17:48Z","updated_at":"2021-10-14T21:17:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> What about `AvailablePort.main()`?
