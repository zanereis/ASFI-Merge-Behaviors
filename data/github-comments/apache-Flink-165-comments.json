It means all subclasses need to implement this constructor and that is not enforced to do so.\r\n\r\nAlthough we can update all subclasses with an one-argument constructor which takes `env` only, I think it is not safer than setting `env` by calling a final method.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?

I addressed your comments, but only then realized that the restriction to relative file state handle is actually a problem for externalized checkpoints. :-( They possibly store their meta data somewhere else and not as part of the checkpoint files. For them it's OK to not be relocatable. Still, I agree with your comment that this should be more explicitly allowed or disallowed. I gues that we should explicitly distinguish between savepoints and externalized checkpoints for the meta data serialization. I hope that Stephan's refactorings of the checkpoint stream creation logic will help here. I'll leave this PR open with your suggested changes and adjust it after Stephan's PR. Then I can either piggyback on his changes or see whether I need to add the required distinction myself.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/284457747/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/284459008","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3474#issuecomment-284459008","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3474","id":284459008,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NDQ1OTAwOA==","user":{"login":"tony810430","id":14329393,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzI5Mzkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14329393?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tony810430","html_url":"https://github.com/tony810430","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tony810430/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tony810430/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tony810430/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tony810430/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tony810430/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tony810430/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tony810430/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tony810430/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tony810430/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-06T16:56:06Z","updated_at":"2017-03-07T05:35:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi, @StephanEwen \r\n\r\nI mean although all subclasses will be forced to call the one-argument constructor, it doesn't force all subclasses need to have the one-argument constructor.
