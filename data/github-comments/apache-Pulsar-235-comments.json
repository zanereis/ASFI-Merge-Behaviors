Is that reason enough to have it?\r\n- also, what kind of filters should pulsar itself be in the business of providing? I only created a few to prove out the feature, but they also cover a relatively large amount of my use-case.\r\n- Is there a better way to send over arguments to the filter? I used KeyValue since it was convenient, but sending serialized objects of some sort would be much nicer (and necessary for flink integration, as far as I can tell)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/662516721/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/662519789","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/7629#issuecomment-662519789","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/7629","id":662519789,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2MjUxOTc4OQ==","user":{"login":"merlimat","id":62500,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat","html_url":"https://github.com/merlimat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-22T15:27:00Z","updated_at":"2020-07-22T15:27:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"For changes that introduce new features or protocol changes, it's recommended to submit a PIP (design doc) for discussion to the mailing list.

I am willing to take over this issue.

Retry on certain errors till success or session expired.\r\n2. Reestablish existing ownership in ownership querying and acquiring.\r\n\r\nI think first approach can't or hard to provide correctness due to reasons:\r\n* It is hard to take appropriate actions for all error conditions.\r\n* It can't handle disconnected-connected-disconnected-... dance.\r\nBut I think retry approach indeed provides api usability and caller friendliness.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, the second approach admits that we could not provide correct result in certain condition, but we can provide correct result with manually retry after that possibly temporary condition solved later.\r\n\r\nSo, I tend to fix this issue by reestablish existing ownership in later ownership querying and acquiring. In future, we can retry on failure automatically to improve caller friendliness without sacrifice correctness.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/663863578/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/663868786","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/6298#issuecomment-663868786","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/6298","id":663868786,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2Mzg2ODc4Ng==","user":{"login":"merlimat","id":62500,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat","html_url":"https://github.com/merlimat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-25T15:37:23Z","updated_at":"2020-07-25T15:37:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm seeing this rather frequently. @massakam Can you take a look?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/663868786/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/663870314","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/6752#issuecomment-663870314","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/6752","id":663870314,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2Mzg3MDMxNA==","user":{"login":"sergescevenels-naspers","id":40430881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNDMwODgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40430881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergescevenels-naspers","html_url":"https://github.com/sergescevenels-naspers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergescevenels-naspers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergescevenels-naspers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergescevenels-naspers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergescevenels-naspers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergescevenels-naspers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergescevenels-naspers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergescevenels-naspers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergescevenels-naspers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergescevenels-naspers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-25T15:51:39Z","updated_at":"2020-07-25T15:51:39Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"By using custom docker images as function runtime, could we actually consider the possibility to have pulsar functions language agnostic ?
