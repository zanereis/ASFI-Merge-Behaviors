Eg. without exporting org.apache.wicket.markup.html.internal package is not possible to use Wicket in OSGi. Do you really use it in OSGi without problems? I wonder how is this possible, maybe you don't use the code which requires abstractions from this packages?\r\n\r\nKeep in mind-- if you need to extend packages that have not been exported you can create a fragment bundle to attach your extension classes. Generally, things like 'internal' are _not_ exported since they are not part of a proper API or SPI.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/1263988806/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/1263991579","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/wicket/pull/540#issuecomment-1263991579","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/540","id":1263991579,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmTM5LVvsb","user":{"login":"dstoch","id":983937,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MzkzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/983937?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstoch","html_url":"https://github.com/dstoch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstoch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstoch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstoch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstoch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstoch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstoch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstoch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstoch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstoch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-30T20:25:58Z","updated_at":"2022-09-30T20:25:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Generally, things like 'internal' are not exported since they are not part of a proper API or SPI.\r\n\r\nIn OSGi world it is indeed.

The API+SPI should be separated into its own jar and only include interfaces and POJO classes.

changeset\r\n- [ ] [Adopt Java 17 code patterns](https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/recipes/java/migrate) - small changeset\r\n\r\nTypically the process is choosing a migration recipe, running a one-off command, visually inspecting the changes, running the tests and opening up a pull request.\r\n\r\nPersonally I find these automated migrations fun to do, especially on larger code bases, but like I said: I don't want to overwhelm for at times small improvements. Any feedback on what types of changes would (not) be appreciated would help to ensure a positive experience for all.
