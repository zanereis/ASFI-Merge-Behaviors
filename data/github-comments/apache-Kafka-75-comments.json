The broker should really be returning an error when an unsupported request arrives.\n\nThis was discussed and agreed upon as part of KIP-35. Below is an excerpt.\n\n> Java clients will use this API to assert that current API versions are all supported by the brokers it is talking to, and raise an exception if they are not. Java clients check will test the new API.\n\nI think it has value to know that clients are not compatible with brokers it is trying to talk to, rather than getting connection dropped or similar not so sure response.\n\n> What would be really cool is making the Java client support multiple broker versions. But that would require a discussion in the mailing list and it would be a bigger change.\n\nThis was proposed in KIP-35 and was shot down. We should definitely give it a try again, but as you said this will be a larger and lengthier discussion.

I haven't looked too deeply, but this seems like a promising approach to me. How do you plan to hook into the different places where metrics are exposed? The consumer metrics are currently spread across several classes (e.g. ConsumerCoordinator, NetworkClient, Fetcher, etc). I could imagine creating a `ConsumerMetrics` class which maybe links to all of these in some way. Then we could include the main method in that class just like we do with `ConsumerConfig`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/228255850/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/228269764","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1437#issuecomment-228269764","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1437","id":228269764,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyODI2OTc2NA==","user":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-24T06:40:51Z","updated_at":"2016-06-24T06:40:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"We also need a note in upgrade.html.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/228269764/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/228275406","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1549#issuecomment-228275406","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1549","id":228275406,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyODI3NTQwNg==","user":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-24T07:21:46Z","updated_at":"2016-06-24T07:21:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@dguy Any idea why it would fail?

All those discussions happened with 0.10.0 in mind, which has now been released and this part of the KIP didn't make it into that release. Part of the motivation for this part was to ensure that ApiVersions request worked properly. That's a weaker argument now since we have already released it and we relied on other clients to test it for us.\n\nI agree that there is value in knowing that clients are not compatible with brokers (which was the main motivation). However, we are only doing it this way because we don't have a way to return a generic error on any request, which is a bit of a shame.\n\nOn the topic of supporting multiple broker versions, yes, KIP-35 wasn't the right place for that. However, now that KIP-35 is in, it could be considered again. It's weird that the Java clients don't support this when third-party clients do. If we did this, there would be less of a need to backport client fixes to older versions (which people often can't upgrade because of the brokers). Anyway, it would be interesting to think if the approach we are doing now could be extended in that direction.\n\nIt just occurred to me that we are not handling the SASL case correctly. For that case, we need to send the `ApiVersionsRequest` before the `SaslHandshakeRequest` (see `SaslClientAuthenticator`). Right?\n\nFinally, I don't mean to block this from going in, I was just sharing my thoughts on the subject. Since there is value and it was approved as part of KIP-35, as long as we can ensure that we don't break existing behaviour and that the new functionality works correctly, it seems like it can go in.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/228292359/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/228293683","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1547#issuecomment-228293683","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1547","id":228293683,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyODI5MzY4Mw==","user":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-24T08:57:56Z","updated_at":"2016-06-24T08:57:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Jenkins failures are unrelated, I ran the tests locally and they passed.\n\nMerged to 0.9.0.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/228293683/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/228296495","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1549#issuecomment-228296495","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1549","id":228296495,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyODI5NjQ5NQ==","user":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-24T09:11:14Z","updated_at":"2016-06-24T09:11:14Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@dguy mentioned offline that the code paths the leftJoin is executing are covered by other tests, and hence why he suggested removing the test.

This will make sure that we will have at least this basic check in Java clients in the next release. I have plans on using KIP-35's support to make rolling upgrade easier and along that we can initiate thoughts around adding support for multiple brokers. I am sure that it is going to take some time, however we definitely will have more insight as third party clients would have some working examples for us to point at.
