Start NetBeans with a clean userdir (I run on linux from zip with: `bin/netbeans-18/bin/netbeans --userdir csstest --cachedir csstest`)\r\n2. Create a new HTML5 Project: File -> New Project, Choose Category \"HTML5/Javascript\", select \"HTML5/JS Application\" and then \"Next\"\r\n3. Wait until the feature is activated\r\n4. Accept defaults by pressing \"Finish\"\r\n5. Create a new file `test.css` in the `Site Root` folder:\r\n  ```css\r\n  .error {\r\n      color: firebrick;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  .ok {\r\n      color: darkgreen;\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n6. Open the pre-generated file `index.html`\r\n7. Insert an empty line after the last `metatag` and fill it with:\r\n  ```html\r\n  <link href=\"test.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" />\r\n  ```\r\n8. Place caret behind the `div` of the `div`-Element in the body and enter ` class=\"`\r\n9. Call code completion (CTRL+Space)\r\n\r\nThis is what I get:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/assets/2179736/320a1b43-7660-4800-b970-c40378f46bfc)\r\n\r\nThis looks ok to me.\r\n\r\nThe steps don't need to be like that, if you have a project you can share or better a minimal project, that only contains required parts, and can tell me how to reproduce the problem it is ok too. Essentially a packed project will eliminate the setup steps.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1629742142/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1629776923","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/6175#issuecomment-1629776923","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/6175","id":1629776923,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5hJGwb","user":{"login":"XIAOXIAOSIYU","id":5882117,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODIxMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5882117?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XIAOXIAOSIYU","html_url":"https://github.com/XIAOXIAOSIYU","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XIAOXIAOSIYU/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XIAOXIAOSIYU/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XIAOXIAOSIYU/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XIAOXIAOSIYU/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XIAOXIAOSIYU/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XIAOXIAOSIYU/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XIAOXIAOSIYU/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XIAOXIAOSIYU/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XIAOXIAOSIYU/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-10T21:48:37Z","updated_at":"2023-07-10T21:52:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"When I said I tried this problem on a new project, we almost did the same thing, the only difference is I didn't put the CSS style class in a separate .css file, I wrote them directly in the HTML file between <`head></head>`, the result is the same,  Intellisense does not display anything.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1629776923/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1629780143","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/6175#issuecomment-1629780143","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/6175","id":1629780143,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5hJHiv","user":{"login":"XIAOXIAOSIYU","id":5882117,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODIxMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5882117?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XIAOXIAOSIYU","html_url":"https://github.com/XIAOXIAOSIYU","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XIAOXIAOSIYU/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XIAOXIAOSIYU/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XIAOXIAOSIYU/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XIAOXIAOSIYU/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XIAOXIAOSIYU/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XIAOXIAOSIYU/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XIAOXIAOSIYU/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XIAOXIAOSIYU/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XIAOXIAOSIYU/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-10T21:51:39Z","updated_at":"2023-07-10T21:51:39Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Before coming here, I spent a lot of time searching online for a solution.

There are two improvements that I suggest:\r\n> \r\n> * Bind an event to the `source` and `target` text fields: Currently, there is a warning message displayed when a path is added directly in the text field. To improve this, you can bind an event to the text fields so that the warning message is automatically removed when a path is added directly into the text fields instead of using the browse button.\r\n> * Remove the package goal from the execution command: It seems that the execution command is invoking the `maven-war-plugin` unnecessarily. To optimize the command, you can remove the package goal, as it may not be required for your specific use case. This will help streamline the execution process and remove any unnecessary steps.\r\n\r\nalready done, please
