a look at how business events are implemented in Fineract. I believe the same way you can do it asynchronously by listening to required events. By this approach you no need to modify all API resources. \nI hope I am clear enough to you :-)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/261240802/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/261241977","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/244#issuecomment-261241977","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/244","id":261241977,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI0MTk3Nw==","user":{"login":"nazeer1100126","id":13728454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzI4NDU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13728454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nazeer1100126","html_url":"https://github.com/nazeer1100126","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nazeer1100126/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nazeer1100126/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nazeer1100126/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nazeer1100126/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nazeer1100126/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nazeer1100126/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nazeer1100126/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nazeer1100126/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nazeer1100126/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-17T13:06:58Z","updated_at":"2016-11-17T13:06:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The subject line should be \"New User Information\" or 'Welcome to [Organization] Name'.

think I have followed the same design as the implementation of business events.\n\n> You no need to modify all API resources\n\nI have used only the publish method call from the API resources like \n`this.publisher.publishEvent(Event Object)` similar to what the business design uses i.e `this.businessEventNotifierService.notifyBusinessEventToBeExecuted(some parameters)`\n\nReasons why me and my mentor(Pranjal) decided  to use an external queue :-\n1. if we don't use an external queue we can be at a disadvantage of loosing messages if the listener ceases to stop working. \n2. This design follows pub-sub pattern which is nowadays generally used to design notification module.\n\nI think the only difference is that business event design uses a Map to store the list of published events and my implementation uses an external queue.\nSo, should I refactor like the one suggested by you or proceed with my implementation ?\nThanks.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/261349654/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/261887760","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/215#issuecomment-261887760","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/215","id":261887760,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTg4Nzc2MA==","user":{"login":"nazeer1100126","id":13728454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzI4NDU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13728454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nazeer1100126","html_url":"https://github.com/nazeer1100126","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nazeer1100126/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nazeer1100126/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nazeer1100126/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nazeer1100126/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nazeer1100126/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nazeer1100126/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nazeer1100126/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nazeer1100126/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nazeer1100126/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-21T09:31:33Z","updated_at":"2016-11-21T09:31:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I see lot of files doesn't belongs to this PR.
