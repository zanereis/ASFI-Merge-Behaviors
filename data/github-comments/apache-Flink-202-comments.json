This PR is actually broken. \r\n\r\nThe reason is that the `comparator` in the `AbstractKeyedCEPPatternOperator` is not `serializable` so when Flink tries to ship the job to the cluster, it will fail with a `NotSerializableException`. \r\n\r\nIf you want to reproduce that, you can modify one of the IT cases in the `CEPITCase`, e.g. the `CEPITCase.testSimplePatternCEP()` and add a comparator in the `DataStream<String> result = CEP.pattern(input, pattern);`\r\n\r\nAfter this is fixed, then I have some more comments on the rest of the implementation:\r\n\r\n1) In the `AbstractKeyedCEPPatternOperator` we do not need a new state for the `bufferedEvents`. We can use the already existing `elementQueueState` and store the timestamps and the elements in the case of processing time, as done in event time. This will lead to better code re-use, as we will be able to use code from the event-time logic. In general, it would be nice to unify in the future the processing- and event-time code paths by also buffering elements and registering timers for processing time, as done in event time. This will also solve the issue of having to wait for the next element to arrive, before being able to emit a timed out pattern in processing time. BUT for this we will need to somehow let the user specify a parameter like the `watermark interval` in event-time, so it needs more discussion.\r\n\r\n2) Typo in the `CEPOperatorTest`: `getKeyedCepOpearatorWithComparator` -> `getKeyedCepOperatorWithComparator`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/320195942/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/320197280","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4474#issuecomment-320197280","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4474","id":320197280,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMDE5NzI4MA==","user":{"login":"StefanRRichter","id":2128543,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjg1NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2128543?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter","html_url":"https://github.com/StefanRRichter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-04T09:02:51Z","updated_at":"2017-08-04T09:02:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi,\r\n\r\nsorry that I saw this PR too late because Jira was hanging and I only saw the email of the opened issue.

Thanks for replying. Indeed, the problem is caused by MetricFetcher isn't synchronizing on the `MetricStore` object in MetricFetcher#addMetrics(). But in my opinion, synchronizing on the `MetricStore`  is less efficient. `MetricStore` wrapps more than one metric stores and they serves different components(e.g Jobmanager，Taskmangers)  individually. If synchronizing on the `MetricStore` , call of addMetrics() on Jobmanger's metric may wait for addMetrics() on another taskmananger's metric done as they both acquire the same lock, which is unnecessary.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/320562488/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/320571846","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4368#issuecomment-320571846","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4368","id":320571846,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMDU3MTg0Ng==","user":{"login":"tzulitai","id":5284370,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODQzNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5284370?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai","html_url":"https://github.com/tzulitai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-07T05:27:12Z","updated_at":"2017-08-07T05:27:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Alright,

@yew1eb,\r\nI'm afraid we should not merge this PR. While I do realise that keeping the code clean is good, I don't think we should just change some parts of the code only to make them look nicer.

@tzulitai ,\r\nLet's reach a consensus before I do any more works.\r\n\r\n1) I didn't add all KPL's configs in this PR. I only added some configs that I think might be useful to Flink users. The full list of KPL configs is [here](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-producer/blob/master/java/amazon-kinesis-producer-sample/default_config.properties). I don't think exposing all KPL configs is a good idea. What do you think?\r\n\r\n2) I absolutely agree that there'd better be a consistent way to keep configs up-tp-date. But there probably isn't as long as Flink wraps around KPL, because right now we have to always set KPL configs in `FlinkKinesisProducer#open()` with `setXxxx()`\r\n\r\n3) If Flink uses [`KinesisProducerConfiguration#fromProperties(Properties props)`](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-producer/blob/master/java/amazon-kinesis-producer/src/main/java/com/amazonaws/services/kinesis/producer/KinesisProducerConfiguration.java) to init `KinesisProducerConfiguration`, users can always pass in the configs as k-v string pairs. But, it requires changing all config values in `ProducerConfigConstants`, e.g. from `aws.producer.aggregationMaxCount` to `AggregationMaxCount`, because KPL library itself doesn't provide a util class with key names as string. How much would the impact be to rename those config keys? \r\n\r\nBowen","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/320787088/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/320827409","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3829#issuecomment-320827409","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3829","id":320827409,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMDgyNzQwOQ==","user":{"login":"lincoln-lil","id":3712895,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MTI4OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3712895?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lincoln-lil","html_url":"https://github.com/lincoln-lil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lincoln-lil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lincoln-lil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lincoln-lil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lincoln-lil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lincoln-lil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lincoln-lil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lincoln-lil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lincoln-lil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lincoln-lil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-08T01:51:05Z","updated_at":"2017-08-08T01:51:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@fhueske  I will continue this PR according to the above conclusions.\r\n\r\nThanks, Lincoln","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/320827409/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/320847146","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4473#issuecomment-320847146","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4473","id":320847146,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMDg0NzE0Ng==","user":{"login":"tzulitai","id":5284370,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODQzNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5284370?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai","html_url":"https://github.com/tzulitai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-08T04:30:17Z","updated_at":"2017-08-08T04:30:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bowenli86 the third option actually strikes me as an overall good solution, I didn't know that was possible.\r\n\r\nI think it would make sense to deprecate the previous configuration keys in favor of the `fromProperties` solution.
