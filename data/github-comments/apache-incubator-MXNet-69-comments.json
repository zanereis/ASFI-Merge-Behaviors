OpenCV, I used `sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev` to install it. And when I used `pkg-config --cflags opencv` to locate the file, the output is `-I/usr/include/opencv`.  However, when I went into `/usr/include` I found there are two files named `opencv` and `opencv2` repectively. \n\nAfter I added either of the two file's absolute path into config.mk's  `ADD_LDFLAGS` and `ADD_CFLAGS`, the make result was `make[1]: Leaving directory '/home/zhaoxiaoming/mxnet/dmlc-core'`.
