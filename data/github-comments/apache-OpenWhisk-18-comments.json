\n_setup.yml_ is used to covered all environments (local, mac, etc). If you use docker-machine, setup will try to find the ip of the docker-machine and fill it in ansible hosts for you. But if you dont use docker-machine, the step is still executed cause setup.yml is not bind to a specific ansible env. In this case, you have this error (cause you don't have docker-machine in your dev env). Ansible will stop if any non-zero is returned, so in order to tell ansible go forward, we have to skip the \"fatal\" error.\n\nHope that I can give you a enough explanation.

In the meantime, there are four options I can think of:\n1. build `swiftActionBase` à la `nodejsActionBase`, keep distinct from `pythonAction`.\n2. build `pythonBase` and make it flexible enough to accommodate the differences in Swift action containers, then use for Python, Swift, Swift3.\n3. make Swift action containers extend from `nodejsActionBase`, making sure it can accommodate it.\n4. do nothing until Swift actions can run in Swift entirely.\n\nThe way I see it, 1. and 4. seem reasonable, 2. & 3. would introduce temporary workarounds with non-obvious benefits.

I suspect the only way this performance advantage could work for Swift is if the action code and the web server were compiled together, which can't really happen in OW.\n\nWhatever language is used for the Swift runtime's web server, in the end it will essentially need to \"shell out\" to run the compiled action binary.
