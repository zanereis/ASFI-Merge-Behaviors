I don't think we should model our reader model over Kafka's model.\r\n2) In order to make Pulsar as real stream storage, we need to take serious consideration on the reader's behavior. I agree we might need more enhancements to strengthen the reader guarantee. But we shouldn't simply drop an existing behavior. \r\n3) For behavior compatibility consideration, we should at least add a flag to control this behavior. \r\n\r\nSo as I said, we need to provide a flag to control the behavior.
