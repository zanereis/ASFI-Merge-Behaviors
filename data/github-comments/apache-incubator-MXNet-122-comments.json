\r\n\r\nhere you are my script for the Rarray data training. i believe i followed the same way as the mnist example to define the R array, the only difference is that mnist is gray scale, so its array format is (28,28,1, length), the cifar-10 is rgb scale, so my array format is (32,32,3,length). but when feed into the train model, the accuracy just cant increase as normal. i already tested this CNN
