@kennknowles \r\n\r\nThere's a couple of unanswered questions, mainly with regards to `POutputs` that aren't `PCollections` - namely that we never visit any composite `POutput` (including `PCollectionLists` and `PDone`), so there's a bit of strange behavior where `getProducer` doesn't work for a composite `PValue`. I have to do a bit of thinking about the desired behavior there - namely, it might be worth adding a `visitOutput` method to `PipelineVisitor` that visits outputs at every node; simultaneously, it would be nice to narrow any API that currently takes `PValue` to take `PCollection` or some other sort of PrimitivePValue (that must expand to itself) as a way of ensuring we can't call with wrong inputs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/264350955/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/264354965","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/1487#issuecomment-264354965","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/1487","id":264354965,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NDM1NDk2NQ==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-02T02:12:59Z","updated_at":"2016-12-02T02:12:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nRefer
