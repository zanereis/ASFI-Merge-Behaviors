those who really really want basic auth and no proxy, here's a way to bolt-on BASIC auth to an existing zipkin server without modifying it.\r\n\r\nOnce you have it together, the below shows how to change password (though there's an example too) https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.1.0.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-security\r\n\r\nThis requires that you have maven installed. You don't need to do any custom code as it is 100% packaging.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# get normal zipkin server\r\n$ curl -sSL https://zipkin.io/quickstart.sh | bash -s\r\n# build the security module\r\n$ mvn clean install\r\n# rename the jar so it is easier\r\n$ mv ./target/security-1.0-SNAPSHOT-module.jar security.jar\r\n# start zipkin which now has BASIC auth on all endpoints\r\n$ java -Dloader.path='security.jar,security.jar!/lib' -cp zipkin.jar  org.springframework.boot.loader.PropertiesLauncher --spring.security.user.name=zipkin --spring.security.user.password=pipkin\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's the only file you need:\r\n```xml\r\n<project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\"\r\n
