@chiwanpark, the PR improved a lot! Besides a few inline comments, the logic and test coverage looks pretty good. Unfortunately, the PR does not seem to build correctly (Check [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/apache/flink/builds/54853098)). I'll do another quick pass tomorrow and have a closer look at the error messages. \n\nIMO, there are just two things left to be discussed before we can test it on a cluster:\n\n**Order of POJO fields**\nThis is actually a crucial point. We need to make sure, that the field order is deterministic for all setups. I think (not sure!) right now, the order of the fields depends on the order in which the fields are returned by Java's reflection tools. This order needs to be standardized to ensure that all JVMs that obey the standard are compatible. However, even a standardized order (lexicographic order) might not be very helpful.\n\nThere are several options here:\n1. If there the order of fields is standardized, just use that by default.\n2. If not, we can deterministically sort the fields ourselves in the PojoTypeInfo.\n3. We make the definition of a field order mandatory until we can define the order of POJO fields (e.g., via the proposed `@Position` annotation).\nI am leaning towards option 3. \n\n**Changed Inheritance of ScalaCsvInputFormat**\nThis is a very good observation, however I would keep the original inheritance for now. At the moment, GenericCsvInputFormat is extended by CsvInputFormat (for Java API), ScalaCsvInputFormat (for Scala API), CsvInputFormat (for Record API), and a test class. We will soon remove the RecordAPI such that only the Java and the Scala API will remain. I think we can then move all common operations to GenericCsvInputFormat (maybe we can do that already...). @chiwanpark does that make sense to you or do you disagree?\n\n@chiwanpark What do you think? Any other opinions?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/85261367/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/85285193","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/426#issuecomment-85285193","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/426","id":85285193,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg1Mjg1MTkz","user":{"login":"chiwanpark","id":1941681,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDE2ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1941681?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark","html_url":"https://github.com/chiwanpark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-24T01:41:02Z","updated_at":"2015-03-24T01:41:02Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@fhueske Hi, Thanks for your kindly advice!

There we can filter the local properties and global properties independently.\n\nThe main benefit is probably to preserve the global properties for `mapPartition()`, which is desirable.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/85422608/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/85425753","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/522#issuecomment-85425753","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/522","id":85425753,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg1NDI1NzUz","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-24T09:48:02Z","updated_at":"2015-03-24T09:48:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks good, the finally block actually takes care of the cleanup.\n\n+1 to merge\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/85425753/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/85426018","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/518#issuecomment-85426018","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/518","id":85426018,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg1NDI2MDE4","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-24T09:49:54Z","updated_at":"2015-03-24T09:49:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Good find, but just calling it in the beginning of every main() method seems hacky.\n\nI think the code should go to the AkkaUtils.createActorSystem() method.

@andralungu! Thanks for this PR. I know it took more effort than you might have thought initially :-)\n\nI have a few comments:\n- In my opinion, the degrees availability and the total number of vertices should be _optional_. Otherwise, we are introducing unnecessary overhead for the majority of cases, i.e. when these are not actually used by an algorithm.\n- The edge direction option and the degrees / numOfVertices should be _separate extensions_ and not tight together, i.e. we should allow a user to choose the edge direction option independently of whether they also want to access the degrees. To be consistent with the rest of the VertexCentricIteration options, we could introduce methods `setMessagingDirection()`, `setInDegreesAvailable()` and so on.\n- The change should be transparent to user code, i.e. if a user has turned on the option for accessing inDegrees, they should be able to call `vertex.getInDegree()` inside the messaging/update functions, but `vertex.getValue()` should still return the vertex value. In other words, this Tuple3 you're using to store the degrees should be hidden from the public methods.\n- Finally, we should add documentation for these options, including description of how they work and some illustrative examples.\n\nLet me know what you think about the above and whether you have any questions!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/86727594/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/86861202","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/533#issuecomment-86861202","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/533","id":86861202,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2ODYxMjAy","user":{"login":"rmetzger","id":89049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger","html_url":"https://github.com/rmetzger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-27T07:52:11Z","updated_at":"2015-03-27T07:52:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank

@vasia ,\n\n1). I will add the documentation once we reach a consensus. No use documenting something that might change :)\n2). For the public setter: I still couldn't think of a workaround. Waiting for suggestions. \n3). Most of the comments were addressed in this final commit, however, when speaking about avoiding unnecessary overhead, the only way I could do that is to add another VertexCentricIteration class that operates on Tuple3 and have the user decide from the constructor which class he/she wants to use. To me that seems to introduce a ton of duplicate code which will look very bad. \n\nKeeping in mind that I need to store the degrees in the vertex value, any suggestions on how to eliminate this overhead would be very useful.\n\nThanks! \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/87425953/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/87462312","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/537#issuecomment-87462312","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/537","id":87462312,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3NDYyMzEy","user":{"login":"vasia","id":498957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5ODk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/498957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia","html_url":"https://github.com/vasia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-29T19:50:43Z","updated_at":"2015-03-29T19:50:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @andralungu!\nRegarding (2), I think you could do that inside VertexCentricIteration instead of inside a method of Graph.\nRegarding (3), I agree that adding another VertexCentricIteration wouldn't be a nice solution.
