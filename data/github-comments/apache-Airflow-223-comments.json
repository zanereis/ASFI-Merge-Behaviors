I know I can work around this by adding a short circuit operator and running the dag everyday, but then I have to add an extra operator to every dag that I want to behave this way and if I'm looking at dag run times, I'll have artificially lower numbers on the weekends.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/487530515/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/487530657","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4967#issuecomment-487530657","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4967","id":487530657,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NzUzMDY1Nw==","user":{"login":"mans2singh","id":8467404,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0Njc0MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8467404?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh","html_url":"https://github.com/mans2singh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-29T10:30:54Z","updated_at":"2019-04-29T10:30:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@XD-DENG and Airflow team - Please let me know if there is anything else outstanding that I need to address for this PR.
