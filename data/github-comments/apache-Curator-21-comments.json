I hit it when using InterProcessMutex#release(), which does a <em>foreground</em> guaranteed delete. It seems that, with guaranteed, a <em>foreground</em> delete turns into a background guaranteed delete (which might also lead to a race condition, but I still have to test that case). At some point, the recursion is triggered and stack overflow is thrown.</p>\n\n<p>I will send a pull request to make FailedDeleteManager#addFailedDelete use a while loop instead of recursion and solve the stack overflow.
