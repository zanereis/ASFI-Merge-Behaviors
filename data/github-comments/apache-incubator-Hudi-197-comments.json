For the latter, we can't just set it as the ordering field; we should leave it not set and then nothing will be calculated or persisted in commit metadata\r\n> * as you reported \"setting returnNullIfNotFound to true does not take effect\", then we should fix that instead of masking it by setting event time\r\n> \r\n> WDYT?\r\n\r\n@xushiyan I remove the codes about setting event.time by precombine.field, but I keep setting ordering.field by precombine.field, is it right?\r\nAnd, for \"setting returnNullIfNotFound to true does not take effect\", I can't fix it soon.

Please note I'm new to Hudi and haven't used v0.5.0, but in theory the following should work:\r\n1. extend [SimpleKeyGenerator](https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/master/hudi-client/hudi-spark-client/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/keygen/SimpleKeyGenerator.java) (or whatever key generator you're currently using, SImpleKeyGenerator is default) and override `getPartitionPath`. That allows you to control partition path.

you for looking into this.\r\n\r\nI don't know how I could count file groups, so I listed all Parquet files in both tables. There's `535 741` files in table_v1 and `371 102` in table_v2. That number doesn't surprise me and if it was any performance indicator, then reading from the first table should be slower.\r\n\r\nYou're absolutely right, 15k is too much. I had issues with executors running out of memory (due to data skew) and tried increasing parallelism. Do you suspect that it could be causing this issue? It's not optimal, but doesn't create a lot of small files. Also, the same parallelism was used with both tables.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry if I wasn't clear, but I had run cleaner on both tables before reading from them. I just tested it again and I can see that the last commit is `*__clean__COMPLETED` commit. What I did was:\r\n1. I run cleaner on the second table\r\n```\r\nspark-submit \\\r\n    --driver-memory 8G \\\r\n    --deploy-mode cluster \\\r\n    --conf \"spark.yarn.maxAppAttempts=1\" \\\r\n    --conf \"spark.dynamicAllocation.maxExecutors=20\" \\\r\n    --class org.apache.hudi.utilities.HoodieCleaner \\\r\n    hudi-utilities-bundle_2.12-0.10.0.jar \\\r\n    --target-base-path s3://bucket/table_v2 \\\r\n    --hoodie-conf hoodie.cleaner.parallelism=10 \\\r\n    --spark-master yarn-cluster\r\n```\r\nThere's was almost nothing to do, so it finished within 2 minutes.\r\n\r\n2. I read one of the partitions in the second table\r\n```\r\ndef time[T](func: => T): T = {\r\n    val t0 = System.nanoTime\r\n    val result = func\r\n    val t1 = System.nanoTime\r\n    println(\"Elapsed time: \" + (t1-t0)/1000000000 + \"s\")\r\n    result\r\n}\r\n\r\ntime { \r\n\tspark.read.format(\"org.apache.hudi\")\r\n\t.option(\"hoodie.metadata.enable\", \"false\")\r\n\t.option(\"hoodie.datasource.read.paths\", \"s3://bucket/table_v2/date=2022-01-01/source=test/type=test\")\r\n\t.load() \r\n}\r\n```\r\nLogs:\r\n```\r\nDataSourceUtils: Getting table path..\r\nTablePathUtils: Getting table path from path : s3://bucket/table_v2/date=2022-01-01/source=test/type=test\r\nDefaultSource: Obtained hudi table path: s3://bucket/table_v2\r\nHoodieTableMetaClient: Loading HoodieTableMetaClient from s3://bucket/table_v2\r\nHoodieTableConfig: Loading table properties from s3://bucket/table_v2/.hoodie/hoodie.properties\r\nHoodieTableMetaClient: Finished Loading Table of type COPY_ON_WRITE(version=1, baseFileFormat=PARQUET) from s3://bucket/table_v2\r\nDefaultSource: Is bootstrapped table => false, tableType is: COPY_ON_WRITE, queryType is: snapshot\r\nDefaultSource: Loading Base File Only View  with options :Map(hoodie.datasource.query.type -> snapshot, hoodie.datasource.read.paths -> s3://bucket/table_v2/date=2022-01-01/source=test/type=test, hoodie.metadata.enable -> false)\r\nHoodieActiveTimeline: Loaded instants upto : Option{val=[20220124110227018__clean__COMPLETED]}\r\nHoodieTableMetaClient: Loading HoodieTableMetaClient from s3://bucket/table_v2\r\nHoodieTableConfig: Loading table properties from s3://bucket/table_v2/.hoodie/hoodie.properties\r\nHoodieTableMetaClient: Finished Loading Table of type COPY_ON_WRITE(version=1, baseFileFormat=PARQUET) from s3://bucket/table_v2\r\nHoodieTableMetaClient: Loading Active commit timeline for s3://bucket/table_v2\r\nHoodieActiveTimeline: Loaded instants upto : Option{val=[20220124110227018__clean__COMPLETED]}\r\nFileSystemViewManager: Creating InMemory based view for basePath s3://bucket/table_v2\r\nAbstractTableFileSystemView: Took 9286 ms to read  17 instants, 15201 replaced file groups\r\nClusteringUtils: Found 0 files in pending clustering operations\r\nAbstractTableFileSystemView: Building file system view for partition (date=2022-01-01/source=test/type=test)\r\nAbstractTableFileSystemView: addFilesToView: NumFiles=40, NumFileGroups=39, FileGroupsCreationTime=3, StoreTimeTaken=0\r\nHoodieROTablePathFilter: Based on hoodie metadata from base path: s3://bucket/table_v2, caching 39 files under s3://bucket/table_v2/date=2022-01-01/source=test/type=test\r\nAbstractTableFileSystemView: Took 8423 ms to read  17 instants, 15201 replaced file groups\r\nClusteringUtils: Found 0 files in pending clustering operations\r\nElapsed time: 20s\r\n```\r\n\r\n3.

However, testing with Presto `0.247` now and I still cannot read the table correctly.\r\n\r\nI did some research and found out Hudi was bumped to `0.9.0` in PrestoDB `0.265` ([PR](https://github.com/prestodb/presto/commit/b52db2c4c2baa720489ae3908acd9303a41081fc), [release notes](https://prestodb.io/docs/current/release/release-0.265.html)). For Presto `<0.265`, Hudi `0.5.3` is installed.\r\n\r\nI believe that's where the problem is. My version of Presto only has Hudi `0.5.3` and thus I cannot correctly read replacecommit files.\r\n\r\nThe [Hudi docs](https://hudi.apache.org/docs/query_engine_setup#PrestoDB) do not mention anything about this issue. It only says \"Presto >= 0.240 | No action needed. Hudi 0.5.3 version is a compile time dependency.\"\r\n\r\nAm I correct assuming Hudi `0.5.3` cannot correctly read replacecommit files?

are the points to consider before we can make DefaultHoodieRecordPayload as default\r\nAs of now, its easier on the write path, bcoz, users can set the payload properties in the write config and all write path can rely on that. But we have quite a few read paths, like RealtimeCompactedRecordReader, RealtimeUnmergedRecordReader,HoodieMergeOnReadRDD which tries to call into getInsert() or combineAndGetUpdate() method on the record payload. \r\nSo, we are in need of serializing the properties in table config and reuse them in these flows. As of now, preCombine field is already part of table config and hence we can set the hoodie.payload.ordering.field based on that. But for \"hoodie.payload.event.time.field\", we don't serialize them to table config as of today. \r\n\r\nSo, if we really want to leverage event time, we might have to add the field to table config. If not, we may not update the event time in some of the read flows. \r\n\r\nThis patch have a close connection with https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/4681. in this patch, we can see where all we might need to read the initialize the payload properties required to be passed into DefaultHoodieRecordPayload method calls. \r\n\r\nWanted to hear your thoughts on this. \r\n@xushiyan @codope @yihua \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1023768290/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1023785526","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/4680#issuecomment-1023785526","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/4680","id":1023785526,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM49Bbo2","user":{"login":"hudi-bot","id":79415918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDE1OTE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79415918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/hudi-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-28T01:01:41Z","updated_at":"2022-01-28T01:01:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\nMeta data\n{\n  \"version\" : 1,\n  \"metaDataEntries\" : [ {\n    \"hash\" : \"5c0772c7406df1ffca39bf75de7d747914be0b26\",\n    \"status\" : \"DELETED\",\n    \"url\" : \"https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=5478\",\n    \"triggerID\" : \"5c0772c7406df1ffca39bf75de7d747914be0b26\",\n    \"triggerType\" : \"PUSH\"\n  }, {\n    \"hash\" : \"ae88c2fc58bf07a435feb971435646258e2b5e87\",\n    \"status\" : \"UNKNOWN\",\n    \"url\" : \"TBD\",\n    \"triggerID\" : \"ae88c2fc58bf07a435feb971435646258e2b5e87\",\n    \"triggerType\" : \"PUSH\"\n  }, {\n    \"hash\" : \"5593a7e380700e7f89c65b44b20dfa4d31a15ea9\",\n    \"status\" : \"DELETED\",\n    \"url\" : \"https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=5481\",\n    \"triggerID\" : \"5593a7e380700e7f89c65b44b20dfa4d31a15ea9\",\n    \"triggerType\" : \"PUSH\"\n  }, {\n    \"hash\" : \"5d9189c4f457e5877280f00d0dcd9ccdb476135f\",\n    \"status\" : \"SUCCESS\",\n    \"url\" : \"https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=5565\",\n    \"triggerID\" : \"5d9189c4f457e5877280f00d0dcd9ccdb476135f\",\n    \"triggerType\" : \"PUSH\"\n  } ]\n}-->\n## CI report:\n\n* ae88c2fc58bf07a435feb971435646258e2b5e87 UNKNOWN\n* 5d9189c4f457e5877280f00d0dcd9ccdb476135f Azure: [SUCCESS](https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=5565) \n\n<details>\n<summary>Bot commands</summary>\n  @hudi-bot supports the following commands:\n\n -
