I was actually referring to modifying the user docs to add the new configs.  look in docs/configuration.md.   \n\nIt makes sense to move it down and get as much initialization stuff out of the way before waiting.  To me exactly which class it goes in depends on how we see it fitting and potentially being used in the future.  You could for instance move it down into submitMissingTasks before the call to submitTasks and leave it in DAGScheduler instead.\n\nI think for this pr where we are just checking initially (job submission) that we have enough executors it doesn't matter to much.  But in the future if we would want to check between stages or potentially when adding tasks then it matters where it goes.  \n\nperhaps @kayousterhout has opinion on where it better fits?   \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/47104091/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/47111959","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1212#issuecomment-47111959","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1212","id":47111959,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MTExOTU5","user":{"login":"AmplabJenkins","id":4031291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzEyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4031291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/AmplabJenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-06-25T14:55:20Z","updated_at":"2014-06-25T14:55:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Can one of the admins verify this patch?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/47111959/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/47118382","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1208#issuecomment-47118382","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1208","id":47118382,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MTE4Mzgy","user":{"login":"witgo","id":302879,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMjg3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/302879?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/witgo","html_url":"https://github.com/witgo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/witgo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/witgo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/witgo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/witgo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/witgo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/witgo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/witgo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/witgo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/witgo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-06-25T15:36:37Z","updated_at":"2014-06-25T15:36:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The main benefit is unified log Interface.

Now consider the case in which you can talk to the master, but there are no workers. Then in the normal case, a simple Spark job leads to the following:\n\n```\n>>> sc.parallelize(range(100)).count()\n14/06/25 11:26:12 INFO SparkContext: Starting job: count at <stdin>:1\n14/06/25 11:26:12 INFO DAGScheduler: Got job 0 (count at <stdin>:1) with 2 output partitions (allowLocal=false)\n14/06/25 11:26:12 INFO DAGScheduler: Final stage: Stage 0(count at <stdin>:1)\n14/06/25 11:26:12 INFO DAGScheduler: Parents of final stage: List()\n14/06/25 11:26:12 INFO DAGScheduler: Missing parents: List()\n14/06/25 11:26:12 INFO DAGScheduler: Submitting Stage 0 (PythonRDD[1] at RDD at PythonRDD.scala:40), which has no missing parents\n14/06/25 11:26:12 INFO DAGScheduler: Submitting 2 missing tasks from Stage 0 (PythonRDD[1] at RDD at PythonRDD.scala:40)\n14/06/25 11:26:12 INFO TaskSchedulerImpl: Adding task set 0.0 with 2 tasks\n14/06/25 11:26:27 WARN TaskSchedulerImpl: Initial job has not accepted any resources; check your cluster UI to ensure that workers are registered and have sufficient memory\n14/06/25 11:26:42 WARN TaskSchedulerImpl: Initial job has not accepted any resources; check your cluster UI to ensure that workers are registered and have sufficient memory\n14/06/25 11:26:57 WARN TaskSchedulerImpl: Initial job has not accepted any resources; check your cluster UI to ensure that workers are registered and have sufficient memory\n...\n```\n\nNow imagine all the WARN messages go away.
