However, I can't find the exact specification about `{@inheritDoc}` now...\r\nCurrently, when PHPDoc has only a single sentence(e.g. Get something.), inline `{@inheritdoc}` is not replaced by anything (e.g. `/** {@inheritdoc} something...*/`).

Its installers are from the Netbeans IDE platform. And when using a specific version of Java (v19 openjdk from oracle) it couldn't be installed because the Java could not be identified.
