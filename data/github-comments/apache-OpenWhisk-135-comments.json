by including routemgmt in that .yml, it now requires openwhisk to have been deployed.  also, any ci/cd pipelines that use a local api gw deployment in some environments, but use an already deployed production api gw in other environments will need new conditional logic when deploying openwhisk to avoid deploying routemgmt twice - a second deployment won't cause a failure, just would take some extra time.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/403146249/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/403147175","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/3760#issuecomment-403147175","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/3760","id":403147175,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMzE0NzE3NQ==","user":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-06T21:07:23Z","updated_at":"2018-07-06T21:07:23Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"By pulling out routemgmt.yml from the openwhisk playbook there's already a need to adjust a deployment: if you need the package, you have to add it to the deployment explicitly.
