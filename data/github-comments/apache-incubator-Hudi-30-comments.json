Our essential purpose is to clear and initialize the inner state of a hoodie table meta client again. Reuse the client object can provide better performance, less object creation, GC frequency. A `reloadMetaClient` or `reInitMetaClient` method has a better expressiveness in a context than re-initialize an instance of `HoodieTableMetaClient`. Actually, when I see this code style firstly, I feel strange, why we always re-initialize the object so many times? Are they redundant or unnecessary? This is my first impression.\r\n\r\nAbout your concern, IMHO, we may not worry about it. Since the developers remember to re-initialize an object they should remember to invoke the `reloadMetaClient` method to achieve the same purpose. They know their motivation, now, they only need to know there is another method can replace the old style to achieve this, and at the same time release the resource ASAP correctly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/535315672/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/535348602","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/927#issuecomment-535348602","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/927","id":535348602,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNTM0ODYwMg==","user":{"login":"bvaradar","id":3021376,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMjEzNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3021376?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar","html_url":"https://github.com/bvaradar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-26T05:53:19Z","updated_at":"2019-09-26T05:53:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Added Jira : HUDI-284\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/535348602/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/535380366","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/917#issuecomment-535380366","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/917","id":535380366,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNTM4MDM2Ng==","user":{"login":"taherk77","id":29517740,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NTE3NzQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29517740?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/taherk77","html_url":"https://github.com/taherk77","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taherk77/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taherk77/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taherk77/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taherk77/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taherk77/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taherk77/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taherk77/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taherk77/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taherk77/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-26T07:38:33Z","updated_at":"2019-09-26T07:38:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @vinothchandar I have created what we discussed.

But the integration test seems to fail? ideas?\r\n\r\n@vinothchandar I noticed an issue with this approach today, and probably thats why the integration tests are failing.\r\n\r\nWhen we will build with the profile `shade-avro` things would be file, but when we build without this profile it can cause other things to break. Because we have always added an `<include>` for the avro dependency as well as `<relocation>` for avro and are just trying to turn shading on or off using `scope`. However, when the scope is `provided`, due to our inclusion of `relocation` section all references to `org.apache.avro` in our code/jar would be replaced with `org.apache.hudi.org.apache.avro`. However, it will not actually find that relocated dependency because it has not actually been shaded/relocated because of the scope. This will cause runtime errors.\r\n\r\nEssentially, now I am not able to find a good way how to activate/deactivate the shading. Only way now I can think of is adding the whole `shade plugin` with all its contents and the `avro` inside the profile.
