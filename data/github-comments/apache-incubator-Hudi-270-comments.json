Thanks for taking the time to file very detailed description.\r\n\r\nFirst of all i believe the crux of the problem is likely lying in the realms of using Bloom Index of the Metadata table: we've recently identified a performance gap in there and @yihua is currently working on addressing that (there's already https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/6432 in progress). \r\n\r\nSecond, i'd recommend you to do following in your evaluation:\r\n\r\n1. Try Hudi 0.12 that has been recently released (we've done a lot of performance benchmarking/optimizations during last release cycle specifically to make sure Hudi's performance is top of the line)\r\n2. Disable `hoodie.bloom.index.use.metadata` for now (until above fix lands)\r\n3. Any particular reason you switching off `hoodie.bloom.index.prune.by.ranges`? It's very crucial aspect of using the Bloom Index that allows to prune the search space considerably for update-heavy workloads only checking the files that could contain the target records (and eliminating ones that couldn't)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1230832162/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1230838319","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/6014#issuecomment-1230838319","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/6014","id":1230838319,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5JXRov","user":{"login":"alexeykudinkin","id":428277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin","html_url":"https://github.com/alexeykudinkin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-29T20:40:17Z","updated_at":"2022-11-07T19:35:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@nsivabalan this doesn't seem to be related to performance, seems more of an issue of some jobs getting stuck.\r\n\r\n@veenaypatil are you able to reliably reproduce this?

But if two writers are writing to two different files, both should succeed (assuming both are concurrent writers). \r\n\r\nFor eg, lets say writer1 ingests 100 records in commit C1. \r\n\r\nand at time t10, wirter1 updates the same 100 records and ingests to hudi. wirter2 updates the same 100 records and ingests to hudi. Hudi may not be in a position to choose the winner. and so will succeed one and will fail the other. In this situations, you will see ConflictResolutionFailed error messages. \r\n\r\nBut lets say writer1 ingests 100 records in commit C1 and writer2 ingests diff set of 100 records to a diff partition in commit C2. \r\n\r\nat time t10, wirter1 updates records as part of C1 and ingests to hudi. writer2 updates the records as part of C2 and ingests to hudi. Both write will succeed if it happens concurrently. bcoz, there is no overlap.\r\n\r\nHope that clarifies why one of the writer failed in your case. you can get some additions details [here](https://hudi.apache.org/docs/concurrency_control).\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1232285154/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1232325579","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/6542#issuecomment-1232325579","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/6542","id":1232325579,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5Jc8vL","user":{"login":"hudi-bot","id":79415918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDE1OTE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79415918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/hudi-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-31T00:55:56Z","updated_at":"2022-08-31T00:55:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\nMeta data\n{\n  \"version\" : 1,\n  \"metaDataEntries\" : [ {\n    \"hash\" : \"93f96405bd8cd6a5486eb0e08e7c08a77214d362\",\n    \"status\" : \"SUCCESS\",\n    \"url\" : \"https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=11035\",\n    \"triggerID\" : \"93f96405bd8cd6a5486eb0e08e7c08a77214d362\",\n    \"triggerType\" : \"PUSH\"\n  } ]\n}-->\n## CI report:\n\n* 93f96405bd8cd6a5486eb0e08e7c08a77214d362 Azure: [SUCCESS](https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=11035) \n\n<details>\n<summary>Bot commands</summary>\n  @hudi-bot supports the following commands:\n\n -
