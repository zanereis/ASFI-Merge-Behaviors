We have been discussing this for a while and this is exactly what we planned for our next generation of engine design. Here are a few general comments:\r\n\r\nCode styles:\r\n - We should put thirdparty dependency on a separate folder from( preferrably thirdparty), so they can be kept in their original form\r\n- Some naming in the code should be changed a bit to conform to google codestyle, specifically use CamelCase for functions, and stl_style for variables.\r\n- We can have a option to switch between spinlock and mutex. I guess they might not be that different\r\n\r\nLogics:\r\nThe real problem of such logic comes when we interleave CPU resource allocation code(which runs early) with the stream execution(which defers to the GPU),\r\n\r\n- We need to be specifically careful about memory deletion\r\n   - If allocator goes back to the global memory pool, it has to be sync in all the streams\r\n   - To make imperative operation easy, we might consider add stream specific memory pool, that does not have impact on sync.\r\n\r\nAbstraction:\r\nIdeally, we should have an abstraction of stream, and callback in a generation way, so that we can adapt to other stream system, besides the GPU stream.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/288800552/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/288813011","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/5541#issuecomment-288813011","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/5541","id":288813011,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4ODgxMzAxMQ==","user":{"login":"piiswrong","id":568948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODk0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong","html_url":"https://github.com/piiswrong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-23T18:12:27Z","updated_at":"2017-03-23T18:12:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"operators are already multi threaded and using all 32 cores","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/288813011/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/288814247","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/5530#issuecomment-288814247","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/5530","id":288814247,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4ODgxNDI0Nw==","user":{"login":"piiswrong","id":568948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODk0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong","html_url":"https://github.com/piiswrong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-23T18:16:40Z","updated_at":"2017-03-23T18:16:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I meant you don't need to add an additional argument to fit to do this.

Unfortuntaly (or fortunately!) I'm getting married in two days and will be out of office for the next month, so it will have to wait a bit. I wanted to get this PR started for comments and evaluation beforehand.\r\n\r\n@piiswrong\r\n>Are you pushing everything to cuda streams as soon as they are pushed to engine? If so are you balancing the load between streams?\r\n\r\nOperations are pushed to CUDA streams as soon as possible if dependencies are met, so if you push a single dependency chain of operations they will be scheduled and pushed immediately on a single stream (if there are streams available, the limit is currently set to 16 concurrent streams). If you then push another chain of operations independent of the first, it too will be scheduled and run on a separate single stream immediately. \r\nIf any chain contains CPU operations, the first GPU part of the chain will be scheduled and pushed to a stream, the stream synchronized, the first dependent CPU operation will then be scheduled and run, the next slice of GPU operations will be scheduled and run, etc.\r\nLoad balancing is mostly deferred to the CUDA driver, scheduling actual kernels as fast as possible from different streams. The idea is to keep as much parallelism as possible so there is always work to do: bestStream() tries to achieve this.\r\n\r\nRegarding spinlocks, I've also tried acquire/release-fence locks that yield instead of spin if busy, resulting in slightly lower performance in benchmarks. In the end I skipped this so to not have to include another lock type in the codebase, but we can of course try this if there are other advantages. The spinning of the spinlocks should be very limited though, as the locking performed is very specific - mostly around individual variables or operations.\r\n\r\n@tqchen\r\n\r\nFor Code Styles, I can surely adjust.\r\n\r\nRegarding resource allocation logic and interleaving CPU / GPU operations I've tried to be conservative. Only GPU operations are scheduled in bulk - other operations sync to all dependencies. It may very well be that I missed something but the engine should otherwise adhere to all expectations of the public engine API. I'm assuming that all resource allocation is scheduled in the engine as well, but my understanding of this part of MXNet is not 100% so maybe we can discuss details when I'm back.\r\n\r\nI agree that a more general stream abstraction would be useful.\r\n\r\nI hope to provide further updates and get the build working after my holidays.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/288835100/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/288837751","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/4720#issuecomment-288837751","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/4720","id":288837751,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4ODgzNzc1MQ==","user":{"login":"zhreshold","id":3307514,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDc1MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3307514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold","html_url":"https://github.com/zhreshold","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-23T19:41:49Z","updated_at":"2017-03-23T19:41:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@demingbh Should have been fixed, plz try again","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/288837751/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/288840938","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/4852#issuecomment-288840938","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/4852","id":288840938,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4ODg0MDkzOA==","user":{"login":"mhall119","id":589188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4OTE4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/589188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhall119","html_url":"https://github.com/mhall119","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhall119/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhall119/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhall119/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhall119/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhall119/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhall119/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhall119/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhall119/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhall119/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-23T19:54:15Z","updated_at":"2017-03-23T19:54:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"build.snapcraft.io will default to building on multiple arches (x86_64, armhf and arm64 I think).

The reason is that, if I understood it correctly, reshape itself doesn't change the layout of the data underneath, so the matrix with the new shape may not be meaningful as you intended.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/289198837/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/289200648","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/4172#issuecomment-289200648","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/4172","id":289200648,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4OTIwMDY0OA==","user":{"login":"ysh329","id":7320657,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMjA2NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7320657?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ysh329","html_url":"https://github.com/ysh329","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ysh329/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ysh329/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ysh329/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ysh329/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ysh329/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ysh329/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ysh329/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ysh329/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ysh329/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-25T09:34:59Z","updated_at":"2017-03-25T09:34:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"You can try solution below:\r\n\r\nIOError of train_mnist.py :( · Issue #4285 · dmlc/mxnet\r\nhttps://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/issues/4285\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/289200648/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/289218567","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/4925#issuecomment-289218567","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/4925","id":289218567,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4OTIxODU2Nw==","user":{"login":"eltrac","id":26674643,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Njc0NjQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26674643?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eltrac","html_url":"https://github.com/eltrac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eltrac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eltrac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eltrac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eltrac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eltrac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eltrac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eltrac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eltrac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eltrac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-25T15:24:39Z","updated_at":"2017-03-25T15:24:39Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Dear all\r\nI have the same pb with the same config.
