I have in my databases dates such as 9999-12-31 (yes, it is on purpose, no it is not an error, no, it cannot be changed =) ) \r\n\r\nthe problem can be easily reproduced as you said in pandas:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> pandas.to_datetime('9999-12-31')\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/data/RWD_SHARE/MDH/APPS/superset_dev/supersetenv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pandas/core/tools/datetimes.py\", line 377, in _convert_listlike\r\n    values, tz = conversion.datetime_to_datetime64(arg)\r\n  File \"pandas/_libs/tslibs/conversion.pyx\", line 188, in pandas._libs.tslibs.conversion.datetime_to_datetime64\r\nTypeError: Unrecognized value type: <class 'str'>\r\n\r\nDuring handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:\r\n\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"/data/RWD_SHARE/MDH/APPS/superset_dev/supersetenv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pandas/core/tools/datetimes.py\", line 469, in to_datetime\r\n    result = _convert_listlike(np.array([arg]), box, format)[0]\r\n  File \"/data/RWD_SHARE/MDH/APPS/superset_dev/supersetenv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pandas/core/tools/datetimes.py\", line 380, in _convert_listlike\r\n    raise e\r\n  File \"/data/RWD_SHARE/MDH/APPS/superset_dev/supersetenv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pandas/core/tools/datetimes.py\", line 368, in _convert_listlike\r\n    require_iso8601=require_iso8601\r\n  File \"pandas/_libs/tslib.pyx\", line 492, in pandas._libs.tslib.array_to_datetime\r\n  File \"pandas/_libs/tslib.pyx\", line 699, in pandas._libs.tslib.array_to_datetime\r\n  File \"pandas/_libs/tslib.pyx\", line 671, in pandas._libs.tslib.array_to_datetime\r\n  File \"pandas/_libs/tslib.pyx\", line 657, in pandas._libs.tslib.array_to_datetime\r\n  File \"pandas/_libs/tslibs/np_datetime.pyx\", line 121, in pandas._libs.tslibs.np_datetime.check_dts_bounds\r\npandas._libs.tslibs.np_datetime.OutOfBoundsDatetime: Out of bounds nanosecond timestamp: 9999-12-31 00:00:00\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe thing is obviously that you cannot convert such a date to datetime64[ns] as that one is defined in nanoseconds. It should remain as datetime.datetime or string or whatever it was originally.\r\n\r\nI did a couple of quick changes on superset dataframe.py that solve it, but I don't know what is the consequence or if there is a better alternative.\r\n\r\nI changed: \r\n\r\n```\r\npd.DataFrame(list(data), columns=self.column_names).infer_objects())\r\n```\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n```\r\npd.DataFrame(list(data), columns=self.column_names)) # .infer_objects())\r\n```\r\n\r\nbecause that infer_objects is trying to convert to datetime64ns.\r\nWhat is the consequence of doing this? Everything looks good in sqlab\r\n\r\nand then I had to do yet another change:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndata = [dict((k, _maybe_box_datetimelike(v))\r\n                for k, v in zip(self.df.columns, np.atleast_1d(row)))\r\n                for row in self.df.values]\r\n``` \r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n```\r\ndata = [dict((k, v)\r\n                for k, v in zip(self.df.columns, np.atleast_1d(row)))\r\n                for row in self.df.values]\r\n```\r\n\r\nbecause that _maybe_box_datetimelike (by the way in pandas 0.24 the underscore is removed, I am working with pandas 0.23 for now) merciless transforms to datetime64ns. \r\n\r\nI think I don't have datetimes with timezone information in my database so I hope it will be good for now ... or are these changes going to bite me very soon?\r\n\r\nsuggestions appreciated.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/459266621/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/459294519","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/6445#issuecomment-459294519","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/6445","id":459294519,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1OTI5NDUxOQ==","user":{"login":"dataedgehungary","id":41633732,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNjMzNzMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41633732?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dataedgehungary","html_url":"https://github.com/dataedgehungary","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dataedgehungary/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dataedgehungary/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dataedgehungary/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dataedgehungary/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dataedgehungary/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dataedgehungary/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dataedgehungary/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dataedgehungary/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dataedgehungary/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-31T10:28:47Z","updated_at":"2019-01-31T12:10:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi, \r\n\r\nI would appreciate some help, I am sure something is missing for me...
