It looks like there are two issues going on. First, in GroupByQueryQueryToolChest.mergeGroupByResult(), the call to makeIncrementalIndex when constructing the IncrementalIndexStorageAdapter is wrong. Instead of passing in the subquery, the query needs to be passed instead. This will include the necessary post-aggregator values correctly. The other problem is that mapping of fields between the inner and outer query is done using aggregators retrieved from AggregatorFactory.getCombiningFactory(), which due to its other uses, assumes that the name of the inner queries fields (aggregators or post-aggs) are the same as the outer query's aggregators that reference them. Effectively, \"fieldName\" in the outer queries aggregators will always be ignored and \"name\" used instead to find the underlying field.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/45365531/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/45394168","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/590#issuecomment-45394168","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/590","id":45394168,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1Mzk0MTY4","user":{"login":"fjy","id":428325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODMyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy","html_url":"https://github.com/fjy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-06-06T23:35:41Z","updated_at":"2014-06-06T23:35:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Integrating

I found log4j.xml within druid/install module.  However after compilation i did not find it being bundled with tar, hence i manually copied the file and included it in classpath of historical node (used historical as example). It did not cause any affect.\n\nIn addition to using dailyrollingfileappender, i found this very useful appender called CustodianDailyRollingFileAppender by Ryan that does the following in addition to DailyRollingFileAppender\n1) compress log files older than today\n2) remove log files older than a specified number of days\n\nthrough two additional settings\n        <param name=\"MaxNumberOfDays\" value=\"14\"/>\n        <param name=\"CompressBackups\" value=\"true\"/>\n\nWill compress log files daily and delete them after 14 days.\n\nI have made the above changes but unable to plug druid/install/log4j.xml into executable.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/46975930/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/47061080","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/619#issuecomment-47061080","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/619","id":47061080,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MDYxMDgw","user":{"login":"fjy","id":428325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODMyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy","html_url":"https://github.com/fjy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-06-25T05:09:05Z","updated_at":"2014-06-25T05:09:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hmm, we did some benchmarks with 10k select and they generally returned < 5s.
