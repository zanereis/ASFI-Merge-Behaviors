But if Spark is a dependency, the install should look for Spark, and fail to install if it is missing.  But I don't think we intend for Spark to be a dependency.)\n\n(If Spark _is_ a Zeppelin dependency, then why do we have a concept that there can be more than one InterpreterGroup?

In my guess, you insist that we treat Spark as \"one of\" the interpreters like Flink, Geode, Hive, Ignite and so on. Thus if a user already doesn't have Spark, Zeppelin should fail to run spark codes, is it correct? If it's correct, the history will help you understand why we treat Spark specially. Zeppelin started with a notebook server of Spark and many users - I believe - use Zeppelin as a Spark notebook. And I also believed this is the main purpose from now. But if some users think the Zeppelin as a general notebook, Spark looks like one of interpreters as you think and it doesn't make sense why Zeppelin include Spark internally. That's the difference between you and me. For the future, I agree Zeppelin become a general notebook. You, however, consider how to guide existing user to install Spark manually, because of the history of Zeppelin. Any good idea will help deal with.

\n\nI think I was not clear.  I do _not_ think we should treat Spark as just like any other interpreter. \n\nI think we should either treat it as just another interpreter, or treat it as special.  We should pick one of those.  We should then commit to that choice fully.  We should not be half-one and half-the-other.\n\n(If we were to vote, I would probably vote for Spark to be \"special.\")\n\nBUT -- either way, whether it is special or not, has no effect on this PR.\n\nWhether Zeppelin is one or the other, either way it should not be trying to install Spark.  Either way, the SparkInterpreter should not try to connect to Spark if SPARK_HOME is not set.  Even if Spark is special, it should not be installed by Zeppelin!\n\nThe use of \"manual Spark\" does not work reliably work.  It breaks the build process consistently.  It produces failures that are very hard to trace.  It breaks whenever a new version of Spark comes out.  I suspect this is also the cause of many CI failures.  \n\nThe installation of Spark by Zeppelin does not reliably work.  It often results in installations that fail because of second-, third-, fourth-degree indirect dependency conflicts.  For example, if you build against 1.5 then run against 1.4, often you will get errors about incompatible versions of akka at runtime. \n\n(Here's something to try -- try setting SPARK_HOME, spark.home, and the Spark build version to be different versions of Spark.  Watch what happens.)\n\n\"Manual spark\" has proven to not be maintainable.  \n\nIn addition:   I have been told that the decision has **already been made** to take-out Spark without SPARK_HOME.  That there is a pending PR _already_ to remove this \"feature.\"\n\nIn that case, this PR is pointless.  It does not matter if SparkInterpreter is special or not. \n\nBut **this** PR would  be a bad idea even if \"manual Spark\" was staying. \n\nif \"manual Spark\" was staying, the correct plan now would be to fix the dependency architecture so we do not have to change 2000 lines of code and break _everything_ whenever a new Spark version comes out. \n\nSo -- no matter what about \"special\" Spark, and no matter about \"manual Spark,\" **this** PR is a bad idea.  \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/162751848/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/162752586","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/520#issuecomment-162752586","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/520","id":162752586,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2Mjc1MjU4Ng==","user":{"login":"felixcheung","id":8969467,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5Njk0Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8969467?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung","html_url":"https://github.com/felixcheung","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-08T04:01:37Z","updated_at":"2015-12-08T04:01:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@jeffsteinmetz has a good point about ES Query DSL.

In fact, you are welcome to create a new PR.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/162790790/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/162796317","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/463#issuecomment-162796317","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/463","id":162796317,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2Mjc5NjMxNw==","user":{"login":"jongyoul","id":3612566,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTI1NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3612566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul","html_url":"https://github.com/jongyoul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-08T07:04:36Z","updated_at":"2015-12-08T07:04:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@elbamos There is my opinion where you classify these issues:\n- Agree. This is a long-term discussion without this PR\n- Partially agree now and fully for the future. If we found the way that those who use Zeppelin for the first time enjoy Spark with Zeppelin without any specific settings, \"Manual Spark\" would be faded out.\n- I don't have any right and privilege to decide anything in this PR technically. It's up to @felixcheung. I only appreciate @felixcheung 's effort for improving Zeppelin.\n\nIn addition to second one, I suggest, at first, we divide manual and SPARK_HOME Spark completely, and provide manual Spark to the first time user only with local mode without any settings for having experience with Zeppelin and Spark. and SPARK_HOME Spark is the main interpreter for production. And time goes, even though the new users don't use manual Spark, we will fade it out. this way is for the beginners and production-level users. We always take care of the beginner to settle in Zeppelin. how about my idea? \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/162796317/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/162797753","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/514#issuecomment-162797753","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/514","id":162797753,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2Mjc5Nzc1Mw==","user":{"login":"Leemoonsoo","id":1540981,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDA5ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1540981?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo","html_url":"https://github.com/Leemoonsoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-08T07:15:59Z","updated_at":"2015-12-08T07:15:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Working really well.

to all for your comments!\n\nAbout the DSL, my goal was not reinvent the wheel, but just provide a simple way to access Elasticsearch.\nI wanted to be closer to the Java API that provides classes such as GetRequest, CountRequest, SearchRequest, DeleteRequest, ...\nSo, I have just reused these concepts.\nThe query you can provide for some commands (search, for example) is exactly what you can provide to Elasticsearch, nothing more, nothing less.\n\nThe main problem is how to handle the json documents returned by Elasticsearch.\nI have decided to flatten the json document.\nIf you have:\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"field1\": \"value1\",\n    \"field2\": {\n        \"field3\":\"value3\",\n        \"field4\":[1,3]\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou will get a something like this:\n\n| field1 | field2.field3 | field2.field4[0] | field2.field4[1] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| value1 | value3 | 1 | 2 |\n\nI will fix the code in this way, are you ok
