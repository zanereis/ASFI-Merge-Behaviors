There's a lot here, so it's not going to make the cut into 1.7, but it looks basically good.\n\nThere's some cosmetic stuff:\n- Rebase and squash into a single commit\n- Make sure all comments are real, not stuff like \"/*\\* */\" to shut up checkstyle.\n- Try to comply with the coding style. Indent 2, continuation indent 4; don't align parameters/arguments with the opening '(', just indent them 4. (E.g. revert the formatting change you made to RelCollationTraitDef.canConvert.)\n- Make sure \"mvn javadoc:javadoc javadoc:test-javadoc\" passes under both jdk 1.7 and 1.8. (It doesn't right now.)\n- Remove '// implement Interface' comments; we don't use them in new code\n- Use \"{@link ...}\" when you reference a class or method in javadoc. It forces us to make references stay up-to-date.\n\nI'm running some exhaustive tests and reviewing the content more thoroughly and should have some more feedback

 I will make the suggested changes.  I did have a question about a test \"JdbTest.testJoinManyWay\".\n\nIt looks like when there are enough joins, this patch slows things down significantly.  In particular, I believe 4 way join is fine, but when I get to 6 way joins, the test seems to run for a long time (I have never finished 6-way join with this patch).  I think, with JoinCommuteRule and this patch together, the planning may become excessively thorough/exhaustive.  For example, if I remove this patch, or make JoinCommuteRule.onMatch() to return before calling transformTo(), the 6-way join returns within 10 seconds or so.\n\nI will be looking into this a little bit, but wanted to see if any of you have suggestions/ideas to fix this issue.  I could file this problem in a separate issue and debug it separately but wanted to make this a known problem before proceeding.\n\nThanks!\nMinji\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/200052195/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/200172997","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/214#issuecomment-200172997","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/214","id":200172997,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwMDE3Mjk5Nw==","user":{"login":"joshelser","id":67863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3ODYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser","html_url":"https://github.com/joshelser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-23T04:44:13Z","updated_at":"2016-03-23T04:44:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Well, JAAS-configuration-file-based login is causing me loads of heartburn on JDK8, and I have no idea why.\n\n```\n    [GSS LoginConfigImpl]: Trying com.sun.security.jgss.krb5.accept: does not exist.\n    [GSS LoginConfigImpl]: Trying com.sun.security.jgss.accept: does not exist.\n    [GSS LoginConfigImpl]: Cannot read JGSS entry, use default values instead.\n    [LoginContext]: login success\n    [LoginContext]: commit success\nFound KeyTab Default keytab\nEntered Krb5Context.acceptSecContext with state=STATE_NEW\nLooking for keys for: HTTP/localhost@EXAMPLE.COM\nLooking for keys for: HTTP/localhost@EXAMPLE.COM\n2016-03-23 00:39:28,813 [qtp841262455-34] WARN  -\nGSSException: Failure unspecified at GSS-API level (Mechanism level: Invalid argument (400) - Cannot find key of appropriate type to decrypt AP REP - AES128 CTS mode with HMAC SHA1-96)\n```\n\nFor some reason, it just does not want to read the entries in the JAAS file, and thus can't find the key for the principal.

If it's from a \"why hsqldb?\": it could be any database like you say. Or, if it from a \"why bundle it?\": the intent was to have a standalone artifact that is always available for a release to run Avatica against. If someone files a bug against 1.8.0 and says a 1.8.0 client doesn't work with a 1.6.0 server, I want to be able to easily launch an instance of Avatica 1.6.0 server without having to worry about the integration with some other system (e.g. Phoenix, Drill, etc).

Judging by the LICENSE file you are including it in the distribution. Why is this necessary?\n\nYes, there is a shaded jar in which HSQLDB is included in. This goes to the 2nd point -- I do not want to make starting a server for testing any harder than it needs to be. Thankfully, HSQLDB is BSD licensed which makes it simple for us to include it and, to the first point, agnostic to the user/dev.\n\n> The TCK is a development-time tool, so you don't need to bundle the binaries that it needs.\n\nIMO, it's necessary because if we make it harder to run, no one will run it. I feel that even now, having to start a server for each version you want to test now is a wart. Having a single JAR file that can be referenced to run a server was an trivial first step to make running this framework easier (lets us punt on bootstrapping all of the necessary servers for the time-being -- long term, I can see a project which fully automates the TCK).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/217919039/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/219882835","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/232#issuecomment-219882835","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/232","id":219882835,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxOTg4MjgzNQ==","user":{"login":"julianhyde","id":1130553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzA1NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1130553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde","html_url":"https://github.com/julianhyde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-17T23:20:38Z","updated_at":"2016-05-17T23:20:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for this.

With the latest changes, each Convention gets to decide whether it wants to handle trait conversions using AbstractConverters (e.g. Collation, Distribution, etc.).  By default, all the Convention returns false to using AbstractConverters.  So, everything should be just as fast as before.  The 6-way join completes within 14 seconds, which is what we were seeing earlier without this change.\n\nI ran all the tests in calcite and they all passed.
