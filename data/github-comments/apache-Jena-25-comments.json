I did look into some of what you mention:\r\n\r\nI started with cherry picking \"JENA-2179...\"[1]; but it still logged warnings when the `TokenizerText.errorHandler` was built by `RDFParserBuilder` (using `ErrorHandlerFactory.getDefaultErrorHandler()`). We could change the factory default error handler, but that is used in a lot of places and is a bit risky at this point.\r\n\r\nAnd elsewhere: although the warnings are ignored, there was no way to configure `NodecSSE` to pass a different `ErrorHandler` to `TokenizerText`. That is not critical to us; just an observation.\r\n\r\nSo: We are already in beta and I am trying to reduce the number and complexity of code changes. I would also like to sidestep the need to find all the places our code might trigger these warnings and verify the resultant behavior. So I took the most direct route of removing all the U+FFFD checks in `TokenizerText`. Of course, we will revisit all this post-release; worst case, when we move to Jena 4.3+.\r\n\r\nAlso, I do not understand the change to the writers to \"escape\" the U+FFFD. That just seems to be a workaround that stops the warnings in subsequent parsing. Which raises the question: Why were these warnings added to the Jena parsers? U+FFFD is a legal Unicode character; so why the warning? It seems like, by the time it is being read, the cat is out of the bag and there is nothing anyone can do to fix the implied problem (improper encoding/decoding). But maybe I am missing the use case(s)?\r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks again for the suggestions.\r\n\r\n[1] [394598d70ff4373b7fd335e79d100d8081af7fb0](https://github.com/apache/jena/commit/394598d70ff4373b7fd335e79d100d8081af7fb0)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/969854870/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/971793260","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/1108#issuecomment-971793260","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/1108","id":971793260,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec457GNs","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-17T17:22:16Z","updated_at":"2021-11-17T17:22:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"`NodecSSE` does not print warnings, only errors and fatal.\r\nWhat other configuration might be used?\r\n\r\n[NodecSSE line 136](https://github.com/apache/jena/commit/394598d70ff4373b7fd335e79d100d8081af7fb0#diff-328894f6474e24eac980398f772f09938cbb2190b06a80c94977caf6d9fc8b2cR136)\r\n\r\nTDB2 is not affected.\r\n\r\n> seems to be a workaround that stops the warnings in subsequent parsing.\r\n\r\nExactly - though it is not a \"workaround\"; it is intentional.

The raw FFFD is _not in the original input_, it is generated by the JDK.\r\nThe input file was not legal syntax. The FFFD is a translation artifact so that it is a\r\nwarning, not a fatal error. \\uFFFD means two cases can be distinguished.\r\n\r\nThe syntax of Turtle allows various bad Unicode string cases (e.g. misused surrogates) and if the input isn't legal UTF-8 then it's not legal because Turtle is defined for UTF-8.

But it should be doable I guess. The new `jena-fuseki-ui` uses Maven to call `yarn build`. The generated resources (HTML, JS, CSS, images) can be used as-is in a separate HTTP server if we wanted. By default they point to URL's like `/$/ping` I think (so if behind a reverse proxy they should work as long as the URL is correct for Fuseki servlets).\r\n\r\nSo as long as the final result includes these generated resources somewhere where Fuseki server can load when expanding the WAR or loading the Jetty application, there's no constraint as how the Maven project is organized.\r\n\r\ni.e. I just need to learn how to achieve what you explained, but should work just fine :crossed_fingers: ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/980801499/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/980801613","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/1115#issuecomment-980801613","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/1115","id":980801613,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec46ddhN","user":{"login":"kinow","id":304786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDc4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/304786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow","html_url":"https://github.com/kinow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-27T22:43:27Z","updated_at":"2021-11-27T22:43:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":">Every time I going to the query tab it seems quite slow (but my machine may not be setup correctly having flipped UI implementations and general have a polluted browser).\r\n\r\nHmmm, just noticed that.

The fontawesome dependencies are bringing a few more transitive dependencies. We could possibly limit the icons used, and import them directly as SVG's, which would possibly reduce the package size. But YASQE/YASGUI/YASR were updated and now require a lot more dependencies than the version used by Fuseki in the past. Finally, Bootstrap Vue also includes a few more dependencies. We could see about depending directly on Bootstrap, instead of Bootstrap Vue, but before that we would have to write some components ourselves.\r\n\r\nSo there's room for improvement regarding the artefact size, if that becomes a problem. But I don't think you have any issues in your environment, I think your analysis is correct :+1: \r\n\r\n>vue / react: I'm not qualified to comment. In large enterprise settings, I almost always see react. In less traditional settings, vue comes up.\r\n>\r\n>And we have a vue implementation here already\r\n\r\nYeah, React is the most famous JS reactive framework, mostly because it was created first. It has more libraries and documentation, but as I was working with Vue, and since Fuseki is a very simple application with few dependencies, I wrote it in Vue to save time.\r\n\r\nAfter we have it merged, my plans are:\r\n\r\n- [ ] write unit and end-to-end tests to cover most basic functionality (formatting a query, submitting a query, clicking on the menu to navigate the site, etc)\r\n- [ ] move the common code (i.e. not specific to vue) to JS or TypeScript code. So that we can always use this code, no matter the framework (I migrated a lot of old JS code that was in the middle of Backbone.js code; now this code is in the middle of some Vue code/components; IMHO moving it into a separate place will make maintenance and future upgrades like this a lot smoother)\r\n- [ ] see which direction we will take, adding more features? breaking it into other webapps like manage/sparqler/etc? improve performance? etc, and then create new JIRA issues for that.\r\n\r\nAfter this, if we need to change to React, Vue 3, or any other framework, it should be a lot easier having the e2e tests, and also the core code separately.\r\n\r\n>Is this for 4.3.0 for Fuseki/webapp?\r\n>Or put it in just after 4.3.0 and ask people to try it out?\r\n>(making a workbench only, query+upload data, is a separate matter for now.)\r\n\r\nUp to you @afs. I think the sooner we give it to users to try it, the better. But I don't fully understand the build and deployment of Fuseki, so cannot say I'm 100% confident I have done a good job packaging it.\r\n\r\n> LICENCE and NOTICE for code\r\n\r\nUh! I forgot about the `LICENSE` file for `jena-fuseki-ui`! Just included one with the Apache License at the top, followed by a separator `- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -`, and the output of `yarn licenses list --prod`. And added a `NOTICE` file with the output of `yarn licenses generate-disclaimer --prod`. I included in comments the commands used to generate the files so we remember to update them when changing the dependencies of the projects.\r\n\r\n> LICENCE and NOTICE for war binary and zip file\r\n\r\nI just had a look at `apache-jena-fuseki` module's assembly configuration. It already includes a `LICENSE` file and a `NOTICE` file. The `LICENSE` file doesn't mention \"bootstrap\" (a dependency we used in the existing Fuseki code), so I did not touch that file. The `NOTICE` file of `apache-jena-fuseki`, though, mentions bootstrap.\r\n\r\nI replaced the section with dependencies that appear to refer to the JS/CSS libraries in the existing Fuseki UI, replacing the the licenses from the `jena-fuseki-ui` module.\r\n\r\n>???\r\n\r\nOnly thing I can remember now that I wanted to mention before, is that this pull request does not delete the old Fuseki files. They are included in the source and distributed code. However, the new Fuseki UI files are copied to the distributed ZIP, and the `index.html` is overwritten, using the new JS/CSS files.\r\n\r\nRebased onto `main`.\r\n\r\nThanks @afs !\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/985999823/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/986275510","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/1115#issuecomment-986275510","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/1115","id":986275510,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec46yV62","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-05T18:11:17Z","updated_at":"2021-12-05T18:11:17Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"If that's the size it is, and my build isn't messed up, that's OK. Getting \"smart\" costs the project in maintaining the smarts. There are bigger download savings to made like distributing the WAR file by link from the download page, not in the zip file.\r\n\r\n4.3.0 is a lot of internal churn for networking changes and reworking things to make local dataset and remote dataset have the same API + using java.net.http, various fixes, retires OSGi formally, not much external features other than xloader.

see if we can move this closer to being merged into main.\r\n\r\nI'd like to leave main untouched for a few more days just in case there are more security issues but Jena as released is on log4j2 2.16.0 now. The latest issue, fixed in 2.17.0, does not affect Jena unless the user changes the logging or has a compromised machine. So good to upgrade Jena's dependency, but from the current information, it is not a reason to do a jena security release. That might be revised - we'll see.\r\n\r\nWith a goal of 4.4.0 with new UI for Fuseki/webapp (war file and fulljar),\r\n\r\n* [x] Rebase branch to current main - there have been POM changes but visually looking at this PR I don't see any conflicts.\r\n* [x] Remove unused. Delete the old UI and any other code. We can get it back from git in the unlikely case we need it.\r\n* [x] Squash the intermediate commits to a few key commits for the long term log record. One commit \"New UI\" would work for me.\r\n\r\nThe change to having no UI in jena-fuseki-webapp will change development a bit (for me - running in a debugger off the codebase directly) but jena-fuseki-webapp isn't changing rapidly and it can be sorted out later after integration into main.\r\n\r\n@kinow Thank for your patience!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/997897891/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/998368175","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/1115#issuecomment-998368175","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/1115","id":998368175,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec47geOv","user":{"login":"kinow","id":304786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDc4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/304786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow","html_url":"https://github.com/kinow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-21T00:25:05Z","updated_at":"2021-12-21T00:25:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@afs I updated your requirements to have a bullet item list on GH, and went through each.

Hardly urgent, more a bit of consistency.\r\n\r\nAh, you mean when you create a new dataset and click on \"create dataset\", to have another \"query\" button? Or is it in the `/#/manage` Manage datasets view, to have a link for \"query\" there? This should take under one minute to do :+1: will include it here once I understand where it should go.\r\n\r\n>I'm wondering if we should have only one persistence choice for new databases - TDB2.

I can't think of a reason to create TDB1 databases when starting from new and I'd rather people prefer TDB2 over TDB1.\r\n\r\nI also cannot think why people would use TDB1. I was reading some old papers the other day, on inference & reasoners... I **think** there was one that used TDB1. But I never used it.\r\n\r\nAnd now that you mentioned, I always went automatically to the in-memory or TDB2 options. But for a new user, that does not want an in-memory dataset, I think they would choose \"Persistent – dataset will persist across Fuseki restart\". No reason for choosing TDB2, unless they know what it means.\r\n\r\nSo +1 to simplify it. If necessary (i.e. if users ask to add it back) maybe we could have an \"advanced\" section, hidden by default, with the type of persistent dataset, allowing TDB1 or TDB2.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1004685130/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1004741986","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/1153#issuecomment-1004741986","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/1153","id":1004741986,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec474yVi","user":{"login":"kinow","id":304786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDc4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/304786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow","html_url":"https://github.com/kinow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-04T11:48:08Z","updated_at":"2022-01-04T11:48:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@afs maybe you are seeing the old table, with borders.

I was using the array index as `:key` in Vue. Vue has the concept of `data` in a component. The `Menu` component will have a `data` section, which belongs to the component (you can pass variables as `props` that are accessible in `this.prop` or `this.data`, anyhoo).\r\n\r\nWhen you want to display multiple items, you do something like\r\n\r\n`<div v-for\"item in someList\" :key=\"item.id\">`.\r\n\r\nBut I used the array index, which is a bad practice. In the end, deleting datasets too quickly could accidentally delete the wrong dataset :disappointed_relieved: :open_mouth: \r\n\r\nBut it's fixed, and I couldn't find any other instance of that. So one possible bug fixed. I thought it would take longer, but since I finished everything in one day, I might still have time this week to start writing some tests to prevent any other possible bugs (inherited from the old code, or introduced by yours truly :)\r\n\r\nBruno","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1008599356/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1008917491","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/1160#issuecomment-1008917491","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/1160","id":1008917491,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec48Itvz","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-10T14:19:23Z","updated_at":"2022-01-10T14:19:23Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thank you!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1008917491/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1009102997","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/1160#issuecomment-1009102997","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/1160","id":1009102997,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec48JbCV","user":{"login":"pauloaug","id":804447,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNDQ0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/804447?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pauloaug","html_url":"https://github.com/pauloaug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pauloaug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pauloaug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pauloaug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pauloaug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pauloaug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pauloaug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pauloaug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pauloaug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pauloaug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-10T16:46:26Z","updated_at":"2022-01-10T16:46:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you all for maintaining Jena.
