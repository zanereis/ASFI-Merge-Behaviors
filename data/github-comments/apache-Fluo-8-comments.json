thanks taking this issue on!  Great work so far. Below are some more notes from my review:\n- `distributionManagment` should no longer be configured to publish to Sonatype.  This might be able to just be removed if this is configured in the Apache parent and is inherited.\n- The organization section could be updated to be the ASF:\n\n```\n  <organization>\n    <name>The Apache Software Foundation</name>\n    <url>https://www.apache.org</url>\n  </organization>\n```\n- I think the developers section could be removed\n- The `mailingLists` section could be updated using info on [this page](http://incubator.apache.org/projects/fluo.html)\n- The `scm` section should be updated to something like below (i set tag as `fluo-parent` but I could be wrong):\n\n```\n  <scm>\n    <connection>scm:git:https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-fluo.git</connection>\n    <developerConnection>scm:git:https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-fluo.git</developerConnection>\n    <tag>fluo-parent</tag>\n    <url>https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=incubator-fluo.git</url>\n  </scm>\n```\n- The `url` in `issueManagement` could be updated to `https://github.com/apache/incubator-fluo/issues`\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/230491204/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/230493684","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fluo/pull/697#issuecomment-230493684","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/697","id":230493684,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMDQ5MzY4NA==","user":{"login":"mikewalch","id":730698,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMDY5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/730698?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch","html_url":"https://github.com/mikewalch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-05T14:26:45Z","updated_at":"2016-07-05T14:26:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Are any changes to the Type Layer critical?

Essentially, as long as you are only bundling logback in binary form, you're fine. We may not copy logback source into Fluo.\n\nThe rest of these also look fine (BSD and MIT are compatible). It's also worth mentioning that if Fluo only creates a source release, we don't need to do anything else for the first release (L&N don't need anything additions). Only if Fluo also wants to ship some extra artifacts in addition to the required source release do we get into maintaining multiple versions of L&N.

But I was not thinking it should be in the pom.  Can use it like\n\n```\nmvn dependency:analyze -DoutputXML=true\n```\n\nFor `failOnWarning` , does it cause the build to fail if you comment out one of the `ignoredDependency`? My hope is that it will fail the build if we add a new dependency in code without adding it to the pom.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/232654588/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/232660026","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fluo/pull/704#issuecomment-232660026","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/704","id":232660026,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMjY2MDAyNg==","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-14T13:07:23Z","updated_at":"2016-07-14T13:07:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Removing dependency from cluster module fluo-minithrows exception project fluo-cluster: Unable to start MiniAccumuloCluster: Initialize process returned 1\n\nOh, I think I know whats going on there.

In addition to removing the `fluo-mini` and  `fluo-integration` can you also try removing the profile with id `<id>mini-accumulo</id>`?
