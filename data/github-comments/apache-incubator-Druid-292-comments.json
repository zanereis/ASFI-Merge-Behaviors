The only existing doc I could find where this concept is touched upon is https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/development/extensions-core/kafka-ingestion.html#resetting-supervisors (and equivalent section in the Kinesis page). \r\n\r\nThat section can throttle up the fear factor a bit, but it would be good to put the explanation in docs that are set in the context of UI doc (rather than this operation endpoint doc linked). This would be a larger effort though, I as don't see an existing logical spot for that doc. Something for me to work on. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, taking a stab at how to reword the existing section to induce more fear, for one thing, by moving possible ill effects up :\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe `POST /druid/indexer/v1/supervisor/<supervisorId>/reset` operation clears stored \r\noffsets, causing the supervisor to start reading offsets from either the earliest or latest \r\noffsets in Kafka (depending on the value of useEarliestOffset). After clearing stored \r\noffsets, the supervisor kills and recreates any active tasks, so that tasks begin reading \r\nfrom valid offsets. \r\n\r\nUse care when using this operation! Resetting the supervisor may cause Kafka messages \r\nto be skipped or read twice, resulting in missing or duplicate data. \r\n\r\nThe reason for using this operation is to recover from a state in which the supervisor \r\nceases operating due to missing offsets. The indexing service keeps track of the latest \r\npersisted Kafka offsets in order to provide exactly-once ingestion guarantees across \r\ntasks. Subsequent tasks must start reading from where the previous task completed in \r\norder for the generated segments to be accepted. If the messages at the expected \r\nstarting offsets are no longer available in Kafka (typically because the message retention \r\nperiod has elapsed or the topic was removed and re-created) the supervisor will refuse \r\nto start and in flight tasks will fail.\r\n\r\nThis operation enables you to recover from this condition. Note that the supervisor \r\nmust be running for this endpoint to be available.\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Change applies to https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/docs/development/extensions-core/kafka-ingestion.md)\r\n\r\nLet me know if my rewrite is accurate (and addresses the goal). If so, I’ll file a doc ticket/PR (or add it to this one?)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/578983511/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/579009125","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/9251#issuecomment-579009125","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/9251","id":579009125,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3OTAwOTEyNQ==","user":{"login":"clintropolis","id":1577461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzc0NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1577461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis","html_url":"https://github.com/clintropolis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-27T23:40:36Z","updated_at":"2020-01-27T23:40:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":">Another comment: did you consider removing the default impl of applyNull from the DruidXPredicate interfaces?

For explicit extrationFn usage , it is not a problem because TopN uses different algorithm for that specific case which is what I meant by extractionFns being handled specially everywhere.\r\n\r\nrelaxing the ordering requirement and adding  `DimensionSelector#isDictionarySorted` sounds good to me if/when we need it.

A druid cluster can have only one deep storage, but it should be able to read from different input sources which means people need to choose and load multiple extensions based on where they want to ingest from. I'm not sure what's the disadvantage of having such a consolidated input source extension though except the compatibility when they upgrade their cluster.\r\n\r\nThe advantage is just dependency hygiene, I guess. It's nice to not load the entire world if you aren't going to use it (some of these input sources pull in big sets of dependencies, like hdfs). But the advantage is it would be easier to use (no need to choose which extensions to load).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/580844275/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/580863140","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/9299#issuecomment-580863140","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/9299","id":580863140,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MDg2MzE0MA==","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-31T18:53:13Z","updated_at":"2020-01-31T18:53:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi, would you double check the parseSpec is at the right level?

For example, `Memory.equalTo` at a 32-bit key size is 3x faster than `BB.equals` according to MemoryBenchmark. `Memory.copyTo` is another example.\r\n\r\nSome of the increase is from things that would have been possible to do with BB as well. The key-length-specific hashing and equality code could have been implemented on top of BB. So could the power-of-two optimizations. This actually could get a BB implementation pretty close to a Memory based implementation, but it wouldn't get all of the way there.\r\n\r\nEven so another justification for using Memory is that IMO the Memory API is better than the ByteBuffer API for the kind of stuff we do. There isn't this position / limit stuff that tends to get in our way. And it doesn't continually reset the byte order to big-endian whenever you duplicate or slice it. The JEP 370 stuff will probably be an even better fit, but it will be a while before we can count on all of our users to have it.\r\n\r\nFor these two reasons (Memory does have a couple of APIs that beat BB, and Memory is a nicer API) I thought going with Memory was a good idea.\r\n\r\nBtw, Memory still does do bound checks when you enter its code, but once it does them, it uses Unsafe internally.

Please see https://druid.apache.org/docs/0.17.0/development/extensions-core/druid-basic-security.html for details.\r\n\r\nAs this is the first release with LDAP support, and there are a large variety of LDAP ecosystems, some LDAP use cases and features may not be supported yet.
