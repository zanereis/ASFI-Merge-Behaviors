We could just have server A invoke this operation on server B for a key we know B does not have. It seems like it should be possible to do the same for the region too by sending the message with a region name that does not exist on B. In both cases without the fix should hang the calling thread on A. You can unstick it in the test, if necessary, by invoking `thread.interrupt()` followed by `LockSupport.unpark`.

I don't think this is available.\r\n\r\nThanks for the explanation!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/870720199/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/870766339","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/6658#issuecomment-870766339","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/6658","id":870766339,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3MDc2NjMzOQ==","user":{"login":"onichols-pivotal","id":34043438,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDQzNDM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34043438?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/onichols-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-29T17:02:57Z","updated_at":"2021-06-29T17:02:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"please include the GEODE ticket in the commit message next time","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/870766339/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/870881234","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/6662#issuecomment-870881234","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/6662","id":870881234,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3MDg4MTIzNA==","user":{"login":"lgtm-com[bot]","id":43144390,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDMxNDQzOTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/17324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/lgtm-com","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-29T20:08:30Z","updated_at":"2021-06-29T20:08:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This pull request **fixes 1 alert** when merging f6363aba8a4f087904e14e884d0faff9aa7eb0ab into 5a75bf1a2420e3395c7bb31191d908a30d526c8d -

As the new change is doing.\r\n\r\nTagging the last transaction event is needed by `SerialGatewaySenderQueue` and `ParallelGatewaySenderQueue` to make sure that, when group-transaction-events is enabled, batches do not contain incomplete transactions. The way to assure that is to check that for every transaction in the batch (events are tagged with the transaction event), there is an event for that transaction that is the last event in the transaction (there is an event tagged as last transaction event).\r\nI do not see why your changes avoid the need for tagging the last transaction event.\r\n\r\nSecondly, having events for a transaction that will not be replicated by all senders (when some of the senders have group-transaction-events set to true) could POSSIBLY be a configuration error.\r\nLet me illustrate it with an example:\r\nLet's suppose that we have a system with two senders, sender1 and sender2, both with group-transaction-events set to true.\r\nNow let's suppose that a transaction (t1) arrives to Geode with two events: event1 (create a) and event2 (create b).\r\nLet's suppose that event1 is to be replicated by sender1 (but not sender2) and event 2 is to be replicated by sender2 (but not sender1).\r\nThe last event for the transaction will be event2 and it will be tagged as such.\r\nWhat we will see happening is that even1 arrives to sender1's queue. When event1 is added to a batch and the batch is to be sent, it will be checked if all events for the transaction to which even1 belongs (t1) are in the batch. As there is only one event and it is not the last event in the the transaction, the batch creator will try to get the missing events for the transaction but it will never get them because they will never arrive, the last event in the transaction will not be on the sender1 queue but it will be on the sender2 queue.\r\nAt the same time, event2 will arrive to sender2's queue. When this event is added to a batch and the batch is to be sent, it will be checked if all transactions are complete. For t1, as we have the last event for the transaction (event2), it will be considered that it is so. Nevertheless, as not all events for the transaction are sent to this sender, the assumption would be wrong.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/872768866/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/872783056","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/6601#issuecomment-872783056","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/6601","id":872783056,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3Mjc4MzA1Ng==","user":{"login":"albertogpz","id":26227887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjI3ODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26227887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz","html_url":"https://github.com/albertogpz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-02T07:27:18Z","updated_at":"2021-07-02T07:27:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> I also ran this test:\r\n> \r\n> 2 servers on site1\r\n> 1 server on site2\r\n> Partitioned region with parallel sender\r\n> 1,000,000 entries\r\n> Wan copy from site1 to site2\r\n> \r\n> I see the correct behavior:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> Member | Status | Message\r\n> ------ | ------ | -----------------------\r\n> ln-2   | OK     | Entries copied: 504,400\r\n> ln-1   | OK     | Entries copied: 495,600\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> If I redo the test and kill one of the site1 servers while the copy is happening, I see:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> Member | Status | Message\r\n> ------ | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n> ln-1   | ERROR  | Execution failed.

In any case, it is different usecase but is not an error. Application have their own requirement of sending/managing data in different sites.\r\n\r\nI mean both.

Why do this? because if not all events in the transaction go to the same senders (misconfiguration), that would imply that some senders will not get all the events for the transaction but could try if group-transaction-events is set to complete the transaction in the batch, by looking for the last event in the transaction which could never come (delaying the batch sending) or may come but not guaranteeing that the rest of the events for the transaction were sent in the batch (because they may not have reached the sender).\r\n> > > > > The first check of `getLastTransactionEvent()` was added in order to avoid the cost of the second check if no sender had group-transaction-events set to true.

The way to assure that is to check that for every transaction in the batch (events are tagged with the transaction event), there is an event for that transaction that is the last event in the transaction (there is an event tagged as last transaction event).\r\n> > > I do not see why your changes avoid the need for tagging the last transaction event.\r\n> > \r\n> > \r\n> > Thinking more about this, I see what you are saying...\r\n> > The other option could have been, separating WAN callback and creating a single event/message for all the entries in transaction.

When event1 is added to a batch and the batch is to be sent, it will be checked if all events for the transaction to which even1 belongs (t1) are in the batch. As there is only one event and it is not the last event in the the transaction, the batch creator will try to get the missing events for the transaction but it will never get them because they will never arrive, the last event in the transaction will not be on the sender1 queue but it will be on the sender2 queue.\r\n> > > At the same time, event2 will arrive to sender2's queue. When this event is added to a batch and the batch is to be sent, it will be checked if all transactions are complete. For t1, as we have the last event for the transaction (event2), it will be considered that it is so. Nevertheless, as not all events for the transaction are sent to this sender, the assumption would be wrong.\r\n> > \r\n> > \r\n> > I understand why the lastTransactionEvent; but I don't see how its a configuration error...When you say configuration error, are you meaning sender configuration or setting grouping configuration for a sender. In any case, it is different usecase but is not an error. Application have their own requirement of sending/managing data in different sites.\r\n> \r\n> I mean both. This is what the documentation says about this feature:\r\n> \r\n> _In order to use transaction event grouping:\r\n> \r\n> * The `group-transaction-events` setting is supported only on serial senders with just one dispatcher thread, or on parallel senders.\r\n> * The regions to which the transaction events belong must be replicated by the same set of gateway senders that also have this setting enabled.\r\n> * This setting cannot be enabled if `enable-batch-conflation` is in effect._\r\n> \r\n> The first and the third conditions can be (and are) checked at configuration time.\r\n> But the second condition can only be checked at run time, when a transaction is received. If you have a transaction with several events that spans several regions, and the gateway senders for the regions are not the same, then group-transaction-events will not work even though whoever configured the gateway senders may think it will. Some senders will receive some events for the transaction and other senders will receive other events.\r\n\r\nYes...Thats up to application/use-case, how and what kind data it wants to be sent to other site. The WAN gateway senders \r\ndoesn't have any limitations like that...\r\n\r\n> One may argue that this is not necessarily a configuration error but the fact is that, in this case, a transaction replicated by gateway senders who have group-transaction-events set to true will not be sent in the same batch because senders will not receive all the events for the transaction.\r\n\r\nThe grouping of transaction is some-way of making sure the transaction can be sent as a single group; but it should not be limiting factor (saying error). If it is a limiting factor, the TX should have been rolled back and an exception is thrown to application. Right now what I can see is nothing is rolled back or TX is aborted because of error, it is only logged as message; which is noticed after the event/error has already happened. \r\n\r\n@albertogpz you also mentioned \"This is what the documentation says about this feature:\"; I believe this is not release feature and is not yet documented in Geode manuals; if this needs to be documented we need to create a jira ticket and tag docs team @davebarnes97\r\n\r\nAlso, reading over the code, I see many of the methods in TXLastEventInTransactionUtils.class doesn't have unit level tests. We were wondering what happens with the helper methods in this class, when there are no senders configured, when there are multiple enders on each region with and without grouping option. It will really help Geode product having all the unit test cases covered; do you think you can add additional tests...\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/875139889/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/875749643","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/6674#issuecomment-875749643","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/6674","id":875749643,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3NTc0OTY0Mw==","user":{"login":"DonalEvans","id":17314657,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzE0NjU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17314657?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans","html_url":"https://github.com/DonalEvans","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-07T16:29:34Z","updated_at":"2021-07-07T16:29:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Force pushed to rebase on develop, but also included a change that was not in the initial commit, changing the return type of internal zrank and zrevrank methods to be `long` rather than `int`, as per [the Redis documentation](https://redis.io/topics/protocol#integer-reply) regarding Integer returns: \"the returned integer is guaranteed to be in the range of a signed 64 bit integer\"","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/875749643/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/875865663","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/6676#issuecomment-875865663","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/6676","id":875865663,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3NTg2NTY2Mw==","user":{"login":"sabbey37","id":41928668,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxOTI4NjY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41928668?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sabbey37","html_url":"https://github.com/sabbey37","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sabbey37/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sabbey37/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sabbey37/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sabbey37/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sabbey37/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sabbey37/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sabbey37/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sabbey37/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sabbey37/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-07T19:17:45Z","updated_at":"2021-07-07T19:31:11Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"There was [a change](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/f488fb08f8204126da79fd9d333c04d1ad936567#diff-7a7bd66ef966a17eca71b8f32e9bf763cb7f5ea7d45fad121453011f3824f412R1417) between Tomcat versions 8.5.66 and 8.5.67 as well as between 9.0.20 and 9.0.21 that resulted in an NPE being throw in `setAttribute`.

Why do this? because if not all events in the transaction go to the same senders (misconfiguration), that would imply that some senders will not get all the events for the transaction but could try if group-transaction-events is set to complete the transaction in the batch, by looking for the last event in the transaction which could never come (delaying the batch sending) or may come but not guaranteeing that the rest of the events for the transaction were sent in the batch (because they may not have reached the sender).\r\n> > > > > > The first check of `getLastTransactionEvent()` was added in order to avoid the cost of the second check if no sender had group-transaction-events set to true. In that case, it is irrelevant to return the last transaction event or null because it will not be used although, it could make more sense to return the last transaction event.\r\n> > > > > \r\n> > > > > \r\n> > > > > It looks like the GEODE-7971 tried to use grouping with the existing way of \"invokeTXCallbacks()\", where client, wan, cache-listener notification are done one event from transaction at a time.

The way to assure that is to check that for every transaction in the batch (events are tagged with the transaction event), there is an event for that transaction that is the last event in the transaction (there is an event tagged as last transaction event).\r\n> > > > I do not see why your changes avoid the need for tagging the last transaction event.\r\n> > > \r\n> > > \r\n> > > Thinking more about this, I see what you are saying...\r\n> > > The other option could have been, separating WAN callback and creating a single event/message for all the entries in transaction.

When event1 is added to a batch and the batch is to be sent, it will be checked if all events for the transaction to which even1 belongs (t1) are in the batch. As there is only one event and it is not the last event in the the transaction, the batch creator will try to get the missing events for the transaction but it will never get them because they will never arrive, the last event in the transaction will not be on the sender1 queue but it will be on the sender2 queue.\r\n> > > > At the same time, event2 will arrive to sender2's queue. When this event is added to a batch and the batch is to be sent, it will be checked if all transactions are complete. For t1, as we have the last event for the transaction (event2), it will be considered that it is so. Nevertheless, as not all events for the transaction are sent to this sender, the assumption would be wrong.\r\n> > > \r\n> > > \r\n> > > I understand why the lastTransactionEvent; but I don't see how its a configuration error...When you say configuration error, are you meaning sender configuration or setting grouping configuration for a sender. In any case, it is different usecase but is not an error. Application have their own requirement of sending/managing data in different sites.\r\n> > \r\n> > \r\n> > I mean both. This is what the documentation says about this feature:\r\n> > _In order to use transaction event grouping:\r\n> > \r\n> > * The `group-transaction-events` setting is supported only on serial senders with just one dispatcher thread, or on parallel senders.\r\n> > * The regions to which the transaction events belong must be replicated by the same set of gateway senders that also have this setting enabled.\r\n> > * This setting cannot be enabled if `enable-batch-conflation` is in effect._\r\n> > \r\n> > The first and the third conditions can be (and are) checked at configuration time.\r\n> > But the second condition can only be checked at run time, when a transaction is received. If you have a transaction with several events that spans several regions, and the gateway senders for the regions are not the same, then group-transaction-events will not work even though whoever configured the gateway senders may think it will. Some senders will receive some events for the transaction and other senders will receive other events.\r\n> \r\n> Yes...Thats up to application/use-case, how and what kind data it wants to be sent to other site.

If it is a limiting factor, the TX should have been rolled back and an exception is thrown to application. Right now what I can see is nothing is rolled back or TX is aborted because of error, it is only logged as message; which is noticed after the event/error has already happened.\r\nYou are right. It is not a limiting factor. But if you have configured group-transaction-events for some or all your senders and you have events in transactions being sent by those senders that cannot be grouped then chances are that you might have made a mistake during the configuration. As this cannot be detected at configuration time and it is not necessarily a configuration error, you do not want to rollback the transaction. But at least, you will have a log telling you that transactions are not being grouped so that you can check if there is a configuration error.\r\n\r\n\r\n> \r\n> @albertogpz you also mentioned \"This is what the documentation says about this feature:\"; I believe this is not release feature and is not yet documented in Geode manuals; if this needs to be documented we need to create a jira ticket and tag docs team @davebarnes97\r\n\r\nThis is documented in: geode-docs/topologies_and_comm/topology_concepts/multisite_overview.html.md.erb\r\n\r\n> \r\n> Also, reading over the code, I see many of the methods in TXLastEventInTransactionUtils.class doesn't have unit level tests.

It will really help Geode product having all the unit test cases covered; do you think you can add additional tests...\r\n\r\nTests could also be added to the non-public methods of `TXLastEventInTransactionUtils` in `TXLastEventInTransactionUtilsTest` but the current tests on the public 'getLastTransactionEvent()` method seemed enough to me when I wrote them to cover the cases you mention.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/876191044/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
