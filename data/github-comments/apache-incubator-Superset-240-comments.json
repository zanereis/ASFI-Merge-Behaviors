thanks for the PR! We recently bumped pandas to `>=0.24.2` (see #7852 and #6837 for context), and usually try to keep dependencies as fresh as possible. In this case, while it would be possible to support `<0.24` with the code changes suggested in this PR, given that Superset is not a library but rather an application that is usually run in a venv, there isn't much need to support older versions of dependencies. Unless there is some problem with `0.24`, I would prefer to drop support for `0.23` to keep the codebase as slim as possible.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/512507748/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/512529037","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/7504#issuecomment-512529037","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/7504","id":512529037,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMjUyOTAzNw==","user":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-17T19:09:35Z","updated_at":"2019-07-17T19:09:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had recent activity.
