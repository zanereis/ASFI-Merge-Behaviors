would replace `Delegate` and is much simpler. I placed it in the Java API package but it would not be visible to users through the `DataSet` API.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to implicitly reuse operations performing the same computation on the same input `DataSet`. The optimizer cannot do this without understanding the UDF configuration and logic. Two instances of a UDF may be\n- incompatible, in which case a new result must be computed\n- the same, in which case the old result can be reused\n- different but compatible, in which case the UDF can merge the configurations and the new, shared result replaces the old result\n\nReplacing the old result requires a wrapper.

Thanks for your feedback and here is my response to some of your comments.\n- Do we need to run all the Yarn tests normally and secured? We already have problems with our test execution time. Perhaps we could have one dedicated test for secure setups and disable the other ones by default to run them manually if needed.\n  [Vijay] - Yes, it is not essential to run the secure test case all the time as it consumes more cycles. Do you have any suggestion on controlling this through some mvn/surefire plugin configuration?\n- The testing code seems overly complicated using the custom JUnit Runner. I think we could achieve the same with @BeforeClass and @AfterClass methods in the secure IT cases.\n  [Vijay] - It is little overhead but works out well with minimal changes to the code. We could revisit and make any changes if it creates any issues.\n- There is no dedicated test for the SecurityContext and the JaasConfiguration classes\n  [Vijay] - Yes, will add UT for those classes.\n- It would be nice to add some documentation to the configuration web page.\n  [Vijay] - I believe you are referring to the https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-master/setup/config.html. If so, yes it certainly helps and I will be happy to add the details but I don't have access to edit the page.\n- We should throw exceptions if the secure configuration is not complete instead of falling back to non-authenticated execution for either Hadoop or the Jaas configuration. Otherwise, users might end up with a partly secure environment.\n  [Vijay] - Yes, will add the validation logic\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/236672194/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/236698083","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2323#issuecomment-236698083","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2323","id":236698083,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNjY5ODA4Mw==","user":{"login":"mushketyk","id":592286,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MjI4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/592286?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk","html_url":"https://github.com/mushketyk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-01T20:30:56Z","updated_at":"2016-08-01T20:30:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Set maximum limit for the toString result, as suggested by Stephan here: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-2090 \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/236698083/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/236835907","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2320#issuecomment-236835907","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2320","id":236835907,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNjgzNTkwNw==","user":{"login":"mxm","id":837221,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNzIyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/837221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm","html_url":"https://github.com/mxm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-02T08:17:45Z","updated_at":"2016-08-02T08:17:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Should be good to go now.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/236835907/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/236845777","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2317#issuecomment-236845777","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2317","id":236845777,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNjg0NTc3Nw==","user":{"login":"mxm","id":837221,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNzIyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/837221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm","html_url":"https://github.com/mxm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-02T09:00:33Z","updated_at":"2016-08-02T09:00:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @nielsbasjes.

Do you have any suggestion on controlling this through some mvn/surefire plugin configuration?\n\nI would suggest that we keep three integration test classes for testing security:\n1. Kafka (with Zookeeper)\n2. HDFS\n3. Yarn\n\nIn addition, we need a unit test to verify that the security context is correctly set up. I think we're covered then and don't need any more tests. After all, tests that are disabled by default and we almost never run are not very useful.\n\n> It is little overhead but works out well with minimal changes to the code. We could revisit and make any changes if it creates any issues.\n\nI would really like to move all security testing code to a utility class and call this code through `@AfterClass` and `@BeforeClass` methods. If that is fine with you. This is simpler and easier to understand than the custom runner implementation.\n\n> I believe you are referring to the https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-master/setup/config.html. If so, yes it certainly helps and I will be happy to add the details but I don't have access to edit the page.\n\nYou can actually change this page in the repository at [/docs/setup/config.md](/apache/flink/blob/master/docs/setup/config.md).\n\nConcerning `SASL_PLAINTEXT`: I suppose we're making an effort to encrypt the authentication channel in the changes according to the security document?

it's great to see that someone is working on this stuff!\n\nI just wanted to put in my two cents, to provide a different perspective that might change how you are thinking about this.\n\nOn my project, we are interested in incorporating pre-computed historical time-series data into the values within a time window. Those values would need to be loaded from a distributed database such as Cassandra or DynamoDB. Also, we would like for newly computed time-series data points (produced by a Flink window pane) to be persisted externally, side-by-side with the historical data (in Cassandra/DynamoDB).\n\nIn contrast with your approach, which enables querying of state from within Flink, we are more interested in querying that state from the external database. This allows the Flink job to produce time series data which can be queried ad-hoc in the database, while also allowing the Flink job to produce pre-calculated aggregates from that time series.\n\nI believe others have mentioned in this thread the need, therefore, to allow the State Store to choose the serialization approach. While serializing to byte[] works well for Memory and RocksDB State Stores, inserting into a NoSQL database requires creation of an INSERT command with data that includes primary/partition key, secondary/range key, and arbitrarily structured data (one column of byte[], or multiple columns based on the particular type of value). In particular, we need the timestamp of the time series point to be a top-level value in the INSERT, so that time range queries can be efficient. The interface is also important when it comes to Flink loading pre-existing data, because Flink or an integration layer will need to know how to query for the particular keys it is looking for.\n\nI hope that makes sense & gives some perspective on what some people are thinking about with regard to \"queryable state\".\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/236989636/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/237002407","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2109#issuecomment-237002407","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2109","id":237002407,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNzAwMjQwNw==","user":{"login":"mushketyk","id":592286,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MjI4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/592286?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk","html_url":"https://github.com/mushketyk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-02T18:45:01Z","updated_at":"2016-08-02T18:45:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mxm Thank you for your detailed review!

Please take a look when you get a chance. \n\nRegarding the secure test cases, \n-  HDFS and Yarn are handled through the @BeforeClass and @AfterClass style and they do not use custom JRunner implementation. As you have suggested, I could keep just one or two tests for each of the modules to cut down the running time, if that's okay with you?\n- Kafka tests are handled with custom JRunner and if we need to move it to @BeforeClass and @AfterClass, then we may have to duplicate the code used in the base classes which may not look good. For e.g., Have a look at Kafka09ProducerSecuredITCase which is extended from Kafka09ProducerITCase which has 2 level of parent classes (KafkaProducerTestBase & KafkaTestBase). If we write a separate test case for secure cluster, then I may have to duplicate some of these base class code which can be avoided if we use custom JRunner. We could still limit the number of test cases to just one or two to minimize the running time.
