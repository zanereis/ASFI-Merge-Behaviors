https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1814 separates model from algorithm.\n2) It is just an idea such that a feature transformer doesn't need to worry about other data in the instance.\n3) It won't work because both transform methods have the same type signature. This is also related to 2). We want to apply the filter on the vector and we don't care other data, labeled or not. I'm now working on the API design to make feature transformation easier.
