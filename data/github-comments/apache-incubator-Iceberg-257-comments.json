People won't directly use the Python code, nor I would expect a Java/Javascript version of it. It is more for the developer to see the impact on the code when making changes to the yaml. I think having everything in the same folder makes things simpler (otherwise I'd be inclined to add another `README.md` to the `open-api/` dir). I think adding the directory doesn't add much value other than adding more complexity to the directory structure.

People won't directly use the Python code, nor I would expect a Java/Javascript version of it. It is more for the developer to see the impact on the code when making changes to the yaml. I think having everything in the same folder makes things simpler (otherwise I'd be inclined to add another `README.md` to the `open-api/` dir). I think adding the directory doesn't add much value other than adding more complexity to the directory structure. WDYT?\n\nI see, thanks for the explanation. For those generated code, do we want every change in spec to kick off the python generation and include such in PR or do you plan to add some sort of git action to apply it automatically?

Small changes can have a significant impact on the code itself.\r\n\r\nLet's take https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/7710#discussion_r1216646858\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n    ReportMetricsRequest:\r\n      anyOf:\r\n        - $ref: '#/components/schemas/ScanReport'\r\n        - $ref: '#/components/schemas/CommitReport'\r\n      required:\r\n        - report-type\r\n      properties:\r\n        report-type:\r\n          type: string\r\n```\r\n\r\nAbove is the the current code on master, and that generates:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass ReportMetricsRequest(ScanReport):\r\n    report_type: str = Field(..., alias='report-type')\r\n\r\n\r\nclass ReportMetricsRequest1(CommitReport):\r\n    report_type: str = Field(..., alias='report-type')\r\n\r\n\r\nclass ReportMetricsRequest2(BaseModel):\r\n    __root__: Union[ReportMetricsRequest, ReportMetricsRequest1]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThis looks weird, and it is. `ReportMetricsRequest` is `anyOf` (validates the value against any (one or more) of the subschemas) of both `ScanReport` and `CommitReport`. It is actually the other way around. `ScanReport` and `CommitReport` is `allOf` `ReportMetricsRequest`. And based on the `report-type` it is `oneOf` the subtypes based on the `report-type`:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n    ReportMetricsRequest:\r\n      type: object\r\n      discriminator:\r\n        propertyName: report-type\r\n        mapping:\r\n          commit-report: '#/components/schemas/CommitReport'\r\n          scan-report: '#/components/schemas/ScanReport'\r\n      required:\r\n        - report-type\r\n      properties:\r\n        report-type:\r\n          type: string\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe point that I'm trying to make here is that is very easy to get confused in the `allOf`, `anyOf`, and `oneOf`. And for me, it really helps to see the code alongside the PR. The idea is that we keep the Python code up to sync, and when you update the open-api code, you'll see the impact on the code. If you do it the other way around, you'll end up with:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass ReportMetricsRequest(BaseModel):\r\n    report_type: str = Field(..., alias='report-type')\r\n\r\n\r\nclass CommitReport(ReportMetricsRequest):\r\n    report_type: Literal['commit-report'] = Field(..., alias='report-type')\r\n    table_name: str = Field(..., alias='table-name')\r\n    snapshot_id: int = Field(..., alias='snapshot-id')\r\n    sequence_number: int = Field(..., alias='sequence-number')\r\n    operation: str\r\n    metrics: Metrics\r\n    metadata: Optional[Dict[str, str]] = None\r\n\r\n\r\nclass ScanReport(ReportMetricsRequest):\r\n    report_type: Literal['scan-report'] = Field(..., alias='report-type')\r\n    table_name: str = Field(..., alias='table-name')\r\n    snapshot_id: int = Field(..., alias='snapshot-id')\r\n    filter: Expression\r\n    schema_id: int = Field(..., alias='schema-id')\r\n    projected_field_ids: List[int] = Field(..., alias='projected-field-ids')\r\n    projected_field_names: List[str] = Field(..., alias='projected-field-names')\r\n    metrics: Metrics\r\n    metadata: Optional[Dict[str, str]] = None\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we want to generate clients in other languages as well, it helps to keep the open-API as close to the supposed implementation as possible.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1577410577/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1577523848","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/7445#issuecomment-1577523848","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/7445","id":1577523848,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85eBxqI","user":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-05T21:54:32Z","updated_at":"2023-06-05T21:54:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @nastra, @dramaticlly, @singhpk234 and @rdblue for the review! 🙌🏻 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1577523848/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1577525308","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/6701#issuecomment-1577525308","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/6701","id":1577525308,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85eByA8","user":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-05T21:56:25Z","updated_at":"2023-06-05T21:56:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@snazy Thanks for this PR, and I couldn't agree more that we need to keep the spec as close to the implementation as possible.
