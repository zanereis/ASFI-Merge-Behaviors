But, currently, we cannot expect its performance improvement. The code generation is designed to avoid Datum objects creations during any computations and reduce interpretation overheads like branches. \n\nBut, in order to keep the compatibility against our current Tuple and Datum mechanism, code generation feature still create lots of Datum objects; currently it creates objects two times for compatibility. Currently, I'm working new tuple structure using direct memory, which uses a sequence of bytes as a row blocks instead of an array of Datum objects. After than, it will give big performance benefits.\n\nThanks!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/53154532/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/53156149","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/113#issuecomment-53156149","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/113","id":53156149,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMTU2MTQ5","user":{"login":"blrunner","id":3724310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MjQzMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3724310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner","html_url":"https://github.com/blrunner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-23T15:32:55Z","updated_at":"2014-08-23T15:32:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1\n\nThank you for your detailed comments.\nI'm also looking forward for it to improve tajo performance. :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/53156149/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/53555888","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/127#issuecomment-53555888","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/127","id":53555888,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNTU1ODg4","user":{"login":"babokim","id":321821,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTgyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/321821?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/babokim","html_url":"https://github.com/babokim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/babokim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/babokim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/babokim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/babokim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/babokim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/babokim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/babokim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/babokim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/babokim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-27T11:18:53Z","updated_at":"2014-08-27T11:18:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1\nThanks your contribution, it looks good overall.\nI've tested on the real cluster and All tasks run successfully. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/53555888/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/53556064","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/127#issuecomment-53556064","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/127","id":53556064,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNTU2MDY0","user":{"login":"hyunsik","id":225941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/225941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik","html_url":"https://github.com/hyunsik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-27T11:20:54Z","updated_at":"2014-08-27T11:20:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thank you for the review.

I'd like to share a brief benchmark test result.\n\nExperimental environment was as follows:\n- Linux, \n- Intel Xeon, \n- 1 JVM worker, and 4 worker currency.\n- A local cluster\n\nData set is lineitem table of TPC-H 1GB.\n\nThe test query is \n\n```\nselect * from lineitem order by l_orderkey, l_partkey desc;\n```\n\nCurrent implementation: 55 - 60 seconds\nAfter OffHeapRowBlock : 22 - 25 seconds\n\nRoughly, it reduces about 50% query response time. This change only affects physical operators, so I think that a local cluster benchmark is sufficient.\n\nLater, I'll adopt OffHeapRowBlock to other operators and our operator model sequentially.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/54747093/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/55072401","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/135#issuecomment-55072401","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/135","id":55072401,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MDcyNDAx","user":{"login":"hyunsik","id":225941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/225941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik","html_url":"https://github.com/hyunsik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-09-10T05:25:05Z","updated_at":"2014-09-10T05:25:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"+1\nThe patch looks good to me.
