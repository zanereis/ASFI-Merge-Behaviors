I probably shouldn't have gone as deep in component implementation details in this SIP, as the intent here is to align on the design direction. I figured it was warranted to at least address the inevitable \"how do we implement this\" question, particularly as it relates to ongoing use of React-Bootstrap. \r\n\r\nI'm open to CSS-in-JS approaches, but want to make sure that vars/styles/mixins are shareable between custom components, and new or existing component libraries.\r\n\r\nI also share the concern about not opening the floodgates to disparate libraries/frameworks. That's why I'm personally hesitant to even add a second one while React-Bootstrap is still in the picture. I would be inclined to at least attempt a few components from scratch, thus the suggestion. Indeed, it's more work, but if a system evolves from it, that may lead to a longer lifecycle, rather than growing attached to another library which may potentially cause this same situation a year or two down the road.\r\n\r\nAll that said, the component implementation plan is worthy of deeper discussion, and probably being augmented by a related implementation-oriented SIP. The focus of this SIP was intended to be around the design work itself, and getting this new design direction adopted. I'm open to revision or removal those implementation suggestions if they're of major concern to this proposal.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/576458324/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/576477685","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/8978#issuecomment-576477685","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/8978","id":576477685,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NjQ3NzY4NQ==","user":{"login":"graceguo-supercat","id":27990562,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3OTkwNTYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27990562?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat","html_url":"https://github.com/graceguo-supercat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-21T01:14:48Z","updated_at":"2020-01-21T01:14:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I have seen similar error message, but caused by different data type: https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8946#issuecomment-573261231\r\n@robdiciuccio ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/576477685/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/576513307","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/8978#issuecomment-576513307","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/8978","id":576513307,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NjUxMzMwNw==","user":{"login":"robdiciuccio","id":296227,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjIyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/296227?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robdiciuccio","html_url":"https://github.com/robdiciuccio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robdiciuccio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robdiciuccio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robdiciuccio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robdiciuccio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robdiciuccio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robdiciuccio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robdiciuccio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robdiciuccio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robdiciuccio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-21T04:30:21Z","updated_at":"2020-01-21T04:30:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I can reproduce the issue locally with the query provided.

In my case i am using the docker version (docker-compose). If you do not use Superset with Docker, just try to find the frontend javascript files, i.e. with the browser console. So in my case i go first into the Superset Docker container with:\r\n\r\n$ docker ps\r\n$ docker exec -ti --user root yourContainerID bash \r\n\r\nonce there we'll need a text editor, like vim, so install it there:\r\n$ apt-get update\r\n$ apt-get upgrade\r\n$ apt-get install vim\r\n\r\nthen navigate to the folder /usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/superset/static/assets/dist/\r\n\r\n$ cd /usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/superset/static/assets/dist/\r\n\r\ncheck the existing files:\r\n\r\n$ ls\r\n\r\nthe javascript files there have kind of random generated names, so in my case i edit the file 37.6a8767f3d3757c9b0f62.chunk.js\r\n\r\n$ vim 37.6a8767f3d3757c9b0f62.chunk.js\r\n\r\nOnce there, add this code on the top of the existing code:\r\n\r\n`$(document).ready(function() {`\r\n`    console.log('Custom Script running... ')`\r\n`   var tabs = window.document.querySelectorAll('[role=\"tab\"]');`\r\n`    let myFunction = function() {`\r\n`        setTimeout(() => {`\r\n`            for (i = 0; i < window.document.getElementsByClassName('dataTables_scrollHead').length; i++) {`\r\n`                window.document.getElementsByClassName(\"dataTables_scrollHead\")[i].parentElement.parentElement.parentElement.parentElement.parentElement.parentElement.parentElement.parentElement.parentElement.parentElement.parentElement.querySelectorAll('[role=\"menuitem\"]')[0].click()`\r\n`            }`\r\n`        }, 200)`\r\n`    };`\r\n`    for (var i = 0; i < tabs.length; i++) {`\r\n`        tabs[i].addEventListener('click', myFunction, false);`\r\n`    }`\r\n`});`\r\n\r\n\r\nThis code just adds an event listener to every tab \"button\", so when it is clicked, a function looks for every table and refreshes it. \r\n\r\nA bad hack, i know, but at least it works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/576670469/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/576687376","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/8980#issuecomment-576687376","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/8980","id":576687376,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NjY4NzM3Ng==","user":{"login":"PeterCahn","id":19549658,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTQ5NjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19549658?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterCahn","html_url":"https://github.com/PeterCahn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterCahn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterCahn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterCahn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterCahn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterCahn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterCahn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterCahn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterCahn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterCahn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-21T13:42:56Z","updated_at":"2020-01-21T13:42:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I also had this problem and I fixed it by changing the assignment of the variable `username` in `_bind_ldap` (when `AUTH_LDAP_BIND_USER` is set to `True`)\r\n\r\nI use the following command:\r\n\r\n`sed -i 's/username = user\\[0\\]\\[0\\]/username = user\\[1\\]\\[0\\]/' /usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/flask_appbuilder/security/manager.py`\r\n\r\nThough this is probably a problem of Flask Appbuilder or of an LDAP misconfiguration, I hope it helps.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/576687376/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/576751206","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/8980#issuecomment-576751206","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/8980","id":576751206,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3Njc1MTIwNg==","user":{"login":"bharath0208","id":44377322,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0Mzc3MzIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44377322?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharath0208","html_url":"https://github.com/bharath0208","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharath0208/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharath0208/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharath0208/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharath0208/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharath0208/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharath0208/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharath0208/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharath0208/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharath0208/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-21T16:02:57Z","updated_at":"2020-01-21T16:04:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@PeterCahn @dpgaspar \r\n\r\nThanks peter I have added this value already when AUTH_LDAP_BIND_USER is set to True.

It does provide a way to override some of the security manager's functionality so that you can delegate to your own authentication system. Here's some documentation about the security manager: https://flask-appbuilder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/security.html\r\n\r\nSomething that comes to mind, you could use OAuth and then rely on your oauth provider to handle MFA. Something like https://auth0.com/ and google should have options for forcing users to use MFA. \r\n\r\nAs for the roadmap, I do not know of any current plans to add MFA functionality to superset.

I think that generally using the bootstrap-defined classes conventions seems reasonable to me (`panel`, `table`, `form`, `btn`, `btn-sm`, ...). In many cases `react-bootstrap` is simply wrapping/exposing classes as components and/or props. If we commit loosely to the bootstrap CSS conventions, we may not have to touch many of the `react-bootstrap` components for a moment, and iterate slowly towards the look and feel proposed here.\r\n\r\nMaybe this is shortsighted, but a decent percentage of the theme-related-work to make Superset look like the design suggested in this SIP can be done directly in the existing files under `superset/assets/stylesheets/less/`.\r\n\r\nOne big question is whether we want to make the theme somewhat environment or user-tunable.

This is a regression since at some point people didn't want to list the databases that users don't have access to. By restricting this now you cannot see the database in the list. All the other mechanics for per-table access should be in place once we address this.\r\n\r\nThe logic defining that list is here:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/003e98c231801b0ea34ebaefcff06c7ae9568faf/superset/views/database/mixins.py#L43-L51\r\n\r\nI think logically if a user is given access to a table, they should be able to list out the database attached to it. I think it's preferable to infer that, instead of say alternatively, creating another \"can list this specific database\" permission.\r\n\r\nThe way to fix this is to figure out which tables the user has access to, and add a close in the or_ that essentially says `OR id IN (SELECT database_id FROM sqla_table WHERE perm IN (...{more subqueries in the security related tables}...))`\r\n\r\nCurrently, calling `security_manager.user_view_menu_names(\"database_access\")` in the process creates an extra database round trip, and while we could to something similar for `table_access`, it'd be preferable to do a single round trip through a more complex query, using subqueries or equivalent.

needed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/577457922/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/577461449","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/8992#issuecomment-577461449","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/8992","id":577461449,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NzQ2MTQ0OQ==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-23T01:16:34Z","updated_at":"2020-01-23T01:20:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"BTW,

Amazing on so many levels. However, I feel inclined to extend a few thoughts:\r\n- The general look and feel is really fresh and much more intuitive and modern than the current appearance.\r\n- Two of the things that really stand out to me are as follows:\r\n   1) showing more context around objects (datasets, charts, columns): if the backend can handle the additional load of showing column-wise distributions, usage stats on the chart pages etc then it will make data ever more approachable. It might be a good idea to make this behavior configurable, too, especially for for environments with dbs that aren't up to the challenge of serving all this additional info. Parts of this retrieval should probably be highly async to ensure the UX stays responsive.\r\n   2) The metrics/columns in the Explore view really make charting much more approachable for newbies. I've noticed that some BI tools have a very steep learning curve; Using terminology/labels like \"X-axis\", \"Y-axis\" make it much more intuitive for novices than \"metric\", \"temporal column\". Having said that, there is the risk of limiting functionality at the expense of lower learning curve (especially thinking Tableau vs PowerBI here), so one might need to proceed with caution on making big changes here.\r\n- Regarding widespread customizability of appearance, I personally usually prefer to have products look like themselves rather than the company in which they're used. However, being able to configure Dashboard/Viz appearances (fonts, colors etc) is really important, and can be vital in ensuring that the visualizations can be used as widely as possible in the target organization, both for internal and external presentations/materials.\r\n- I think this was contained in another SIP, but feel worthwile mentioning here comments on the removal of tabs in Sql Lab. @cgivre mentioned hesitation at removal of tabs, and that was my first reaction, too. However, having thought more closely about it I believe the user experience could benefit from a the new approach, especially if old queries are easy to find. I've noticed that tabs tend to pile up after a while, and generally only leads to lots of tabs with useless stale queries. But that might just be me.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/577839920/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/577842095","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/9000#issuecomment-577842095","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/9000","id":577842095,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3Nzg0MjA5NQ==","user":{"login":"nytai","id":10255196,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjU1MTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10255196?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai","html_url":"https://github.com/nytai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-23T19:40:55Z","updated_at":"2020-01-23T19:40:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@umesh11111 You should be able to make other users \"owners\" of your chart.

Awesome level up.\r\n\r\nI have a few questions:\r\n- What's the reflexion behind the Explore view overhaul? The proposal looks very similar to several other BI tools but my personal feeling is that the way Superset currently does it is superior. The datasource being totally displayed probably helps data discovery but also makes the display less light. Also, the new way to build metrics, filters, group by's, etc, feels less intuitive to me. Last point, don't you think pushing the results table to the default display instead of in a modal makes the process more directed towards experts who want to review the underlying data and less towards self service for everyone?\r\n- Though I love the idea of having previews of the graphs everywhere, I'm a little concerned about the way that would be fulfilled. If my memory is correct, Max did a PR in the past to go that way but it relied on Selenium doing screenshots of everything. That dependency feels a bit fat to me, what do you think? And rendering real graphs from queries seems to considerably increase the load on the databases.\r\n- Last comment, I like the tabs in the SQLlab üò∫ \r\n\r\nSorry if I'm mistaken somewhere and thanks again for the awesome contribution!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/577880497/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/577887592","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/9006#issuecomment-577887592","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/9006","id":577887592,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3Nzg4NzU5Mg==","user":{"login":"john-bodley","id":4567245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjcyNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4567245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley","html_url":"https://github.com/john-bodley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-23T21:34:42Z","updated_at":"2020-01-23T21:34:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@mistercrunch do you know if there are any plans to add typing to `pydruid`?
