A Caravel SQLAlchemy datasource can only be a single table or a view.\n\nWhen working with tables, the solution would be to materialize a table that contains all the fields needed for your analysis, most likely through some scheduled batch process.\n\nA view is a simple logical layer that abstract an arbitrary SQL queries as a virtual table. This can allow you to join and union multiple tables, and to apply some transformation using arbitrary SQL expressions. The limitation there is your database performance as Caravel effectively will run a query on top of your query (view). A good practice may be to limit yourself to joining your main large table to one or many small tables only, and avoid using GROUP BY where possible as Caravel will do its own GROUP BY and doing the work twice might slow down performance.\n\nWhether you use a table or a view, the important factor is whether your database is fast enough to serve it in an interactive fashion to provide a good user experience in Caravel.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/236987833/reactions","total_count":22,"+1":0,"-1":2,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":20,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/236988212","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/875#issuecomment-236988212","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/875","id":236988212,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNjk4ODIxMg==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-02T17:59:32Z","updated_at":"2016-08-02T17:59:32Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Though

tried to upgrade caravel and dependencies (with pip), tested with couple PG users and connection string variants, no spaces or any funky symbols, other software uses the same user with no problems
