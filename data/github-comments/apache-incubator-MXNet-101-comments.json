@mli  i found a  a potential problem of mx.io.ImageRecordIter --> **when set rand_crop = True, then during each epoch the cropped  area of the same image is the same.**, (wish i'm wrong..)  \n\nif this is a bug, then it will influence the resnet result, because our training rec is 480, and for the same image in each epoch, it only see the same area, so the scale augment does't work at all. \n\nwe can reproduced this like this:\n\n``` python\n    train = mx.io.ImageRecordIter(...)  # set random_crop=True, data_shape less than the size of .rec\n    import numpy as np\n    import cv2\n    for i in range(10):\n        X = train.getdata().asnumpy()[i]\n        X=np.swapaxes(X, 0, 2)\n        X=np.swapaxes(X, 0, 1)\n        X = cv2.cvtColor(X, cv2.COLOR_RGB2BGR)\n        cv2.imwrite(\"{}_result.jpg\".format(i), X)\n        print \"image_{}--->{}\".format(i, train.getlabel().asnumpy()[i])\n    train.reset()\n    for i in range(10):\n        X = train.getdata().asnumpy()[i]\n        X=np.swapaxes(X, 0, 2)\n        X=np.swapaxes(X, 0, 1)\n        X = cv2.cvtColor(X, cv2.COLOR_RGB2BGR)\n        cv2.imwrite(\"{}_reset_result.jpg\".format(i), X)\n        print \"reset_image_{}--->{}\".format(i, train.getlabel().asnumpy()[i])\n    train.reset()\n    for i in range(10):\n        X = train.getdata().asnumpy()[i]\n        X=np.swapaxes(X, 0, 2)\n        X=np.swapaxes(X, 0, 1)\n        X = cv2.cvtColor(X, cv2.COLOR_RGB2BGR)\n        cv2.imwrite(\"{}_reset2_result.jpg\".format(i), X)\n        print \"reset2_image_{}--->{}\".format(i, train.getlabel().asnumpy()[i])\n```\n\nthen the corresponding image is the same. \nthe same phenomenon may happen with random mirror.  \n\nbut when i debug into https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/master/src/io/image_aug_default.cc#L241, i print out the y and x and found it should changed after each epoch.  \ncould anybody verify

after looking into this a bit more in detail, here are my thoughts and maybe we can find a way to make this easier during the way to 1.0\n\nTo compile a julia function as a kernel, I need type information for that function. In most cases we will want to pass in DeviceArrays that use data from NDArrays. These DeviceArrays are parameterized, by DType and NDims. For each signature combination of DType and NDims I need to compile a new kernel. \n\nThis means that `InferShape` and `InferType` need to have run already before I can initialise the PTX, that then get's translated into a `CUmodule` and `CUfunction` optimized per device and then run. \n\nI then need to communicate that information from a safe point (preferably a synchronous call, async might work but requires a lot more work and is fragile). The current outline of how this might look like can be seen at https://github.com/vchuravy/JLNDArrayOp .\nTomorrow I am going to write the Julia side of this and making it more safe (there are some unsafe hacks in there right now.)\n\nAny feedback would be welcome. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/239066668/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/239079198","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/2995#issuecomment-239079198","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/2995","id":239079198,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzOTA3OTE5OA==","user":{"login":"tornadomeet","id":5860892,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NjA4OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5860892?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tornadomeet","html_url":"https://github.com/tornadomeet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tornadomeet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tornadomeet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tornadomeet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tornadomeet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tornadomeet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tornadomeet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tornadomeet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tornadomeet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tornadomeet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-11T05:53:49Z","updated_at":"2016-08-11T05:53:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"yes, you can.  \njust as trainning,  create model = mx.model.FeedForward(...) first, then prepare your test.rec, at last use it like this:  \n`logging.info(\"top-1 and top-5 acc is {}\".format(model.score(X = test, eval_metric = ['acc', mx.metric.create('top_k_accuracy', top_k = 5)])))`\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/239079198/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/239079797","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/2585#issuecomment-239079797","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/2585","id":239079797,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzOTA3OTc5Nw==","user":{"login":"Lorrainexun","id":18624925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI0OTI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18624925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lorrainexun","html_url":"https://github.com/Lorrainexun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lorrainexun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lorrainexun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lorrainexun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lorrainexun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lorrainexun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lorrainexun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lorrainexun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lorrainexun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lorrainexun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-11T05:59:50Z","updated_at":"2016-08-11T05:59:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"It still cant work well  with inception-BN model.

To build NNPACK with portable SIMD implementation instead of x86-64 assembly, configure with `python configure.py --enable-psimd`.

It says the default is \"null\", which means nothing will be done. \"batch\" means  \"op will normalize gradient by dividing batch size\", while \"valid\" means \" op will normalize gradient by divide sample not ignored\". \nI have 2 questions:\n1. Does this have the same effect if I set this to \"null\" and set an appropriate grad_scale?\n2. Does \"valid samples\" mean all samples or only samples in a batch? For example, I have a multi-output softmax, say (2, 3, 100), which mean batch size=2, channel=3 and sample=100. If I set \"batch\", it divides by 2, right? If I use \"valid\" does it divide by 100? or (2x100)? If true, does it mean I dont need to change the gradient scale anymore and leave them to default 1.0?\nI think this is really important to know if I want to make sure the training is under control.
