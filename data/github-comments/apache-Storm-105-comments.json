data-issue-key=\"STORM-1005\"><del>STORM-1005</del></a>replace default storm.local.dir value to absolute path.</p>\n\n<p>    One of my supervisors shutdown by it self after running for a few weeks.After I restart the supervisor from another directory(actually I don't remember which directory I started the supervisor at first.Then the workers running on that machine become wild.They running as usual,but the supervisor can't detect them,and I can't shutdown them with `storm kill`.When I submit a new topology,the supervisor will try to start new a worker with the port running workers already used,it will cause failure.</p>\n\n<p>    It's hard form a typical user to know why such exception happens,so I think it's better to set storm.local.dir as a absolute path.</p>\n\n<p>    If `storm.local.dir` can be set to `$STORM_HOME/storm-local`,it may be best.But it seems yaml file only support constant values.</p>\n\n<p>You can merge this pull request into a Git repository by

rate and tuple sojourn time to QueueMetrics</p>\n\n<p>    I added two important metrics, namely <b>arrival time</b> and <b>sojourn time</b>, to QueueMetrics. </p>\n\n<p>    Modification Summary:<br/>\n    1. Created a new RateTracker utility, which could report instantaneous rate upon certain event;<br/>\n    2. Added test cases for RateTracker;<br/>\n    3. Added arrival rate and sojourn time metrics to QueueMetrics; <br/>\n    4. Use sampling in QueueMetrics to reduce the metric maintenance cost. </p>\n\n<p>    Such metrics are very useful to performance tuning, especially for application with strong constraint on processing latency such as thread detection and smart traffic. A high sojourn time, for example, indicates that a higher degree of parallelism should be applied to the current bolt in order to reduce processing delay. </p>\n\n<p>    Any comment or suggestion
