I believe it can be validated using existing code in the project (it appears that it can be validated with runAllDimensionReduction.sh, which generates PCA data and then runs PCA.dml on that data). So perhaps Krishna can simply validate that the new script runs with runAllDimensionReduction.sh? If the functionalized PCA script runs like the non-functionalized PCA script, then it can be merged.\r\n\r\nAdditional tasks such as automated testing could be performed as additional PRs. For example, an automated MLContext PCA test JIRA could be created under [SYSTEMML-1645](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SYSTEMML-1645). The SystemML project as a whole could definitey use improved algorithm testing, but I think issues like that should be handled in separate PRs.\r\n\r\nPerhaps a comment could be added to the staging/PCA.dml file indicating that this script is a functionalized version of the original PCA.dml script?\r\n\r\ncc @dusenberrymw ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/329869986/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/329884927","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/662#issuecomment-329884927","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/662","id":329884927,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyOTg4NDkyNw==","user":{"login":"akchinSTC","id":13340013,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzQwMDEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13340013?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC","html_url":"https://github.com/akchinSTC","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-15T19:54:09Z","updated_at":"2017-09-15T19:54:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"\nRefer to this link for build results (access rights to CI server needed): \nhttps://sparktc.ibmcloud.com/jenkins/job/SystemML-PullRequestBuilder/2102/\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/329884927/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/329918092","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/666#issuecomment-329918092","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/666","id":329918092,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyOTkxODA5Mg==","user":{"login":"gweidner","id":12058879,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4ODc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058879?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner","html_url":"https://github.com/gweidner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-15T22:25:51Z","updated_at":"2017-09-15T22:25:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Tested the following on linux:\r\n\r\n`mvn clean package -DskipTests=true -P distribution`\r\n\r\n`./release-verify.sh --compile`\r\n`./release-verify.sh --verifyLic --distDir=\"../../target\"`\r\n\r\n`pip install ./target/systemml-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-python.tar.gz`\r\n\r\nRan matrix example in PySpark.
