I like the recursive call to generate 'Copy of Copy of ...'. I was successfully imported the same PG having public ports inside more than once without changing the port name manually.\r\nAlso, confirmed that further changes to public ports can be propagated to the imported PG by updating flow version. It works as expected :)\r\n\r\nOne question though, it seems that changing PublicPort 'Concurrent Tasks' is not detected as a local change. I confirmed Processor 'Concurrent Tasks' is version tracked. So, I think we should do that for PublicPort as well.

So for now I introduced another default in the Evaluator interface: `cleanUpNeeded`\r\nThere is an additional array containing only the stateful evaluators of the tree that need cleanup. That should be better for performance.\r\n\r\nWe are probably going to deploy self-built version using this PR on our cluster after some more testing to see how it impacts CPU usage. We'll let you know how it goes.\r\n\r\nDifferent subject: The problem with `OrEvaluator` and `AndEvaluator` also exists for PR #3277 . \r\nYou can test that by using `${hello:contains('H'):and(${hello:contains('o')})}` and changing the value of hello from `Hello` to `Hell` between calls with one PreparedQuery. The result will be `true` in both cases if you start with `Hello`, even though it should not be.\r\n\r\nIncluding those essential functions (`and` + `or`) in the group where the evaluator tree is rebuilt for each call would mean that many of the expressions we use in production wouldn't benefit from the performance gains of PR #3277 . \r\n\r\nAnother idea, if you don't like using the new default interface methods in `Evaluator` would be to use some kind of a evaluation context that is passed through the tree. It can cache sub results during one evaluation and a new context would be passed for each new evaluation. That way we could get rid of having state in the evaluators itself.

Before the PR, it behaved as \"expected\" (rolling back the session and not routing the invalid flowfile anywhere). After the PR, it behaved as expected on first start, doing the same action. I stopped the processor and changed it to not automatically terminate the Failure relationship, changed \"Failure Action\" to \"Route\" and connected Failure relationship to another component. The processor then sent the flowfiles to that connection as expected. \r\n\r\nI did notice some odd behavior on that connection -- flowfiles would queue there even when the destination was running. This wasn't a throughput issue; I could stop the producer and the flowfiles remained in the queue until I stopped all components and then started only the destination.

It's interesting that this was only brought up as an issue for new relationships. Anytime a new property is added to a processor this same issue also happens; I've had several developers complain about it, especially when we upgrade the TEST environment before upgrading PROD. They push their flow to the Registry from the upgraded TEST environment, deploy to PROD, and NiFi tells them their Flow is invalid because they have an invalid property. They delete the property, then their flow is out of sync with the registry. They end up just deleting the whole process group when we upgrade PROD and redeploying.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/499519480/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/499545026","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3507#issuecomment-499545026","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3507","id":499545026,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5OTU0NTAyNg==","user":{"login":"thenatog","id":38888042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg4MDQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38888042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog","html_url":"https://github.com/thenatog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-06T15:29:35Z","updated_at":"2019-06-06T15:29:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've added an XXE validator to the CommonsConfigurationLookupService to do a simple check if the file contains an !ENTITY declaration.
