For example:\r\n1. Recycle the exclusive buffers to increase credit after record processed.\r\n2. The buffer pool notifies the channel of available floating buffers to increase credit\r\n3. When receiving the backlog from producer, it may trigger to request floating buffers from buffer pool. Credit is increased when returned floating buffers from buffer pool.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/336005691/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/336043848","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4805#issuecomment-336043848","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4805","id":336043848,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNjA0Mzg0OA==","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-12T07:24:57Z","updated_at":"2017-10-12T07:24:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Often happens due to different dependency/build system versions of even OS specific oddities.
