That is ok...and it does support a direct integration.\r\n\r\nHowever, PutInfluxDBRecord addresses the problem of reading the data. It simplifies data parsing and handling using the concept of Records ( https://blogs.apache.org/nifi/entry/record-oriented-data-with-nifi )\r\nIt more naturally works with Nifi objects and the fields, tags are configurable from within the Nifi IDE...which delivers a much more integrated experience.\r\n\r\nFor example: Reading Twitter with PutInfluxDB is not possible without coding/external configuration. On the contrary, reading Twitter JSON via PutInfluxDBRecord is no-dev effort and leverages the tools within NiFi itself.\r\n\r\nStill, the two classes can coexist depending on the type of work that needs to be done.

The second flow reads a row from rdbms based on id input file containing a single id, classifies the observation and save the classification results for same row in output column.  \r\n\r\nThe supporting files along with a sample classification model that will work with the two templates are in the repository [nifi-flow-examples](https://github.com/mans2singh/nifi-flow-examples.git) branch nifi-dl4j-flow.  \r\n\r\nHere are some details of the two flow templates:\r\n\r\n1. The first template is simple one [NifiDL4JFileInputOutput.xml](https://github.com/mans2singh/nifi-flow-examples/blob/nifi-dl4j-flow/dl4jtemplate/NifiDL4JFileInputOutput.xml) that ingests file containing an observation record from directory (sample input in dl4jinput), applies the classification model and writes results to the output directory with the same file name as input.  In this scenario, the correlation is based on the file names.\r\n\r\n2. The second [NifiDL4JFileToRdbms.xml](https://github.com/mans2singh/nifi-flow-examples/blob/nifi-dl4j-flow/dl4jtemplate/NifiDL4JFileToRdbms.xml) reads a single id from input file (sample in dl4jinputid directory), queries a rdbms table for the observations for the input id, classifies the observation and updates the db row with classification results.  In this flow template, the row id of the input is used as a correlation id which is used to update the output column of the corresponding row after the classification is done. The flow uses other Nifi processors to ingest, transform, save the classification results.  The table creation and observation row insertion commands are in dl4jsql directory. \r\n\r\nThe flow templates require setting the appropriate input/output files, dl4j model, db controller and rdbms table with the records.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know your thoughts/feedback.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nMans","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/397937706/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/397957968","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2686#issuecomment-397957968","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2686","id":397957968,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5Nzk1Nzk2OA==","user":{"login":"ijokarumawak","id":1107620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak","html_url":"https://github.com/ijokarumawak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-18T06:51:27Z","updated_at":"2018-06-18T06:51:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi @mans2singh \r\n\r\nThanks for sharing the templates. I will try it later but I understand how it works by using RDMBS to join input data and classification results.\r\n\r\nI think we need to provide more toolset so that people can use DL4J easily from NiFi flows. So a couple of points for further discussion:\r\n\r\n1. Have you ever considered a DL4J component implementing RecordLookup interface so that LookupRecord processor? I've mentioned about this before. Once we provide this pattern, RDBMS is no longer required to use evaluation result in later flow.\r\n\r\n2. How would NiFi user convert a raw data (CSV, text, images, audio ... etc) into vector format that can be fed to DL4J Networks? I haven't explored yet myself, but can we provide some other Processors or RecordReader/Writers to do vectorization process, probably using DataVec? https://deeplearning4j.org/datavec\r\n\r\n\r\nI will ask dev ML to see if there's anyone to join the review process, too.

can't find any examples on where an \"original\" relationship is available when progressive commits are also available, for the reason you mention above. Progressive commits are available in QueryDatabaseTable but it is a source processor and doesn't accept incoming flow files. The \"original\" relationship is in processors like SplitXYZ where the content is changed but the original input might need to be preserved, and all flow files are committed once at the end. [NIFI-2878](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-2878) is an open issue to allow \"streaming splits\", but my guess is that the original relationship will not be available, or we'd want to have consensus that \"original\" can have different behavior based on the \"partial commits\" idea.\r\n\r\nI've considered a couple approaches for this:\r\n1) Do not transfer the input flow file to \"original\" if doing incremental commits\r\n2) Transfer the input flow file to \"original\" on the first incremental commit\r\n\r\nMy concern with the former is that it may still be necessary to access the input flow file. My concern with the latter is that it kind of implies that an operation has succeeded, when continued processing after the first commit can fail. At that point the flow may assume all flow files have been processed (some flows count on \"original\" be emitted at the end of successful processing and is used as a trigger).

It didn't have an \"original\" relationship so that wasn't an issue, but the documentation explains that some attributes won't be populated if \"Output Batch Size\" is specified.\r\n\r\nHaving a source processor (GetMongo) with an \"original\" relationship is where it got a little weird for me, as the pattern I'm aware of (that is getting increasingly popular) is to have source processors accept incoming flow files for the purpose of configuration, not content per se. That's why I wasn't sure where the \"original\" relationship belonged in the use case. Often it is used as a downstream trigger that all documents were processed, but that wouldn't apply if we were using incremental commits.\r\n\r\nI'd prefer to avoid a new processor if we can make it work in a user-friendly manner for GetMongo. My vote is for my option #1 above, with sufficient documentation to describe the behavior. If the use case dictates the need for the \"original\" flow file to be transferred, then they won't be able to use incremental commits. On the other hand (as @bbende suggested to me), they could always send the upstream flow to both GetMongo (with incremental commits) and to another flow. At that point it'd be similar to my option #2 where a different downstream flow would get the original flow file while it was also being worked on by GetMongo. By keeping the child flow files connected to the original as a parent (via provenance and the session), we still have the lineage intact.

worth looking at. It also provides a good entry point to start working on that GetMongoRecord processor that was requested today.\r\n\r\nRight now, the refactoring of the Mongo code is coming together kinda as a puzzle between different commits. For example, part of the update to the schema handling in the lookup service established a clean separation between the lookup service and client service there. I need that merged so I can finish the client-service-as-optional-pool/config commit. Then we can stack these parent class changes and this commit onto that and it'll look like a complete puzzle, not a house of cards about to collapse.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/399195878/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
