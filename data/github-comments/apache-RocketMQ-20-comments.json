for @lizhanhui's feature request，and as mentioned above, with the rise of micro service architecture，developers are eager to use a mechanism to ensure the eventual consistency of transaction, especially in distributed systems, and we also found transaction aware message can achieve this goal gracefully, so we intend to implement this feature in rocketMQ, and this process is as follows：\r\n\r\n\r\n![transaction](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39583243/40928949-a6e0b728-6855-11e8-863e-f69faa80e4f5.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our design, we will define a pair of message: named half message and commit/rollback message. As mentioned by @lizhanhui, half message means prepared message, which are not visible to consumers，and it will be sent before local transaction is executed. After the local transaction ends，producer will send a commit or rollback message  to broker based on local transaction execution result. when producers are blocked or crashed after send a half message，the broker will check all of producers with the same role to obtain the transaction status, so producer must implement the check listener interface to response transaction check query request.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our implementation, we will make full use of the mechanism of rocketMQ itself to avoid external dependencies, so we will build two new system topic to store half message（RMQ_SYS_TRANS_HALF_TOPIC）and commit/rollback result message(RMQ_SYS_TRANS_OP_HALF_TOPIC)，and we will also add a checkback service in broker to periodically check every message in the half message queue, if its corresponding result message can be found in the result message queue, it will be consumed or discarded depends on its result status，and if this message cannot be found in the result queue，that indicates that it was in pending status， so the checkback service will send check request to all corresponding producers to obtain transaction status, at the same time，we will also support immunity time config for producer to avoid being checked prematurely, the pending but still in immunity time message will be reload to the half message queue to wait for the next round of check.\r\n\r\nWe will submit a PR in the community， welcome to provide comments and review code.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/394414833/reactions","total_count":24,"+1":21,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":2,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/394416194","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/332#issuecomment-394416194","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/332","id":394416194,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NDQxNjE5NA==","user":{"login":"Hellojungle","id":18479517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDc5NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18479517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hellojungle","html_url":"https://github.com/Hellojungle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hellojungle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hellojungle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hellojungle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hellojungle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hellojungle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hellojungle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hellojungle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hellojungle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hellojungle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-04T16:26:26Z","updated_at":"2018-06-04T16:27:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"#217

I had checked  cpu/memory/disk used/io page out/network utilization, none of those were system bottleneck.\r\n\r\nCould anyone give me some suggestions?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/403334768/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/403342028","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/348#issuecomment-403342028","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/348","id":403342028,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMzM0MjAyOA==","user":{"login":"lizhanhui","id":641819,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MTgxOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/641819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui","html_url":"https://github.com/lizhanhui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-09T02:26:35Z","updated_at":"2018-07-09T02:26:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The short answer is: In your broker configuration file, configure this entry: waitTimeMillsInSendQueue to a larger value to override the default one: 200.\r\n\r\nLong answer:\r\nWhen configured as synchronous disk IO flush, it takes time to sync data of a small batch of messages to disk before writing responses to message sender. Those unprocessed requests are buffered in a queue. To ensure broker won't suspend producer excessive long period of time, it will expire sending requests if they are not processed within `waitTimeMillsInSendQueue`, which may block application too long in case synchronous sending API is employed.  This strategy, in general, is called __fail-early, fail-fast__. \r\n\r\nThe default value is tuned for asynchrous disk flushing. In case synchronous disk flushing is used, you'd better __measure and tune__.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/403342028/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/403343421","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/348#issuecomment-403343421","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/348","id":403343421,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMzM0MzQyMQ==","user":{"login":"aiqing2171","id":12061924,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDYxOTI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12061924?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiqing2171","html_url":"https://github.com/aiqing2171","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiqing2171/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiqing2171/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiqing2171/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiqing2171/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiqing2171/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiqing2171/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiqing2171/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiqing2171/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aiqing2171/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-09T02:37:02Z","updated_at":"2018-07-09T02:37:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I changed broker config( synchronous disk IO flush) as below:\r\nsendMessageThreadPoolNums=16\r\nuseReentrantLockWhenPutMessage=true\r\nTps was improved to be 2400.  should we use reentrantLock instead of spin lock?\r\n ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/403343421/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/403366864","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/357#issuecomment-403366864","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/357","id":403366864,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMzM2Njg2NA==","user":{"login":"vongosling","id":635581,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNTU4MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/635581?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling","html_url":"https://github.com/vongosling","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-09T05:49:22Z","updated_at":"2018-07-09T05:49:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Redo it ?

We prefer to use full-word in the identifier, it would be better if this pull request may follow this convention. \r\n5.
