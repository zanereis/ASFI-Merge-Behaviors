I would like to ask you for one more favor. As you might know, Join was previously called Match and the name was changed quite some time ago. All public interfaces were updated but the name Match lives on in many places in the internals. It would be great if you could update `match` to `join` in the classes that you rewrite (esp. in JavaDocs and parameter names). I started adding comments for that, but stopped at one point.\n\n@r-pogalz looking forward to the microbenchmark!\n\nThank you, Fabian\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/126304357/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/126320398","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/937#issuecomment-126320398","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/937","id":126320398,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyNjMyMDM5OA==","user":{"login":"gyfora","id":5880972,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODA5NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5880972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora","html_url":"https://github.com/gyfora","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-30T13:19:00Z","updated_at":"2015-07-30T13:19:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"If no other comments I would like to merge this.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/126320398/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/126380793","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/939#issuecomment-126380793","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/939","id":126380793,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyNjM4MDc5Mw==","user":{"login":"chiwanpark","id":1941681,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDE2ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1941681?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark","html_url":"https://github.com/chiwanpark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-30T15:59:10Z","updated_at":"2015-07-30T15:59:10Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi @jamescao, thanks for your contribution. I read this pull request and have some comments about this.\n\nFirst, Test cases are insufficient. There is no test cases to test Scala API, Case Classes, and POJOs. `CsvInputFormat` supports Tuple, Case Classes, and POJOs. We should add test cases to test them.\n\nSecond, I think that Scala implementation is not good to use. There is already logic of reading CSV file in `DataSet` of Scala API (`readCsvFile()` method). I think that reusing this method is better then current implementation. `readCsvFile()` method already supports Case Classes, POJOs and Tuples. The method is tested well. If reuse the method, we can reduce many duplicated codes.\n\nThird, It is just my opinion. I think that test cases using file decreases testing performance. Flink community have tried to improve stability and performance of testing. We are changing test cases to use memory to compare results. `collect()` method and comparing list or array are sufficient to test. I know there are some test cases using file, but using memory to compare results is better than using file for new test cases.\n\nFourth, `CsvOptions` is not same pattern as other configuration object in Flink. In Flink, many configuration objects implement builder pattern. Each setter method should return this object. You can use `CsvReader` class to reference.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/126380793/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/126398181","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/960#issuecomment-126398181","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/960","id":126398181,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyNjM5ODE4MQ==","user":{"login":"ggevay","id":11377925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzc3OTI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11377925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggevay","html_url":"https://github.com/ggevay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggevay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggevay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggevay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggevay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggevay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggevay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggevay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggevay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggevay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-30T16:45:00Z","updated_at":"2015-07-30T16:45:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I

I ran through the classes and tried to catch all occurrences of `match` and replaced them by `join`. Hopefully I did not miss something :)\n\nMoreover, I set up a benchmark with JMH and did several runs on my machine (MacBook Air, 1.3 GHz Intel Core i5, 4 GB 1600 MHz DDR3). I pushed the code on another branch, so you can check it for further information (commit can be seen [here](https://github.com/r-pogalz/flink/commit/0385055dfe92d076c348be66308886ee2936ab56). I decided to test a dedicated class for the Left Outer Join against the left outer join using the existing class for all types. An iteration in the benchmark measures the time needed to perform the outer join for the entire inputs. For the first couple of runs I chose a fixed cardinality of 10k entries for the right input. I varied the input size of the left input (20k, 50k and 100k).\n\n| Cardinality of left input | Same class (avg. time in seconds) | Dedicated class (avg. time in seconds) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 20k | **4.264** | 4.282 |\n| 50k | **7.845** | 7.913 |\n| 100k | 14.090 | **13.907** |\n\nMoreover, I did a test run with **50k entries on both inputs** and got the following results:\n\n| Same class (avg. time in seconds) | Dedicated class (avg. time in seconds) |\n| --- | --- |\n| **10.251** | 10.571 |\n\nThe results show that both implementations perform almost similar. So I guess the JIT compiler does proper optimizations concerning the if-statements in our current implementation. Or what do you think @fhueske and @chiwanpark ?\n\nI also pushed the results.

In that case, the scala test I uploaded is inappropriate in the first place.  If we introduce `fromCsvFile` for scala table api, it should be in `org.apace.flink.api.scala.table.TableEnviroment`.

The code is really well tested and well structured. Great work :-)\n\nI had only some minor comments. There is however one thing I'm not so sure about. With the current implementation, all parallel tasks of the sampling operator will get the same random generator/seed value. Thus, every node will generate the same sequence of random numbers. I think this can have a negative influence on the sampling. What we could do is to use `RichMapPartitionFunction` instead of the `MapPartitionFunction`. With the rich function, we either have access to the subtask index, given by `getRuntimeContext().getIndexOfThisSubtask()`,  which we could use to modify the initial seed or we generate the random number generator in the `open` method (this method is executed on the TaskManager). Assuming that the clocks are not completely synchronized and that the individual tasks will be instantiated not at the same time, this could give us less correlated random number sequences. What do you think? \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/126740651/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/126752412","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/934#issuecomment-126752412","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/934","id":126752412,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyNjc1MjQxMg==","user":{"login":"mxm","id":837221,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNzIyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/837221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm","html_url":"https://github.com/mxm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-31T17:00:54Z","updated_at":"2015-07-31T17:00:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @kl0u ,\n\nThanks for addressing my comments. I've made some new ones :) but looks much better.\n\nAs for merging the different types of snapshots, the only solution I see now, is to let all the accumulator results go through the BlobCache. That might cause some extra latency at the end of the job. I'm not sure whether we should proceed on that path but the current solution has a lot of added overhead because we need to deal with two different kind of update mechanisms.\n\nI would like to hear some other opinions on whether we should have both update mechanisms (BlobCache and Akka message-based) or just let everything go through the BlobCache. I'm leaning more towards the latter if it is not too slow for slow accumulators.\n\nI think you have to rebase to the latest master again because of some minor changes.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/126752412/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/126916758","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/956#issuecomment-126916758","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/956","id":126916758,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyNjkxNjc1OA==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-01T13:41:03Z","updated_at":"2015-08-01T13:41:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This change was actually API breaking (binary compatibility).

But then we leave the part about implementing the `setRuntimeContext` and `getRuntimeContext` to the user. IMO that's not a very good option. So it makes sense to extend rich formats from abstract Rich formats. Doing that, I couldn't figure out a better solution if we want to make all existing IO formats rich. To sum it up:\n1. If we only defined an interface, we leave the implementation of `setter` and `getter` methods to the user.\n2. If we write a Rich abstract class, we have to make all existing IO formats rich since the user might want to extend one of these, and of course can't extend two classes.\nIf there's a way to achieve this, let me know. I might have missed something.\n\nAs for the `postConfigure` method, it was to guarantee that the `RuntimeContext` will be available now. I tried initializing the context in `DataSourceTask` and `DataSinkTask` before calling `configure`, but it seems the format is re-initialized somewhere as that information is lost. I could remove this function and we can just initialize `counters` etc. in `open` call.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/127037112/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/127039256","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/928#issuecomment-127039256","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/928","id":127039256,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyNzAzOTI1Ng==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-02T15:51:36Z","updated_at":"2015-08-02T15:51:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The CI builds still fail for this patch, have a look at the Travis report.\nAll tests and checks need to pass before merging a change.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/127039256/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/127039563","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/953#issuecomment-127039563","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/953","id":127039563,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyNzAzOTU2Mw==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-02T15:58:11Z","updated_at":"2015-08-02T15:58:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks very nice!

The code includes Apache Ignite as a parameter server. Is it possible to make this independent of Ignite? I know that SSP is usually used in parameter server ML settings, but I would like to not tie Ignite (another big dependency) into the Flink codebase.\n\nI propose the following then:\n1. Move the code related to the parameter server (model + Ignite implementation) currently in flink-core to a separate module.\n2. Remove the parameter server startup code from the taskmanager.\n\nThis then implies that in order to use SSP and the parameter server the following needs to be done in the user job code:\n1. Include the parameter server module as dependency to the project.\n2. Start and stop the parameter server before and after each job.\n\nHow does that look for

are thinking about more general tooling for parameter servers (with implementations different from Ignite), because the request for that has come up. Whether we want to ship a parameter server with Flink, or simply add interfaces that help connecting against PS, is undecided, yet. \n\nFor that reason, we should probably not overdesign this now. Let's add SSP to the runtime, week Ignite out, and make a nice self-contained example where Ignite is purely used in the user-code.\n\nI think we can make a self-contained example in the following way:\nThe example MapFunction that communicates with the parameter server instantiates it's Ignite in the `open()` function, if it is in the first superstep. It then proceeds as in your code. \n\nTo make this real-world applicable, I assume one would need dedicated Ignite processes anyways. In the example, the parameters are lost after the server is torn down, but so are they with an \"in taskmanager parameter server\", for all users of YARN as well (where TMs are shut down after a job).\n\nThe example here serves the purpose of demonstrating the capabilities and use of SSP, and to give people a blueprint how to connect this to a parameter server.\n\nWhat do you think about this?\n\nHer are some other comments:\n- Using Longs as parameter IDs is probably quite a bit cheaper than Strings.\n- The pull request also still contains markup from merging.\n- Some constants are hard-wired into the code. Would be good to pull them into static final fields at least, so it is very visible that these are predefined constants.\n- You seem to re-initialize the caches in every superstep. In general, initialization in `open()` in iterations needs to be done carefully, because `open()` is called at the beginning of each superstep. You can always check in which superstep you are using `getIterationRuntimeContext().getCurrentSuperstep()`\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/127236312/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
