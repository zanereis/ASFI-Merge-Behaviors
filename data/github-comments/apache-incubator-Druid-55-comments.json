more interesting:\n\n> This release introduces beta support for the newly redesigned consumer client. At a high level, the\n> primary difference in the new consumer is that it removes the distinction between the “high-level”\n> ZooKeeper-based consumer and the “low-level” SimpleConsumer APIs, and instead offers a unified\n> consumer API.\n> \n> The new consumer allows the use of the group management facility (like the older high-level\n> consumer) while still offering better control over offset commits at the partition level (like the older low\n> level consumer). It offers pluggable partition assignment amongst the members of a consumer group\n> and ships with several assignment strategies. This completes a series of projects done in the last few\n> years to fully decouple Kafka clients from Zookeeper, thus entirely removing the consumer client’s\n> dependency on ZooKeeper.\n\ni.e. we finally can get a nice kafka-rt pipeline :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/171594182/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/171680863","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/2266#issuecomment-171680863","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2266","id":171680863,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MTY4MDg2Mw==","user":{"login":"anubhgup","id":6859038,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTkwMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6859038?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anubhgup","html_url":"https://github.com/anubhgup","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anubhgup/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anubhgup/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anubhgup/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anubhgup/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anubhgup/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anubhgup/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anubhgup/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anubhgup/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anubhgup/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-14T15:55:06Z","updated_at":"2016-01-14T15:55:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@navis @nishantmonu51 \n\nSome points in favour of this CL :)\n1.

The only benefit I can see is that it would reduce the number of nodes to scan when deciding which node to add to. It may also increase the number of znodes in theory, but I'm not sure any of those things matter in practice.\n\nI like that @navis added the new vs. existing node in the logs. Since we already merged the test into this PR, we can probably add the log message changes and merge @anubhgup's since he first reported this issue?
