Here's a brief rundown:\n- `uri` : What we will be using. Takes a flat data file and parses it with a parseSpec whose formats are supported as per the drui-api `ParseSpec`s. This one operates on a polling interval to look for a new data file to download.\n- `kafka`: This one instantly propagates changes.\n- `jdbc`: This one is only there because I kept getting requests to have a way to read the data through a jdbc connection. It function very similarly to the `uri` case except it pulls from a DB.\n\nThe question was if a kafka extension is really needed. It is the only way to instantly propagate a change through the cluster in the current collection of ways to propagate data. If that is deemed not required then it is pretty easy to pull out the extension.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/125353242/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/125421624","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/1569#issuecomment-125421624","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1569","id":125421624,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyNTQyMTYyNA==","user":{"login":"fjy","id":428325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODMyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy","html_url":"https://github.com/fjy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-28T03:21:43Z","updated_at":"2015-07-28T03:21:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks

Additionally, if you find something about the way that druid packages things that breaks aether or maven specifications, then I would also be very interested in knowing about it.\n\nFor releases, the procedure at https://github.com/druid-io/oss-parent  is followed.\n\nUnfortunately, external aether clients cannot be supported unless there's something that Druid is doing that breaks a specification. Closing until there is more evidence that there is a problem with the druid build system. At which point this should most definitely be reopened.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/126110168/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/126158176","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/1512#issuecomment-126158176","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1512","id":126158176,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyNjE1ODE3Ng==","user":{"login":"himanshug","id":246308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjMwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug","html_url":"https://github.com/himanshug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-30T01:59:29Z","updated_at":"2015-07-30T01:59:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"another failure in same\n\n```\nio.druid.client.BrokerServerViewTest.testMultipleServerAddedRemovedSegment\njava.lang.AssertionError: null\n    at org.junit.Assert.fail(Assert.java:86)\n    at org.junit.Assert.assertTrue(Assert.java:41)\n    at org.junit.Assert.assertTrue(Assert.java:52)\n    at io.druid.client.BrokerServerViewTest.__CLR4_0_0h9p6yz82e(BrokerServerViewTest.java:206)\n    at io.druid.client.BrokerServerViewTest.testMultipleServerAddedRemovedSegment(BrokerServerViewTest.java:154)\n```\n\nLog\n\n```\n2015-07-29T03:33:47,496 INFO [Thread-10] org.apache.zookeeper.server.ZooKeeperServerMain - Starting server\n2015-07-29T03:33:47,496 INFO [Thread-10] org.apache.zookeeper.server.ZooKeeperServer - tickTime set to 3000\n2015-07-29T03:33:47,496 INFO [Thread-10] org.apache.zookeeper.server.ZooKeeperServer - minSessionTimeout set to -1\n2015-07-29T03:33:47,496 INFO [Thread-10] org.apache.zookeeper.server.ZooKeeperServer - maxSessionTimeout set to -1\n2015-07-29T03:33:47,497 INFO [Thread-10] org.apache.zookeeper.server.NIOServerCnxnFactory - binding to port 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0:44924\n2015-07-29T03:33:48,499 WARN [main] org.apache.curator.CuratorZookeeperClient - session timeout [2000] is less than connection timeout [10000]\n2015-07-29T03:33:48,500 INFO [main] org.apache.curator.framework.imps.CuratorFrameworkImpl - Starting\n2015-07-29T03:33:48,500 INFO [main] org.apache.zookeeper.ZooKeeper - Initiating client connection, connectString=127.0.0.1:44924 sessionTimeout=2000 watcher=org.apache.curator.ConnectionState@5eed0dcc\n2015-07-29T03:33:48,501 INFO [main-SendThread(127.0.0.1:44924)] org.apache.zookeeper.ClientCnxn - Opening socket connection to server 127.0.0.1/127.0.0.1:44924.
