There we test the `date`/`timestamp`/`timestamp withzone` - same as in TestExpressionToSearchArgument. Might be useful for add tests with all of the `FileFormat`-s, but my feeling is that it should be tested on the individual FileFormats, and not here.\r\n- We test the individual conversion in the `TestHiveIcebergFilterFactory`. I am not fan of this test as it is basically inverting the `microsFromTimestamp(Timestamp timestamp)` method, and only testing if `timestamp.toLocalDateTime()` is working correctly or not 😄 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/788078056/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/788079096","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2278#issuecomment-788079096","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2278","id":788079096,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4ODA3OTA5Ng==","user":{"login":"pvary","id":19705742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzA1NzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19705742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary","html_url":"https://github.com/pvary","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-01T16:21:45Z","updated_at":"2021-03-01T16:21:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@shardulm94: Could you please review this PR?

(Is it not written, i.e., is null? or is it 0?)\r\nIn general, if we see a schema id of 0, does that ever represent a specific schema, or does that always represent some undetermined schema? Let me elaborate: (1) Will we ever see a `schema-id` of 0 in a metadata file and if so, does that refer to a unique schema?
