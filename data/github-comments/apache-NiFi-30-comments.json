The concerning thing here is that we need to make sure that any Processor, Controller Service, Reporting task that does support dynamic properties actually has the @DynamicProperty annotation. The annotation was placed in the 'org.apache.nifi.annotation.behavior' package instead of 'org.apache.nifi.annotation.documentation' package, I believe, so that we can do this sort of thing.\n\nHowever, thus far, we have not enforced it, and we need to ensure that we do not break backward compatibility. Doing a quick search of the codebase for \"getSupportedDynamicPropertyDescriptor\" shows that there are at least a couple of processors that do not have the @DynamicProperty annotation that should. At a minimum, we should address those.\n\nI do have some hesitation, though, that this could potentially break custom processors in the same way, by no longer allowing users to add their own properties.\n\n@joewitt @mcgilman or any others have any thoughts on this?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/243429171/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/243433985","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/969#issuecomment-243433985","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/969","id":243433985,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MzQzMzk4NQ==","user":{"login":"mcgilman","id":123395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzM5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman","html_url":"https://github.com/mcgilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-30T13:13:25Z","updated_at":"2016-08-30T13:13:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"My only concern is the potential confusion over the API itself. This is currently driven by `getSupportedDynamicPropertyDescriptor` which can conditionally support a user defined property. The method is provided the property name that the user entered and it's responsible for generating the `PropertyDescriptor` for it. Because of this, the UI really can never know if dynamic properties should be supported.\n\nThe `@DynamicProperty` annotation was added to assist with documentation. We could take a firmer stance and require the annotation but that could result in conflicting implementations (override `getSupportedDynamicPropertyDescriptor` but not adding `@DynamicProperty`) as @markap14 has pointed out. Once we've established this requirement however, we'd ultimately be better off as we'd be sure that the dynamic properties are documented. Because of this, I am in favor of the change though I also share the hesitation of breaking existing custom processors and when/how we can safely introduce

I did the same test for input port, too, got the same behavior.\n\n### 'retrieve site-to-site details' policy\n1. OK: Without NiFi.Q group: RPG can't retrieve site-to-site info [1]\n2. OK: With NiFi.Q group: RPG can retrieve site-to-site info, but since NiFi.Q is not allowed to access NiFi.P's port, it can't see any port [2]\n\n### 'send data via site-to-site' policy\n1. OK: Without NiFi.Q group: NiFi.Q can't see any port [2]\n2. OK: With NiFi.Q group: NiFi.Q can see the output port [3]\n3. OK: By enabling transmission, NiFi.Q can receive data from the output port [4]\n4. What if the NiFi.Q group is removed from this policy at this point? NiFi.Q started receiving 403, but no indication on the UI, other than the read warning mark on the relationship [5] Adding NiFi.Q group to the policy recovers data transfer. [6]\n5. How about RAW socket? \"User not authorized\" error is shown on bulletin board, output port reports error, too [7]\n\n### Result\n\nConfirmed that this PR relaxes SiteToSiteResource authorization check, and addresses policy setting issue reported by [NIFI-2550](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-2550).\n\nBy doing step, 4 and 5, I noticed there's a difference on the UI in terms of how NiFi UI reports auth error to end user.

Are there javascript errors in your browser? Are you familiar with browser debugging tools?  When you open the state dialog, there should be an XHR call to the server to get this state information, something like:\n\nhttp://localhost:8080/nifi-api/processors/dc5e91e6-0156-1000-ef9e-9d07ae89516c/state\n\nAnd this returns JSON with the state in it.  Can you check if that query is being run, and if it is failing or returning nothing?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/244422627/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/244428388","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/917#issuecomment-244428388","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/917","id":244428388,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NDQyODM4OA==","user":{"login":"gresockj","id":423565,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMzU2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/423565?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gresockj","html_url":"https://github.com/gresockj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gresockj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gresockj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gresockj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gresockj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gresockj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gresockj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gresockj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gresockj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gresockj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-02T16:49:10Z","updated_at":"2016-09-02T16:49:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yes, it's requesting this:\nhttps://localhost:8443/nifi-api/controller/process-groups/66ef7ae5-4bdb-4c50-9811-429be759f6fb/processors/7738f82e-d185-3931-a98e-c1156cd21cbc/state\n\ntotalEntryCount is 0 for both clusterState and localState\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/244428388/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/244431902","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/917#issuecomment-244431902","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/917","id":244431902,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NDQzMTkwMg==","user":{"login":"jvwing","id":3151078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTEwNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3151078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing","html_url":"https://github.com/jvwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-02T17:03:09Z","updated_at":"2016-09-02T17:03:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Are you running a cluster?
