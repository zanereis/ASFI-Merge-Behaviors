date is a keyword in calcite parsing, and calcite does not process the keywords, it causes parsing exceptions. Using quotation marks or rename can temporarily avoid this problem. Later, calcite parsing will be skipped and shardingsphere parsing will be used directly.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nselect s.content from t_single s inner join t_order_test t ON s.single_id = t.test_id WHERE 'date' = '2021-09-14';\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/918938050/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/918940633","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/11794#issuecomment-918940633","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/11794","id":918940633,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAvkN_M42xevZ","user":{"login":"strongduanmu","id":10829171,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODI5MTcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10829171?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/strongduanmu","html_url":"https://github.com/strongduanmu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strongduanmu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strongduanmu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strongduanmu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strongduanmu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strongduanmu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strongduanmu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strongduanmu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strongduanmu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strongduanmu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-14T08:40:50Z","updated_at":"2021-09-14T09:50:19Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"When I tested, I found another problem, that is, calcite has problems with time processing. \r\n\r\n```sql\r\nmysql> insert into t_single(single_id, content, date) values(1, '11', '2021-09-14');\r\nQuery OK, 1 row affected (0.03 sec)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI executed the following SQL and inserted a record with the date `2021-09-14` into the t_single table, but when I query it through calcite, it returns `2021-09-13`.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nmysql> select * from t_single s inner join t_order_test t ON s.single_id = t.test_id;\r\n+---------+------------+-----------+----------+---------+\r\n| content | date       | single_id | content0 | test_id |\r\n+---------+------------+-----------+----------+---------+\r\n| 11      | 2021-09-13 |         1 | 11       |       1 |\r\n+---------+------------+-----------+----------+---------+\r\n\r\nmysql> select * from t_single s inner join t_order_test t ON s.single_id = t.test_id WHERE create_date_time = '2021-09-14';\r\nERROR 2013 (HY000): Lost connection to MySQL server during query\r\nNo connection.
