I tried but ran into issues with `Precondition` class conflict when querying a Hudi table with metadata enabled. And we cannot upgrade directly because HBase depends on a particular version of guava that is used by hadoop (more specifically hadoop-common). When we upgrade to Hadoop 3 then guava will automatically get upgraded to version 27 which is compatible with that in Presto.

Even when you think you read from metastore, it fall back reading hudi by path. Then if you don't have a metadata table enabled, it get's the partition from scanning the whole table on filesystem. which is rather slow and costly.
