Thank you for quick update. \nI have two more comments.\n\nFirst, as you know, there is a problem of precision of floating numbers. We can simply ignore this problem until we support decimal or numeric types.\n\nSecond, I think that it would be nicer and easier to comprehend the overall logic related to tablespace if you separate its implementation. More specifically, in the current implementation, Tablespace is a single class, and contains information about itself and provides some functionalities to interact with underlying storage. This makes the implementation quite complicated. So, how about separating it into Tablespace and TablespaceHandler? I'm just suggesting you, and you don't have to do it in this ticket even though you agree. Maybe it causes huge changes.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/140642251/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/140759719","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/652#issuecomment-140759719","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/652","id":140759719,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MDc1OTcxOQ==","user":{"login":"hyunsik","id":225941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/225941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik","html_url":"https://github.com/hyunsik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-16T14:31:51Z","updated_at":"2015-09-16T14:31:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"+1\n\nBefore commiting the patch, I slightly changed as follows\n- `INVALID_CAST` to `INVALID_VALUE_FOR_CAST`\n- Add SQLState for `INVALID_VALUE_FOR_CAST` to `SQLExceptionUtil`\n- Add an map entry for `INVALID_VALUE_FOR_CAST` to `ExceptionUtil`\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/140759719/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/140762095","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/652#issuecomment-140762095","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/652","id":140762095,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MDc2MjA5NQ==","user":{"login":"hyunsik","id":225941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/225941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik","html_url":"https://github.com/hyunsik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-16T14:41:08Z","updated_at":"2015-09-16T14:41:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thank you for your work.

@jinossy and @hyunsik, both points look reasonable to me. \nEven though we use FileTablespace as the default handler when the handler is not found, Hadoop's FileSystem implementation will emit an error of `No FileSystem for scheme: [uri_scheme]`.\nIn some sense, this error will be more useful for users than `tablespace '/path/to/table' does not exist`.\nOn the other hand, I'm also concerned with unexpected behaviours due to some other bugs if we don't handle exceptions about Tablespace by ourselves.\n\nWhat do you

Also HiveCatalogStore support the method restrictedly. You can see the grammar for hive partition api to https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/master/metastore/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/metastore/parser/Filter.g. But I think that we need the method for user convenience. So I'll implement at another jira issue using tajo-sql-parser module and `CatalogStore::getPartitionsByAlgebra`.\n- **Allow invalid partition directory name**: When adding partition using alter statement, users can set partition path freely. But current PartitionedTableRewriter just allow well-defined partition directory which consists of column name and partition value. So if users use invalid partition directory name, they can scan their partitions. To resolve above situation, I added list of PartitionDescProto to PartitionedTableScanNode.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/142674077/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/142754055","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/779#issuecomment-142754055","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/779","id":142754055,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0Mjc1NDA1NQ==","user":{"login":"hyunsik","id":225941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/225941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik","html_url":"https://github.com/hyunsik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-23T22:52:06Z","updated_at":"2015-09-23T22:52:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"+1\nI've tested it.
