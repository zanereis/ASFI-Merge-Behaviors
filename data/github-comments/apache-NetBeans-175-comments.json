what do you think about splitting the question if the used ejb spec is technical compatible vs functional compatible?\r\n\r\nLike `TechnicalEJBCompatibility` vs `FunctionalEJBCompatibility` where things could be handled differently.\r\n\r\nBig picture: I want to lower the maintenance efforts needs to be done by a maintainer / contributor. Fact is that some enterprise features are broken (like the missing button) based on the fact that a new method was introduced to `J2eeProjectCapabilities`, but the calls to the `isEjbXX` was not analyzed. So NetBeans interpreted this that EJB 4 does not provide the same functionality as EJB 3.1. When we'd assume that a new EJB release is backward compatible - like most of the time - we would not run in that situation. With EJB 4 it might create wrong namespaces, but at least the features are not completely absent / broken. Don't know if `J2eeProjectCapabilities` is the right place to do that. But from my point of view assuming that a new release is backward compatible is much more likely than assuming a maintainer / contributor will add new Jakarta EE releases on all necessary places (as this is the reason why the features are fully broken).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1657100710/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1657180335","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/3962#issuecomment-1657180335","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/3962","id":1657180335,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5ixpCv","user":{"login":"istinnstudio","id":36081997,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDgxOTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36081997?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/istinnstudio","html_url":"https://github.com/istinnstudio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/istinnstudio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/istinnstudio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/istinnstudio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/istinnstudio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/istinnstudio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/istinnstudio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/istinnstudio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/istinnstudio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/istinnstudio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-30T13:57:07Z","updated_at":"2023-07-30T13:57:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I really do not know what to think, using multiple copy/paste sessions in the era of ai is so common that this bug is a real pain to handle with the current workarounds.
