IE the critical path of the pipeline continues until a terminal event occurs. This allows you to see the entire duration clearly.\n\nThis implies the root span isn't closed immediately when it sent something to a broker, rather it is left open until a terminal event occurs. Something down the line will close it.\n1. Report a start annotation in the root span like \"pipeline.begin\" or similar\n2. When going across a broker, propagate the root span id as baggage and report \"ms\" in the current span.\n3. When receiving from a broker, extract the current span and report \"mr\"; extract the root span id from baggage and propagate in process\n4. repeat 2, 3 as necessary\n5.

Please review as soon as you can, as the final wave of this effort is nearly complete.\n\nParticularly, @michaelsembwever @mansu @basvanbeek and @shakuzen please review the below if you can, and let me know if there's anything about the name or description that seems confusing.\n\n---\n\n`StorageComponent.Builder.upgradingTo128BitTraceId(boolean upgradingTo128BitTraceId)`\n\nZipkin supports 64 and 128-bit trace identifiers, typically serialized as 16 or 32 character hex strings. When true, this setting only considers the low 64-bits (right-most 16 characters) of a trace ID when grouping or retrieving traces. This should be enabled when transitioning from 64 to 128-bit trace IDs and disabled after the transition is complete.\n\n### Details\n\nZipkin historically had 64-bit trace IDs, but it now supports 128-bit trace IDs via `Span.traceIdHigh`, or its 32-character hex representation. While instrumentation update to propagate 128-bit IDs, it can be ambiguous whether a 64-bit trace ID was sent intentionally, or as an accident of truncation. This setting allows Zipkin to be usable until application instrumentation are upgraded to support 128-bit trace IDs.\n\nHere are a few trace IDs the help explain this setting.\n- Trace ID A: 463ac35c9f6413ad48485a3953bb6124\n- Trace ID B: 48485a3953bb6124\n- Trace ID C: 463ac35c9f6413adf1a48a8cff464e0e\n- Trace ID D: 463ac35c9f6413ad\n\nIn the above example, Trace ID A and Trace ID B might mean they are in the same trace, since the lower-64 bits of the IDs are the same. This could happen if a server A created the trace and propagated it to server B which ran an older tracing library. Server B could have truncated the trace ID to lower-64 bits. When `upgradingTo128BitTraceId == true`, spans matching either trace ID A or B would be returned in the same trace when searching by ID A or B. Spans with trace ID C or D wouldn't be when searching by ID A or B because trace IDs C and D don't share lower 64-bits (right-most 16 characters) with trace IDs A or B.\n\nIt is also possible that all servers are capable of handling 128-bit trace identifiers, but are configured to only send 64-bit ones. In this case, if `upgradingTo128BitTraceId == true` trace ID A and B would clash and be put into the same trace, causing confusion. Moreover, there is overhead associated with indexing spans both by 64 and 128-bit trace IDs. When a site has finished upgrading to 128-bit trace IDs, they should disable this setting.\n\nSee https://github.com/openzipkin/b3-propagation/issues/6 for the status of known open source libraries on 128-bit trace identifiers.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/259043155/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/259049193","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1298#issuecomment-259049193","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1298","id":259049193,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1OTA0OTE5Mw==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-08T05:27:41Z","updated_at":"2016-11-08T05:27:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"one more bikeshed concern is the name of the parameter being described, particularly as we need to describe it as configuration potentially to non-english speakers.\n- upgradingTo128BitTraceId - describes well the act, but it is long and is lengthy converted to snake or upper underscore case\n- stepDownTraceIds - implies \"stepping down\" from 128 to 64-bit, which is a bit jargony.
