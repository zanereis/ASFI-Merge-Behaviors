In brief what happens is this;\r\n\r\n - LoanTransaction has a OneToMany relationship with LoanTransactionToRepaymentScheduleMapping\r\n - LoanTransactionToRepaymentScheduleMapping has in turn a ManyToOne relationship with LoanRepaymentScheduleInstallment.\r\n - When I hit LoanTransaction.save(loanTransaction), the LoanRepaymentScheduleInstallment get persisted, but the generated id of the persisted instance is not assigned to the corresponding column in LoanTransactionToRepaymentScheduleMapping so I repeatedly have this error:\r\n\"java.sql.SQLIntegrityConstraintViolationException: Column 'loan_repayment_schedule_id' cannot be null\" which I believe means the id of LoanRepaymentScheduleInstallment is not added to LoanTransactionToRepaymentScheduleMapping hence tests fails.\r\n\r\nThis same error also applies to every other test that deals with writing LoanTransactions(there are about 16 of them).\r\n\r\nI've tried a couple of things;\r\n - Used: CascadeType.ALL, CascadeType.PERSIST, FetchType.LAZY.\r\n - Also tried breaking down the transaction from a save to small for loops where I saved and assigned the ids manually and weirdly that didn't work either.\r\n\r\nA bit of assistance with this will be very welcome.

I  am actually adding clients, so there would be some clients in the database for sure. (Check the first for loop).\r\n> 2. I am adding 15 clients and each time I am assigning him pending or active status randomly, that means\r\n> \r\n> The probability that there are no active/pending clients = 1/pow(2,15) = 0.00003051757, I hope you will agree we can ignore this and consider that there is at least one active/pending client.\r\n\r\nNo that wasn't my concern - I know you create active and pending clients. My concern was: what if the query selection doesn't work as expected, and instead returns an empty list without matching any clients? I don't see the test checking for the case where there is no clients returned - it just checks that whatever clients are returned are in the correct status. \r\n\r\nSo something like assertNotEquals(list.size(), 0) for both cases...\r\n\r\n> 1. The client status never actually becomes invalid, it just means that there is no such status. In that case, we as you said we can either give an exception or show all entries.\r\n>    @ptuomola as you said, should we instead throw an exception? still confused or we should instead show all the clients if it does not map to any of them.\r\n\r\nMy personal view would be that we should throw an exception if the caller sends a status that is not a valid value for ClientStatus. Otherwise the caller thinks that there are no clients matching this status and never finds out that they actually sent the wrong value. Empty list should mean that there are no matches. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/668755830/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/668759682","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/1207#issuecomment-668759682","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/1207","id":668759682,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2ODc1OTY4Mg==","user":{"login":"thesmallstar","id":42006277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMDA2Mjc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42006277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar","html_url":"https://github.com/thesmallstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-04T18:38:39Z","updated_at":"2020-08-04T18:38:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@ptuomola thank you so much for the quick response!\r\nI got it now, updating it now.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/668759682/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/669198438","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/1207#issuecomment-669198438","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/1207","id":669198438,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2OTE5ODQzOA==","user":{"login":"thesmallstar","id":42006277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMDA2Mjc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42006277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar","html_url":"https://github.com/thesmallstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-05T13:37:51Z","updated_at":"2020-08-05T13:37:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@ptuomola I have updated this as you suggested, the tests are running for hours now idk why.

I thought the idea here was that the actual argument (jsonRequestBody) is hidden, and instead a \"pseudo-argument\" is created with the correct schema type using the @Parameter annotation above the function signature:\r\n\r\n@Parameter(required = true, schema = @Schema(implementation = AccrualAccountingApiResourceSwagger.PostRunaccrualsRequest.class, description = \"Request Body\\n\"\r\n            + \"\\n\" + \"Field Descriptions: \\n\" + \"tillDate: \\n\" + \"which specifies periodic accruals should happen till the given Date\"))\r\n\r\nSo I suppose how this should work is that Swagger would then take the schema from this annotation but send the serialised object as the request body (instead of requiring you to type the jsonRequestBody specifically).

So the problem seems to be that in this one, the request body was annotated with @Parameter whereas in all the others it is annotated with @RequestBody. I found another one that is similarly broken: JournalEntriesApiResource.createGLJournalEntry().\r\n\r\nSo in my view we should make this consistent with the others - i.e. use RequestBody. I will raise a PR to fix - if you can review to see if it makes sense to you, and then I can merge it. Was there a JIRA ticket for this already?\r\n\r\nThanks for looking into this!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/673945067/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/673945380","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/1237#issuecomment-673945380","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/1237","id":673945380,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3Mzk0NTM4MA==","user":{"login":"ptuomola","id":2398858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzOTg4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2398858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola","html_url":"https://github.com/ptuomola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-14T08:00:38Z","updated_at":"2020-08-14T08:00:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@thesmallstar PR #1247 - can you have a look?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/673945380/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/673975607","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/1207#issuecomment-673975607","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/1207","id":673975607,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3Mzk3NTYwNw==","user":{"login":"ptuomola","id":2398858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzOTg4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2398858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola","html_url":"https://github.com/ptuomola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-14T09:09:32Z","updated_at":"2020-08-14T09:09:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@thesmallstar Finally had a chance to look at this and to test it out locally. The functionality itself works as expected - great work! \r\n\r\nThe only concern I have is: I really don't like the fact that we need to maintain two lists of ClientStatus values - one in the enum itself, another one in the validator. It's really easy for these to get out of synch: in fact they have already done so, as there's a spelling mistake in the validator (\"transfer_in_progreess\") which doesn't match the validator.\r\n\r\nGiven this, maybe the right thing to do after all is to use the ClientStatus enum itself to validate? I.e. call the fromString method to validate, and throw an error if you get ClientStatus.INVALID? I know that doesn't allow you to search for values that actually have the status INVALID, but I don't think that's a valid status in the first place - so we should not have any such records anyway.\r\n\r\nDoes that make sense? That would allow us to remove the arrayList of valid values, but otherwise keep the functionality intact. What do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/673975607/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/674151867","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/1211#issuecomment-674151867","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/1211","id":674151867,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3NDE1MTg2Nw==","user":{"login":"avikganguly01","id":4125030,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjUwMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4125030?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/avikganguly01","html_url":"https://github.com/avikganguly01","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avikganguly01/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avikganguly01/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avikganguly01/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avikganguly01/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avikganguly01/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avikganguly01/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avikganguly01/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avikganguly01/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avikganguly01/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-14T16:18:18Z","updated_at":"2020-08-14T16:18:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Deadlock for financial activity type is being caused by a different flaky test and it seems to happen rarely, even in the absence of this PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/674151867/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
