Not sure if this might be in some other issue?\r\n\r\n- With regards to changing the back end: we are unsure. The json output has a `path` value under annotations that includes the package name, and it seems easy to grab the `packageName/entityName` from it. We're not sure if it's better to use that information to create the name, or to change the backend to give us the name beforehand.

The motivation for this PR is so that deployments that do not want to rely on Ansible. For example, in Kubernetes you would could have a number Pods deployed for the Invoker (say 5), but you want to increase that number to 10.  The way one would normally do this is running `kubectl scale --replicas=10 -f <PATH TO YAML FILE>` (or some other way, update required yaml and reapply it).\r\n\r\nHowever, the current workflow would require us to run the Kafka topic creation before those components come up. I image that other deployment strategies like Docker Compose could have this issue as well.\r\n\r\nLastly, the issue with versioning, I think I can set environment variables in gradle that can feed into the Docker images, need to test it out. Or since both the Controller and Invoker use the same base image, we could create a new Docker image that has Kafka built into it, then use that image for the Controller and Invoker, but not sure if you want another Docker Image.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/319095709/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/319136319","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/2452#issuecomment-319136319","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/2452","id":319136319,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxOTEzNjMxOQ==","user":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-31T17:26:45Z","updated_at":"2017-07-31T17:26:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"pg3/934

@mdeuser, @dubeejw : I have a suggested change for Alphabetize. \r\n\r\nCurrently, to order alphabetically, we use the order flag as a bool: `wsk action list --order`. However, with APIs in particular, you have to qualify if you want to sort by action name, or by `Base path`/`Rel path`/`Verb`. This means an additional flag: either something like `wsk api list --order --orderAction`, or `wsk api list --orderAction` for action names, and `wsk api list --order` for the normal sorting. \r\n\r\nWe think we can get more mileage out of passing a string through the `--order` flag instead of it being a bool. Example: `wsk api list --order Alpha` or `wsk api list --order A` to sort alphabetically the usual way, versus `wsk api list --order AlphaAction` or `wsk api list --order N` to sort alphabetically by action name. \r\n\r\nWhat were your thoughts on this? In particular: is this a good idea, and if so, what proper naming convention should we set? This could be beneficial later on to have this in place when we want to expand how users could sort a list.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/319177053/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/319181705","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/2326#issuecomment-319181705","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/2326","id":319181705,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxOTE4MTcwNQ==","user":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-31T20:08:59Z","updated_at":"2017-07-31T20:08:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Wasn't
