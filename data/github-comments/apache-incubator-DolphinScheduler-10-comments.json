So I chose a way of making the least impact changes.\r\n> Can the official commiters give some advice?\r\n\r\nHi, Gary, I think pre-statement should mostly used to setup environment for the main SQL. so, it is used mainly for: like setup locale, setup timezone, drop some partition, create partition if not exists, etc.  In most case, I don't think we need to refer to UDF in those pre-Statement. \r\n\r\nI added those \"pre-statement\", and \"post statement\" support, so I think it is fine to change pre-statement to run before register UDFs.  So, I think you can go ahead and change that and make a Pull request. Thanks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/544773803/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/544778091","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/586#issuecomment-544778091","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/586","id":544778091,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NDc3ODA5MQ==","user":{"login":"coding-now","id":26567069,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTY3MDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26567069?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coding-now","html_url":"https://github.com/coding-now","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coding-now/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coding-now/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coding-now/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coding-now/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coding-now/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coding-now/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coding-now/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coding-now/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coding-now/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-22T02:01:30Z","updated_at":"2019-10-22T02:01:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"用户登录部分，前端也是密码明文传输","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/544778091/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/544841120","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/121#issuecomment-544841120","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/121","id":544841120,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NDg0MTEyMA==","user":{"login":"phoenixhadoop","id":6349573,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNDk1NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6349573?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phoenixhadoop","html_url":"https://github.com/phoenixhadoop","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phoenixhadoop/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phoenixhadoop/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phoenixhadoop/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phoenixhadoop/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phoenixhadoop/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phoenixhadoop/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phoenixhadoop/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phoenixhadoop/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phoenixhadoop/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-22T07:37:31Z","updated_at":"2019-10-22T07:37:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"+1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/544841120/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/544846921","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/57#issuecomment-544846921","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/57","id":544846921,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NDg0NjkyMQ==","user":{"login":"ShiXiaoQiangGitHub","id":19661512,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjYxNTEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19661512?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShiXiaoQiangGitHub","html_url":"https://github.com/ShiXiaoQiangGitHub","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShiXiaoQiangGitHub/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShiXiaoQiangGitHub/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShiXiaoQiangGitHub/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShiXiaoQiangGitHub/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShiXiaoQiangGitHub/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShiXiaoQiangGitHub/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShiXiaoQiangGitHub/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShiXiaoQiangGitHub/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShiXiaoQiangGitHub/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-22T07:56:53Z","updated_at":"2019-

+1, I agree with your design. I also think of a few additional points here:\r\n1. Task plug-in development, there are two points to consider, one is a plug-in that allows users to directly develop their own business needs, and the use is more flexible; the other is to allow open source enthusiasts to develop third-party plug-ins, so that will promote the development of dolphinscheduler, ideas are more divergent, is there a plug-in market? Therefore, based on the function of the custom task plug-in, it is necessary to support the third-party plug-in import. After the import and the custom task plug-in is a process, the workload itself is not large, but the import is added on the basis of the original.\r\n2. Plug-in development does not depend on java, can be any language, executable program, the scheduling platform does is transparent transmission parameters, execution and scheduling. Developers can have more choices. For example, a shell script can be packaged into a plugin using some parameters. For example， someone can write an executable file in golang, define some parameters, to make a plugin.\r\n3. System upgrade or migration is also a point to note, to ensure that the plug-in will still take effect after migration or upgrade.\r\n-----\r\n@gaojun2048 +1 很赞同你的需求，我这边还想到几个补充的点：\r\n1、任务插件化开发，可以有两点考虑，一个是让使用者直接可以开发自己业务需求的插件，使用上更加灵活；另一个是可以让开源爱好者开发第三方插件，这样对ds更是一种正向的推动，思路更发散点，是不是可以有插件market。\r\n所以在自定义任务插件的功能基础上，要支持第三方插件导入，导入后和自定义任务插件是一个流程，这个工作量本身并不大，只是在原来的基础上增加了导入。\r\n2、自定义任务插件，可以不局限于jar包，可以是shell, python, 也可以是一个可执行文件，可以有更多的选择。比如说一个shell脚本使用一些参数，就可以封装成一个插件；同时也可以用golang写一个可执行文件，传到服务器，定义一些入参，也可以作为一个插件。\r\n3、系统升级或者迁移也是个要注意的点，要保证迁移或者升级后，插件依然能够生效。","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/545028146/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/545727902","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/pull/970#issuecomment-545727902","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/970","id":545727902,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NTcyNzkwMg==","user":{"login":"break60","id":28628088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NjI4MDg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28628088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/break60","html_url":"https://github.com/break60","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/break60/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/break60/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/break60/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/break60/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/break60/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/break60/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/break60/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/break60/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/break60/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-24T03:33:58Z","updated_at":"2019-10-24T03:33:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":">
