The alternative would be to write a visitor that can adds this information and is run from StaticCompilationVisitor, to let the actual adding of those methods be done by the StaticCompilationVisitor later on. But actually the list of inner classes in the classnode is supposed to contain all inner classes at this stage, so I am not sure you even need a full blown visitor for this.

Would it make sense to also define a `bufferedIterator` method on `Iterable` so you could do something like `[1,2].bufferedIterator`?\n2. Since it's an extension of the `Iterator` interface would it make sense to also define this new type `groovy.util.BufferedIterator` as an Interface with the implementation used by `DefaultGroovyMethods` coming from `org.codehaus.groovy.util`?  Don't have a compelling reason for this since I doubt there'd been too many implementation of it, just tend to prefer interfaces for new types rather than concrete classes but this could be considered more a wrapper than new type.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/176358381/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/176375965","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/247#issuecomment-176375965","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/247","id":176375965,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3NjM3NTk2NQ==","user":{"login":"ataylor284","id":288078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4ODA3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/288078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ataylor284","html_url":"https://github.com/ataylor284","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ataylor284/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ataylor284/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ataylor284/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ataylor284/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ataylor284/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ataylor284/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ataylor284/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ataylor284/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ataylor284/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-28T19:56:56Z","updated_at":"2016-01-28T19:56:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Good point.

@oreissig,\n\nI like it and created a jira entry for this enhancement: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GROOVY-7745\n\nIt would be very nice if you could also add an example to the javadoc like Map#each(Closure) etc.\n\nThanks,\nPascal\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/179469608/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/179478069","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/247#issuecomment-179478069","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/247","id":179478069,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3OTQ3ODA2OQ==","user":{"login":"PascalSchumacher","id":2707245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDcyNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2707245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher","html_url":"https://github.com/PascalSchumacher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-03T21:26:08Z","updated_at":"2016-02-03T21:26:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"jira
