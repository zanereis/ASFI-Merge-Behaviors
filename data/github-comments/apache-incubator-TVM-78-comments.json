The culprit is IEEE floating point rounding rules. The solution requires special hardware which is available as of Dec 2017, and we are trying to incorporate this hw into VTA. The benefit is significant: an 8-bit posit beats a 32-bit IEEE float in terms of training accuracy. And since most models are memory bound, we get a big boost in performance as well.

I believe we should also include a `-Fpass` style mechanism to enable and disable individual passes as well. The current build_config interface doesn't allow us to fully remove, add, and order passes. \r\n\r\nParticularly I feel reaching consensus and moving forward soon would be good. @zhiics has been blocked on our discussion and the lack of a manger. \r\n\r\nI caught @tqchen for an in-person chat at the end of last week, and will summarize the results of our conversation below.\r\n\r\nIn the interest of moving forward  with the pass manager I think we should all weigh this update, and move towards an implementation. My recommendation is that we do it in two pieces first adding a simple manager, a pass wrapper class, and the basic pass signature and registration in an initial PR.\r\n\r\nThen follow up with a secondary PR in which we convert all existing passes to work in this style, and provide user facing APIs for writing & registering passes. \r\n\r\n@tqchen wants to standardize on a single pass signature that is shared across all passes, and his ideal signature is `Module -> Module` the challenge with this signature is how to share state across passes. In general I think stateless passes are good, but traditional compilers often share state between passes.  Tianqi commented that we have avoided sharing any state in our current set of passes and will not be a problem. \r\n\r\nThe concern I continued to raise during our conversation is that if we commit to this signature and *do* need to share state it will be challenging, and painful to readapt the code. We can of course write mini-passes that explicitly share state, but lose the ability to treat them as independent passes from the pass manager's point of view.\r\n\r\nWe also discussed whether we should have a `Pass` class or not. My feeling is whether we expose this interface to the user or not we should internally store a pass class which wraps a pass function with the required meta-data. I think we can address @FrozenGene's concern by accepting functions which match the pass signature in the interface.\r\n\r\nAfter thinking about it over the weekend I'm further convinced that we need more state than a  module to do even simple things like descriptive errors.\r\n\r\nFor example if we make use of span based errors (yet to be implemented) we need to carry around the source map, a piece of state not accounted for in this design. Even in the current error reporting we must know both the module, and function we are in, which are contained in the module, but this may not always be the case.\r\n\r\nIn the world where we have a `Module -> Module` signature users can manually construct an error reporter, but this does not provide an abstraction, all pass authors must understand how to correctly initialize and use the reporting. The lack of abstraction provides us no means to expose a higher level API hiding details we may want to change for 3rd party pass authors. \r\n\r\nAsking users to manually configure what should be standard pieces of infrastructure increases the burden to build a pass.

These would setup up the pass with the appropriate state and allow use to take state while providing an easy to use interface that works over a single Module, or Expression.\r\n\r\nTo conclude I think we should reach consensus on an internal signature, not necessarily the API users will interact with in Python or C++, but how the pass will be defined, configured, and invoked by the manager. \r\n\r\nTo respond to @yzhliu I think for now everything we put in the state would be mutable, we could choose to make `realay::Module` immutable but currently modules and error reporting are some of the *only mutable* types in Relay. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/463004611/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/463005939","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2575#issuecomment-463005939","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2575","id":463005939,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MzAwNTkzOQ==","user":{"login":"slyubomirsky","id":5624871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MjQ4NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5624871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky","html_url":"https://github.com/slyubomirsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-13T00:45:30Z","updated_at":"2019-02-13T00:45:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@junrushao1994 if porting the RNN example to a functional style is giving you any trouble or taking too much of your time, it would be fine if you gave an imperative version; I would be more than happy to express it using folds.

The meta-data provides the declarative fashion to compose up things, just like nn.Module\r\n- The composed pass should, in turn, should expose the same signature ```Module->Module```\r\n\r\nThe main reason that I think we should have a clean unified signature(Module->Module) in the case of  ```__call__```, is that it provides a simple way for a user to try out things imperatively.\r\n\r\n## What if a Pass Need Other States\r\nFirst of all, we need to distinguish two kinds of requirements:\r\n- Context states: error reporter belongs to this category\r\n- Real information that needs to be passed.\r\n\r\nContext states are internal to each pass, and we just need to be able to quickly construct them when constructing pass functions, and provide utils to do smart error reporting.\r\n\r\nLet us see the case of real state information, consider the following case:\r\n```python\r\nmodule = relay.from_frontend(model)\r\naux_info = relay.ir_pass.some_aux_analysis(module)\r\ntransformed = relay.ir_pass.pass_func1(module, aux_info)\r\n```\r\n\r\n- In most of our current analysis, it suffices to fold aux_info and the pass_func1 together as a Pass. \r\n- Alternatively, we can declare in the pass function that the pass_func1 requires the additional aux information, and let the pass manager handles the call to aux_analysis.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of the second approach is it somehow enables sharing of aux_info if we can build that incrementally even after we change the module. On the other hand, atm we can simply rebuild things from scratch.\r\n\r\nIn both cases, regardless of which design we choose, we do not necessarily have to make the pass signature ```Module, Info->Module, Info```. Instead, the \"internal siganture\" could take ```Module, Info ->Module```` where the second or more argument indicates additional information requested. Since we cannot really enumerate this information at the moment.\r\n\r\nRegardless of what we do, I do think that from a high-level user should only care about Module->Module, this will make composition much cleaner, and avoids an additional concept burden(PassState) which can cause confusion in most cases\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/463042840/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/463047248","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/2401#issuecomment-463047248","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2401","id":463047248,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MzA0NzI0OA==","user":{"login":"luorixiangyang","id":8829635,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4Mjk2MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8829635?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/luorixiangyang","html_url":"https://github.com/luorixiangyang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luorixiangyang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luorixiangyang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luorixiangyang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luorixiangyang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luorixiangyang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luorixiangyang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luorixiangyang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luorixiangyang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luorixiangyang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-13T03:54:43Z","updated_at":"2019-02-13T03:54:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"+1

have reservation about this code change. It seems to me this is too much a cost of increased risk and code complexity for something not of too much practical value, e.g., number of bits exceeds max int32. You end up having code which uses int32 in one case and int64 in another? Super confusing! If number of bits exceeds max int32 you likely have other problem to worry about, like, unable to allocate memory that big.\r\n\r\nI suggest either this should be left not fixed. Or fix in more conservative way, like using unsigned int32 instead of signed, so you can have up to 4 billion bits. Or if you feel strongly about supporting more than 4 billion bits, uniformly use int64. Just don't have a mixed case of int32/int64 which is too risky.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/463331229/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/463341023","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2580#issuecomment-463341023","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2580","id":463341023,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MzM0MTAyMw==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-13T19:46:59Z","updated_at":"2019-02-13T19:46:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@Anthony-Mai has some point on this.

I think allocating more than 2G or even 4G memory on a 64-bit system should be okay. We have an usage that requires a large amount of memory. We are also probably going to test very large input images on some networks, where uint32 might not be enough.\r\n\r\nI am not sure if we need to use int64 all around the other places because it seems that VTA at least only uses int32, it would result in many casts. In addition, as per @yzhliu comment, we are warning the users here. I understand that using one consistent type is ideal, but casting as needed in this case is more like a small optimization.
