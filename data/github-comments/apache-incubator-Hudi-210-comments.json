Basically I want to understand the motivation behind introducing this PR.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to deal with data in binlog json format, but not very convenient.\r\n\r\n1. For maxwell(our company use it to capture changed data)\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"database\": \"test\",\r\n    \"table\": \"maxwell\",\r\n    \"type\": \"update\",\r\n    \"ts\": 1449786341,\r\n    \"xid\": 940786,\r\n    \"commit\": true,\r\n    \"data\": {\"id\":1, \"daemon\": \"Firebus!  Firebus!\",\"update_time\" : \"2022-02-03 12:22:42\"},\r\n    \"old\":  {\"daemon\": \"Stanislaw Lem\"}\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nall we want is just :\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"id\": 1, \r\n    \"daemon\": \"Firebus!  Firebus!\", \r\n    \"update_time\": \"2022-02-03 12:22:42\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nwe can add write a processor to extract the data from the entire json and maybe do some custom define process, without configuring a huge schema file(including all the fields in the binlog json, no matter if we need them or not)\r\n\r\n2. in some scenes, we need to encode some fileds for safety purpose, the processor can help us\r\n\r\n3. sometimes our data quality is not very well, some key field let's say precombine field have null value, we can use processor to fix it\r\n\r\n4. when our schema is read from jdbc or hive, we can use processor adjust our kafka data compatible to it. \r\n\r\nAll in all, with custom processor we can do anything we want on the incoming json data before they are converted into DataSet\r\nOf course `Transformer` is a very useful feature too, but it is based on Spark DataSet, and have certain requirements for data quality.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1059934053/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1059934145","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/4960#issuecomment-1059934145","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/4960","id":1059934145,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM4_LU_B","user":{"login":"MrSleeping123","id":75006165,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MDA2MTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/75006165?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrSleeping123","html_url":"https://github.com/MrSleeping123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrSleeping123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrSleeping123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrSleeping123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrSleeping123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrSleeping123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrSleeping123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrSleeping123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrSleeping123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrSleeping123/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-06T10:20:49Z","updated_at":"2022-03-06T10:20:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@xiarixiaoyao the CI report has been successful. pls help me review again when you are free. thank you very much.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1059934145/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1059936383","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/4930#issuecomment-1059936383","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/4930","id":1059936383,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM4_LVh_","user":{"login":"pratyakshsharma","id":30863489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwODYzNDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30863489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma","html_url":"https://github.com/pratyakshsharma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-06T10:35:14Z","updated_at":"2022-03-06T10:35:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Right.
