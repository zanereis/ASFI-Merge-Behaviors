Could you point me at an example of the problem?\r\n\r\nSo currently in my BYOC workflow, I'm using composite to match against quantized convolution and other elemwise ops following it, coming from pytorch frontend. But matching against it needs some optional \"holes\":\r\n\r\n* Depending on the padding size, an explicit pad op is required before qconv https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/blob/master/python/tvm/relay/frontend/qnn_torch.py#L485\r\n*  If there is an non zero bias, need to add bias_add op https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/blob/master/python/tvm/relay/frontend/qnn_torch.py#L429\r\n* If qconv is followed by relu, need to add another clip op\r\n\r\nAnother example that requires optional matching is hswish. Depending on whether or not this branch https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/blob/master/python/tvm/relay/frontend/qnn_torch.py#L661 is taken, hswish conversion can be either\r\n* clip -> qmul\r\n* requantize -> add -> clip -> cast -> clip -> qmul\r\n\r\nMoreover, I'm only interested in matching against hswish that follows qconv only (so hswish in dense -> hswish for example, shouldn't match). So I cannot simply decouple qconv and hswish patterns. To match against qconv + hswish, I need a total of 4 boolean flags,  `with_pad`, `with_bias`, `with_relu`, `with_requantize`, and generate 2^4 patterns, to cover all possibilities. \r\n\r\nIdeally, I would just have a one big \"qconv + hswish\" pattern with 4 optional \"holes\" in it, that can match against all 2^4 possible structures. I don't think the alt pattern can do this, as it requires writing both lhs and rhs patterns explicitly.

It lets you construct a series of optional patterns with relatively clean syntax. Note, it lets you constuct a tree of optional calls, but it still imposes the order you construct them in. Let me know if you think that will work.\r\n\r\nThanks for the quick action! The API looks good to me.

It would be possible to make a new class, say AnnotationPatternRewriter some some such, that inherits from PatternRewriter. It would keep a map of everything it's annotated, the memoized version of what it was rewritten to, and the default memoization behavior would return memoized ops if they haven't been annotated, or compiler_end(memoized) if they have been annotated. It requires a few lines of C++ and a new interface, but I think that would do what you're looking for. \r\n\r\nI think it should probably be a second PR, though.
