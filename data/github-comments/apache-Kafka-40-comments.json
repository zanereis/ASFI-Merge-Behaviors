I plan to pick up on this with near total focus in the next few days. My apologies for the delay.

Because topic creation is fire and forget in the current implimentation. It's not \"transactional\" in anyway. Meaning if I block for 5 minutes and the topic is still not completely created it may get created later, unless I have some sort of undo logic. I am thinking just blocking and leaving the existing behavior as is may be a good middle ground.
