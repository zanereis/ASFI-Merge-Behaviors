last commit (auth de/serialization) by running a simple job (80 million records, GCS to S3 and back) on the DataflowRunner with 10 workers and the following values for the awsCredentialsProvider flag:\r\n\r\n- `'{\"@type\":\"AWSStaticCredentialsProvider\",\"awsAccessKeyId\":\"redacted\",\"awsSecretKey\":\"redacted\"}'`\r\n  - Success\r\n\r\n- `'{\"@type\":\"ThisIsGarbage\",\"awsAccessKeyId\":\"redacted\",\"awsSecretKey\":\"redacted\"}'`\r\n  - Failure: java.io.IOException: AWS credential provider type 'ThisIsGarbage' is not supported\r\n\r\nI believe most implementations of AWSCredentialsProvider are supported, but not all. There are a bunch of providers that are singletons, so they were easy to add. Unit tests confirm they should work, but I don't have a way to test them. The more complex providers are certainly within reach for someone that needs them (and can test them).\r\n\r\nThe default provider is DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain, which should work for a lot of development environments using DirectRunner.\r\n\r\nI did not perform bigger tests with this auth commit because they are expensive to run and because they wouldn't prove anything about auth working or not.\r\n\r\nThanks to @lukecwik for an extra hand in getting through the credentials serialization.\r\n\r\nThere have been a handful of requests for various features to be included in this PR. The PR has taken months already; can we get this initial implementation submitted with the current feature set? That will unlock anyone else from submitting their own, smaller PRs to improve the S3 filesystem. For example, I have a Redshift CL that I would really like to share.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/360866981/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/360881146","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/4110#issuecomment-360881146","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4110","id":360881146,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MDg4MTE0Ng==","user":{"login":"akedin","id":33067037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDY3MDM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33067037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin","html_url":"https://github.com/akedin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-26T19:28:18Z","updated_at":"2018-01-26T19:28:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closing

can confirm that using the original JdbcIO.write() method on the DataflowRunner does group the writes into batches.

I also compared the performance of the original JdbcIO.write() method with the JdbcIO.writeIterable() method on Cloud Spanner using the DataflowRunner. I could not measure any significant difference. This means that, at least as far as I'm concerned, the functionality for writeIterable() is no longer needed.\r\nI still updated the PR based on the review and my own test results.
