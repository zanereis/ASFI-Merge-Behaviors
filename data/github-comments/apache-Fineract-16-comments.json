\r\n\r\nNo, I'm actively against that, because I fear that could create a lot more confusion than answer anyone's question... that repo de facto is \"dead\", given that it hasn't been updated in 4 years, and IMHO we shouldn't refer to it anymore from Fineract's README (other than perhaps from a \"Historical\" section for archaeologists, if anyone would like to add something like that).\r\n\r\nI do understand the (old) issue about Pentaho-based reports having been \"lost\" in the move to Apache. That is a problem I suspect someone will want to address somehow, someday (with a separate additional service, perhaps?), but this PR is not the place for that? \r\n\r\nAnyway, strictly speaking, https://github.com/openMF/mifosx is course not the \"pentaho reports related module\", but a (now very old) predecessor version of the same code that is in this repo.

You can now achieve the same with server.forward-headers-strategy=native. Because each server has a specific behavior, we now offer an alternative which relies on Spring’s ForwardedHeaderFilter: server.forward-headers-strategy=framework. Developers should use the option that fits best their use case.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that for us to use a Spring Framework Filter is better than to rely on Tomcat's for this, because this means it will work the same if we ever switched e.g. from Tomcat to Jetty, or if someone were to be crazy enough to deploy the Fineract WAR in something like WAS or WLS... :smiling_imp: Also, `frameworks` actually does work and solves the problem... :smile: see details in FINERACT-914.\r\n\r\n> Is the server.forward-headers-strategy=framework going to affect good old fashion tomcat deployments?\r\n\r\nNo, it should not. This thing basically just checks for certain HTTP Headers related to SSL proxies and relevant for \"serious\" deployments, such as https://www.fineract.dev. In our \"traditional\" deployment environments, such as Tomcat running locally, or inside a Docker Container for Docker Compose, those HTTP Headers will not be present, and this PR should be a NOOP for those.\r\n\r\nThanks for the questions and doing a real review!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/623202643/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/623371051","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/817#issuecomment-623371051","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/817","id":623371051,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyMzM3MTA1MQ==","user":{"login":"maektwain","id":8274610,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNzQ2MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8274610?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maektwain","html_url":"https://github.com/maektwain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maektwain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maektwain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maektwain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maektwain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maektwain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maektwain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maektwain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maektwain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maektwain/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-04T09:57:56Z","updated_at":"2020-05-04T09:57:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"aha ! moving to functional style, strongly advise that we move other test cases also to await ability \r\nthough did you check this out [Await](https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/wiki/Usage)  \r\n\r\nsome question what about thread configuration ?\r\n\r\nThough I would like to see this happening, \r\n\r\n```java \r\nawait().atMost(5, SECONDS).until(scheduler());\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat I see from your example is that we can do this \r\n\r\n```java \r\n@Test(timeout = 2000)\r\n    public void awaitOperationSupportsSpecifyingZeroAsPollInterval() {\r\n        new Asynch(fakeRepository).perform();\r\n        with().pollDelay(TWO_HUNDRED_MILLISECONDS).pollInterval(Duration.ZERO).then().await().until(fakeRepositoryValueEqualsOne());\r\n        assertEquals(1, fakeRepository.getValue());\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSources are awaitility package\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/623371051/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/623419612","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/807#issuecomment-623419612","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/807","id":623419612,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyMzQxOTYxMg==","user":{"login":"ptuomola","id":2398858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzOTg4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2398858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola","html_url":"https://github.com/ptuomola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-04T11:55:10Z","updated_at":"2020-05-04T11:55:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> @ptuomola this now fails in the (brand new...) `ClasspathHellDuplicatesCheckRuleTest` introduced in https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/803/files, see [FINERACT-919](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FINERACT-919) for background.

So that should all be OK now.\r\n\r\nMy only concern about this pull request is: after this, Fineract will need Tomcat 9 or above to run. The WAR does not work on Tomcat 7/8 anymore as it has been compiled against Tomcat 9 JARs, and there are some classes that are not present in 7/8. Is that going to be a problem? I.e. are there people who are using Tomcat 7 and expecting Fineract to work? Do we need to communicate this to everyone somehow so that they are aware?\r\n\r\nIf this is an issue, it might be possibility to build two versions of the WAR - one for Tomcat (including 7/8) and another one for Spring Boot. But if no one is using Tomcat 7/8 (or if we can expect people to upgrade to 9), then of course it would be good to keep things simple...\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/623419612/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/623479143","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/738#issuecomment-623479143","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/738","id":623479143,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyMzQ3OTE0Mw==","user":{"login":"rrpawar96","id":20750973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzUwOTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20750973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrpawar96","html_url":"https://github.com/rrpawar96","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrpawar96/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrpawar96/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrpawar96/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrpawar96/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrpawar96/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrpawar96/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrpawar96/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrpawar96/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrpawar96/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-04T13:55:51Z","updated_at":"2020-05-04T13:55:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"All
