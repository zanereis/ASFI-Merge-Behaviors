@Fokko , my understanding on this part is similar to https://packaging.python.org/discussions/install-requires-vs-requirements/ which we specify library version with lower /upper bound without pinning the version. Hence if some of the libraries somehow have breaking change, our install will fail while having a pin version of requirements provides consistent dependency for development based on the recommendation. We only upgrade the dependency in requirement if we need to(e.g security violation, out of date etc).\r\n\r\nI look at https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset which have both requirement.txt and setup.py.

on deleting under-utilized features :P \r\n\r\nI see that CI/CD is still failing on ```sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: (_mysql_exceptions.OperationalError) (3730, \"Cannot drop table 'users' referenced by a foreign key constraint 'known_event_ibfk_2' on table 'known_event'.\") [SQL: '\\nDROP TABLE users']```\r\n\r\nI think this is happening when attempting `airflow reset` in the ci/cd scripts, which in turn looks for all the tables that the sqlalchemy engine can find, and then delete them. But since the code for KnownEvent/KnownEventType models is removed, those tables didn't get detected/deleted, so now the `user` table can't get deleted because `known_event` has a reference to it. I think we will need to modify the ci/cd script and explicitly add a `drop table known_event; drop table known_event_type;` now... maybe there's a better way to do that. \r\n\r\nIn addition, @Fokko if you do a grep on `known_events` instead of `knownevent`, there are quite a few changes in the alembic scripts, but I don't see any problems with it since they are just creating/upgrading tables. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/453435480/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/453438370","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4298#issuecomment-453438370","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4298","id":453438370,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MzQzODM3MA==","user":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-11T08:59:25Z","updated_at":"2019-01-11T08:59:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"My pleasure @kaxil ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/453438370/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/453438916","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4421#issuecomment-453438916","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4421","id":453438916,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MzQzODkxNg==","user":{"login":"jgao54","id":17896160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODk2MTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17896160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54","html_url":"https://github.com/jgao54","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-11T09:00:56Z","updated_at":"2019-01-11T09:00:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@feng-tao \r\nmy 2c on alembic scripts example you provided.

The way it is implemented now is quite bad for users who want to pull the image and then keep updated with future changes. Every time you push a new commit, pretty much the whole image will be created from scratch. This is quite bad for someone who would like to pull the image regularly - because every time they pull it they will effectively pull the whole image as it will be pretty much single layer image. Plus you do not tap into benefit of docker downloading and decompressing the layers in parallel if you have mutli-layered image.\r\n\r\nLayering the image with separately installing apt-get dependencies and then installing airflow via pip on top of it and then possibly updating dependencies / airflow (with possibility to rebuild starting from any layer if needed) could provide a much better experience with users only pulling incremental layers for future updates.
