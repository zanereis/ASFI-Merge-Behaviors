I think some public members of AccumuloInputSplit were not intened to be in public API, but end up there because RangeInputSplit extends AccumuloInputSplit.  I think public API types extending impl types is nothing but trouble.   \n\nI think another issue needs to be opened.  I think the map reduce public API is a mess.  Too much of the implementation is in the API, makes it very hard to add features.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/94964526/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/95645127","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/31#issuecomment-95645127","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/31","id":95645127,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk1NjQ1MTI3","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-23T16:31:00Z","updated_at":"2015-04-23T16:31:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[Accumulo-Pull-Requests #63](https://builds.apache.org/job/Accumulo-Pull-Requests/63/) SUCCESS\nThis pull request looks good\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/95645127/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/95655661","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/32#issuecomment-95655661","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/32","id":95655661,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk1NjU1NjYx","user":{"login":"joshelser","id":67863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3ODYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser","html_url":"https://github.com/joshelser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-23T17:06:23Z","updated_at":"2015-04-23T17:06:23Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for continuing to work on this, @thormanrd.

It doesn't strictly adhere to the line length restrictions.\n2. It adds a trailing space to indent empty javadoc lines.\n\nWe've already accounted for the line length in the checkstyle rules by making it much larger than the Eclipse formatter. With this patch, I think we could probably just ignore trailing whitespace (and drop the corresponding checkstyle enforcement), since the formatter will remove the ones we mainly care about anyway (the javadoc ones are annoying, but there's not a lot of good options so long as Eclipse fails to fix that issue). We could just strip whitespace with `sed` after the formatter executes.\n\nOne thing I'd like to see, though (for the purposes of a review) is just the pom changes, separate from any resulting formatting changes (I'm sure I can do this with some command-line Git Fu, though, so it's no big deal).\n\nI did see that the formatting significantly changed some lines that looked deliberately formatted to make it more readable. For those lines, we may wish to add the `@formatter:off` / `@formatter:on` tags to retain existing formatting.\n\nI'm also curious what happens with the `-Pthrift` profile activated. Will this plugin reformat the generated thrift code? Maybe that's okay, but it might be annoying. If the generated thrift code were in a separate package, it could be avoided more easily, though.\n\nI'm overall +1 to the idea, but it might need some tweaking.\n\nI especially like the idea that we could focus our style choices on readability, because writing to conform to a particular style doesn't matter any more (write in whatever style you like and the build will fix it).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/99120050/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/99123399","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/35#issuecomment-99123399","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/35","id":99123399,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk5MTIzMzk5","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-05T15:55:53Z","updated_at":"2015-05-05T15:55:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> One thing I'd like to see, though (for the purposes of a review) is just the pom change\n\nThe PR has two commits.

just pushed an updated PR with following changes:\n- Modified the configuration of the maven-java-formatter-plugin in `pom.xml` to use a newer version (3.10) of the eclipse.jdt.core.  This reduced but did not eliminate the number of trailing whitespace changes.   The number of files changed by the formatter was reduced from the 550 to 170.\n- I agree with Christoper about the formatter.  It mostly removes whitespace.  The only place where it adds whitespace is in block comments.  To get checkstyle work, I modified the \"Trailing whitespace\" checkstyle rule ignore whitespace after an asterisk `*`.\n- Excluded thrift and proto buffer files in the formatter plugin configuration\n\nI reviewed all of the files that were changed after running the formatter.  While they look good to me, feel free to comment on any formatting that should remain and I can add `// @formatter:off` comments to those sections of the code.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/99519198/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/99521744","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/35#issuecomment-99521744","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/35","id":99521744,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk5NTIxNzQ0","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-06T15:56:06Z","updated_at":"2015-05-06T15:56:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":">
