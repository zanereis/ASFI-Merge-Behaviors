So DoFn is still preferable.\r\n\r\nRe embedded Hive config: seems like these hive-site.xml and hive-log4j2.properties are exact copies of those in https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/master/data/conf/hive-site.xml ? I guess in that case it's ok to have the large configs, but it'd be good to add a comment in those files explaining where they come from.\r\n\r\nAlso: how long does the unit test take to run? I'm wondering, if it requires this much set up, it might be too heavyweight to be a unit test and perhaps should be changed into unit tests with mocks + integration tests with real Hive.
