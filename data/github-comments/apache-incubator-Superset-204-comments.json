But in cases where I have built a dashboard and saved it. After coming back again in different tab/window, it again refreshes the whole dashboard which takes time. Can't we keep the saved dashboard as static unless a user wants to refresh it? This makes it less productive as u can't share the dashboard with anyone as they would have to wait for it to refresh the whole dashboard again.

For example I would like to better understand what it means to save over an existing chart. What are the implications?\r\n- We should center the warning on the screen so we're not covering up what is being referenced (in this case the chart title).\r\n- I agree with Max that having to close out a warning message every time I change the title of a chart isn't an ideal experience. I would expect that I could change that name without issue.\r\n\r\nPersonally I think there's a lot of value in pushing for a more dashboard like editing experience. We should explore it, communicate it out and see if there is push back.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/476866779/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/476877343","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/4725#issuecomment-476877343","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/4725","id":476877343,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3Njg3NzM0Mw==","user":{"login":"Tresdon","id":9629830,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2Mjk4MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9629830?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tresdon","html_url":"https://github.com/Tresdon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tresdon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tresdon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tresdon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tresdon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tresdon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tresdon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tresdon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tresdon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tresdon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-26T22:27:27Z","updated_at":"2019-03-26T22:27:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mistercrunch anything else you would like to see done with this?

understood from this issue discussion is to resolve this, I have to replace the following line in models.py**\r\n```532         return Markup('<a

what you are suggesting to do?\r\nIf that is the case, after I change like that and restarted it, my previous charts which I had made will be available or not?\r\nIf that is not the case, kindly let me know the procedure steps\r\nBTW,I'm a beginner in python and venvs\r\nFYI,I have placed an error stacktrace\r\n```\r\n**Sorry, something went wrong\r\n500 - Internal Server Error**\r\nTraceback
