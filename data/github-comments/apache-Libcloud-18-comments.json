I used `kwargs` because it's the way some \"_unusual_\" parameters (like `domainid` and `projectid`) are passed with this driver.

It seems that by adding that parameter into the base connection class, has highlighted that a number of the vendor specific drivers also didn't pass down the proxy_url parameter.
