In our case, we have a web server layer on top of many layers of backends which communicate in thrift, e,g. \r\n\r\n> web server -> backend A -> backend B -> backend C.\r\n\r\nIt will be very difficult for trouble shooting on the web server or backend A. Since we will never ever show exception message from the web server to the browser or client app, so there is no way to trigger an exception and see the details of the backend servers. I believe the developers of the web servers or API gateways have the responsibility to keep the details no leaking to the outside of the world.

I am going to need some time to review it further.  The server layer should know nothing about the transport which it looks like you addressed, but similarly the transport layer should know nothing about the server.  There's a new TNonblockingSSLServerSocket class here - this seems to be combining the responsibility of the transport with that of knowing the server type is.\r\n\r\nHere are a couple things to consider from a quick review:\r\n\r\n1.  I wonder if you need the Nonblocking socket classes; instead if you have TNonblockingServer call TSSLSocket::setLibeventSafe(false) after asking for the socket from the factory - you might not need a Nonblocking factory at all (a nonblocking socket factory combines server and transport concerns).\r\n\r\n2. Is there any reason isLibeventSafe() branches only apply to TSSLSocket?  If the same reasoning applies to TSocket as well, then perhaps that logic moves into TSocket so TNonblockingServer uses TSocket the same way as TSSLSocket?\r\n\r\nI'm curious what the specific \"not libevent safe\" mechanisms are.

And additional api's are added for Nonblockingtransport which are not required in blockingtransport.\r\n\r\nAnd currently TSSLSocket underlying implementation is Nonblocking by default and uses select api.\r\nTNonblockingServer implementation uses libevent which inturn calls select api's. We cannot use libevent with select as  there will be a race condition between select and libevent as both poll for events on registered sockets. Ideally there should be another class called TNonblockingSSLSocket which can be used with NonblockingServers. TSocket underlying implentation does not use select, so there is no need to have any libeventsafe methods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/295982518/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/296064707","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/1251#issuecomment-296064707","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/1251","id":296064707,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NjA2NDcwNw==","user":{"login":"jeking3","id":11771245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzcxMjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11771245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3","html_url":"https://github.com/jeking3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-21T04:56:31Z","updated_at":"2017-04-21T04:56:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Interruptable sockets can be controlled by the server during creation, I believe - one should not need another class to use TSocket in a non-interruptable fashion.

Most languages don't need it for proper operation, as I suggested with C++ which processes one request per connection at a time.  In some work I did for Dell EqualLogic a number of years ago, I leveraged a sequence number to rewrite the C# thrift engine so it could support multiple outstanding requests, and effectively would allow multiple threads to share the same connection and submit multiple concurrent requests.  So I do like to see proper sequence IDs in the request/response for each language.  It would be nice to have better tests proving these work in two ways - one is to make sure that a seqId a client passes in for each server language and protocol returns the seqId in the response.  The other would be to make sure every client actually sends a unique seqId.  Both are possible through crosstest with some work.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime though, having proper support for sequence IDs probably starts in the protocol implementation.  The protocol carries the sequence.  Generating a sequence ID in the compiler, or adding code that does seems incorrect to me.  It should be up to the constructor for a new binary protocol header to generate a new sequence ID, and the server implementation should honor it by carrying it through the response.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/299211882/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/299463987","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/1260#issuecomment-299463987","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/1260","id":299463987,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5OTQ2Mzk4Nw==","user":{"login":"allengeorge","id":69364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/allengeorge","html_url":"https://github.com/allengeorge","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allengeorge/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allengeorge/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allengeorge/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allengeorge/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allengeorge/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allengeorge/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allengeorge/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allengeorge/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allengeorge/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-05T13:26:19Z","updated_at":"2017-05-05T13:26:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jeking3 One hopes that...congratulations are in order? :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/299463987/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/299487997","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/1260#issuecomment-299487997","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/1260","id":299487997,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5OTQ4Nzk5Nw==","user":{"login":"jeking3","id":11771245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzcxMjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11771245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3","html_url":"https://github.com/jeking3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-05T14:58:33Z","updated_at":"2017-05-05T14:58:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Essentially same job as before, we were acquired and cut over on May 1.
