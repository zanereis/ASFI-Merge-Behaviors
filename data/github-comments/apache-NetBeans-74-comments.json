Thanks for sharing the link. After skimming through the docs three questions puzzle in my mind:\r\n\r\n1. While promised in the teaser pages, there is no specification for **debugging** - that's tough one to abstract\r\n2. I was hoping to have the *mx projects* support in 12.3 - yet the BSP looks very **experimental** (like the missing debugging support)\r\n3. Should NetBeans acts as a **server or client**? The NetBeans infrastructure is actually ideal for abstracting over various build systems and responding to the BSP queries!\r\n\r\nIdeally we get this PR in, someone sits and implements BSP server based on NetBeans project infrastructure and then we'll have BSP for `mx`!
