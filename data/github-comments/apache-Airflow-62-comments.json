Commit message is updated according to the rules.\n\n@criccomini I am sorry for taking so long to respond. You have a good point, sometimes response status can be useful. The assumption of the current implementation is to keep it simple. Storing response text can go a long way and cover many use cases. Users have the ultimate knowledge of the response they expect. It can be parsed as JSON, XML or HTML later on.\n\nJust like `BashOperator` stores the output of the command only, so does the current implementation of `HttpOperator`. Users can extend `HttpOperator` to xcom push more attributes of the response specific for their use case, just like they can extend `BashOperator` to push exit code of the shell command.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/241749874/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/241816913","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1675#issuecomment-241816913","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1675","id":241816913,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MTgxNjkxMw==","user":{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-23T17:51:27Z","updated_at":"2016-08-23T17:51:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@yiqingj good catch this! @jlowin just tried in a notebook, no python doesnt complain (2.7).
