Currently we don't support explicitly setting partitions for `RealtimeSegmentAssignment`, so we should fix that instead of introducing this new strategy\r\n> \r\n> I feel this is not exactly the same as `numInstancesPerPartition=1`, instead `numInstancesPerPartition` shall be the same as the number of replicas. In fact, the strategy is somewhat deterministic as the added stragy name suggests. And the main purpose is to make the assignment declarative and reduce the operational cost, e.g. we dont need to update `numInstancesPerPartition` when we increase `numPartitions` to scale out the table etc\r\n\r\nThis new strategy is trying to put all segments from the same segment partition to the same server, which is exactly the same as what `numInstancesPerPartition = 1` is doing (and it is also deterministic).\r\nIn order to achieve this, you should use the partition based replica-group assignment, and always put `numInstancesPerPartition = 1`. You may increase `numPartitions` if needed (should be very rare because it should be the same as table partitions, and changing it requires re-partitioning all the segments). Noted that `numPartitions` can be larger than the total instances within a replica-group. E.g. with 9 servers, you can have 3 replica-groups (3 servers per replica), then 18 partitions, and each server will host 6 partitions. You may scale it up to 18 servers, and run a rebalance without changing `numInstancesPerPartition` or `numPartitions`. After rebalancing, each server will host 3 partitions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1215987719/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1215992249","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/9188#issuecomment-1215992249","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/9188","id":1215992249,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5IepG5","user":{"login":"huaheh","id":5535641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MzU2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5535641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaheh","html_url":"https://github.com/huaheh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaheh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaheh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaheh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaheh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaheh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaheh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaheh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaheh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaheh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-15T23:49:08Z","updated_at":"2022-08-15T23:49:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks, the \"null ignoring\" behavior is very useful and currently satisfies our needs.

That means that given two images, they will probably use the same base and therefore the space/download time would be paid only once\r\n> * 617MBs of apt-update and apt-install, which is not reusable at all. We can improve this by creating a specific base image and reusing it.\r\n> * 716MBs of apache-pinot, which are copied in a single layer. Of which:\r\n>   \r\n>   * 100MBs are examples, which are very static (they almost never change)\r\n>   * 454MBs are plugins, which are mostly shaded dependencies. They are highly optimizable with docker layers, but we cannot use that because they are shaded\r\n>   * 150MBs are pinot itself and their dependencies. I guess most of it would be the dependencies, which again could be layered, but they are shaded.\r\n> \r\n> This means that each time we change a single character and create a new docker image, we are storing and downloading in our pods (617 + 716)MBs of data. I think that almost 1GB of that data is static information we could just reuse if correctly using docker layers.\r\n> \r\n> What @xiangfu0 suggested about having different images with more or less plugins or that are able to download plugins at start time can be a solution, but I think it would have the side effect of making quite more difficult to understand to customers. If instead of doing that we just correctly use the layers, the first time a user downloads an image will need to download 1.3GBs of data, but if then he/she downloads a second version, it is very probable that most of the layers would be the same, so he/she would only need to download around 150MBs of data. It also applies to our own pods, which would only need to download these 150MBs instead of 1.3GBs on most upgrades.\r\n\r\nThis is interesting, I feel just make a `pinot-base` image can actually help reduce docker pull size a lot!\r\n\r\nAlso for the base image, do you see when this image should be updated?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1216387290/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1216872885","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/9221#issuecomment-1216872885","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/9221","id":1216872885,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5IiAG1","user":{"login":"siddharthteotia","id":2150694,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTA2OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2150694?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia","html_url":"https://github.com/siddharthteotia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-16T16:29:48Z","updated_at":"2022-08-16T16:29:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I don't think this should be done automatically as it risks breaking changes.\r\n\r\ncc @walterddr ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1216872885/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1216872930","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/9221#issuecomment-1216872930","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/9221","id":1216872930,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5IiAHi","user":{"login":"dependabot[bot]","id":49699333,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDk2OTkzMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/29110?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/dependabot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-16T16:29:50Z","updated_at":"2022-08-16T16:29:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"OK, I won't notify you again about this release, but will get in touch when a new version is available.

If the user-specified headers are non-primitives, then it will add to the cost. But in my current implementation, I haven't even added support for a header value decoder. It assumes that header key is a string and the value is a primitive. this is a good question.

@navina, thank you for looking!\n\nI agree that this would likely be better as a table level check and maybe even happen continuously through the lifecycle of the server so the broker is aware what servers are fresh enough to server data (I think Kafka does something similar with its brokers).\n\nThat said, I think Pinot currently lacks some of the protection needed to do something like that. I know at the scale of our events, even 1 table catching up utilizes a large amount of CPU for example. And while tables can have their consumption rate limited, it's up to the user to make sure that's tuned correctly rather than being able to rely on Pinot to ensure there's always enough CPU to serve queries quickly.\n\nThis was also much easier to implement as a starting point. Kudos to whoever wrote the Offset based startup checker because I was able to follow that pattern to easily do this as well. I realize the description also lacked some motivation. But we've seen cases where the Offset based checker take 10-15 minutes to catchup to that offset at server start, the server starts serving queries, but then we are 10-15 minutes behind still and the server is slow to serve queries until it actually finishes catching up.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1220771563/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1220908246","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/9249#issuecomment-1220908246","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/9249","id":1220908246,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5IxZTW","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-19T17:15:52Z","updated_at":"2022-08-19T17:15:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/9249?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) Report\n> Merging [#9249](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/9249?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (c3d7a22) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/commit/6c5d85ef7eeffcd4cddd639865b81764fb04dbf1?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (6c5d85e) will **decrease** coverage by `2.81%`.\n> The diff coverage is `53.33%`.\n\n> :exclamation: Current head c3d7a22 differs from pull request most recent head e6eaa85.

I didn't know Kafka does something like this. I know that it tries to load the active partitions. However, a while back , it was made asynchronous. Perhaps I need to go back and see the latest code. \r\n \r\n> That said, I think Pinot currently lacks some of the protection needed to do something like that. I know at the scale of our events, even 1 table catching up utilizes a large amount of CPU for example. And while tables can have their consumption rate limited, it's up to the user to make sure that's tuned correctly rather than being able to rely on Pinot to ensure there's always enough CPU to serve queries quickly.\r\n\r\nThanks for explaining. I see where you are coming from. Basically, the user ends up tuning per-table level rate limit according to steady state and not peak / catchup traffic. I see the imbalance that can happen during startup on a cluster with multiple tables. \r\n \r\n> But we've seen cases where the Offset based checker take 10-15 minutes to catchup to that offset at server start, the server starts serving queries, but then we are 10-15 minutes behind still and the server is slow to serve queries until it actually finishes catching up.\r\n\r\nI see. My concern was around this checker not allowing the server to start during the startup timeout. I have noticed cases where sometimes a segment doesn't load and the status checker just hangs while the consumer is going full throttle to catchup. Eventually, the server times-out and reboots. That's why I felt it is better to de-couple the start-up validation from server health. \r\n\r\nWe can tackle this in a separate PR. But thanks for the context!

That's because the StreamPartitionMsgOffset interface only tells us if we're caught up or we're behind, but it it doesn't tell us by how many events we are behind. That was the reason we couldn't define a threshold for catchup when offset based status checker was added.\r\n> \r\n> Anyways, the current PR has duplicate code between OffsetBasedStatusChecker and FreshnessBasedStatusChecker. I think by making a small change to the OffsetBasedStatusChecker, we can achieve the goal of this PR. We can pass in a config for freshness threshold to OffsetBasedStatusChecker and where we get the stream latest offset at startup, if the config is provided, we can get stream latest offset at the current moment and check the freshness then.\r\n\r\nGood point.

Are we using all of them?\r\n\r\nAt a high level, I am planning to:\r\n\r\n1. Pass a limit down to [processBrokerRequest](https://github.com/tanmesh/pinot/blob/fc696ceb4b9386f3023ed9911c88022e6e2fa152/pinot-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/broker/requesthandler/BaseBrokerRequestHandler.java#L571) method after extracting it from the compiled pinot query. Note: limit would only be passed for early terminate cases (ie, select and select distinct without ORDER BY)\r\n2. Return early from [offline server request](https://github.com/tanmesh/pinot/blob/fc696ceb4b9386f3023ed9911c88022e6e2fa152/pinot-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/broker/requesthandler/GrpcBrokerRequestHandler.java#L96)  after limit no of responses are received from offline servers or go to [real time servers](https://github.com/tanmesh/pinot/blob/fc696ceb4b9386f3023ed9911c88022e6e2fa152/pinot-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/broker/requesthandler/GrpcBrokerRequestHandler.java#L101) to gather limit responses\r\n3. No changes needed in [reduceOnStreamResponse](https://github.com/tanmesh/pinot/blob/fc696ceb4b9386f3023ed9911c88022e6e2fa152/pinot-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/broker/requesthandler/GrpcBrokerRequestHandler.java#L104) as it would only have limit no of responses.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know how the implementation proposal sounds and if I am missing something.
