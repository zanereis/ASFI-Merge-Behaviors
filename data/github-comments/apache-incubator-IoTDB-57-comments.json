So count references maybe not needed, we just add it when initialize, and remove it when delete timeseries.\r\n\r\nI don't think this way would work. As the strings from `CacheStringPool` are passed to different instances, you must know all of the references of a key are released then the `CacheStringPool` could remove the key. Otherwise, you would hold different instances for same string which will lose the meaning of `CacheStringPool`. \r\n\r\nAnd for the class, it designs to provide ability like string intern, but has implementation defects. You can't restrict it only used to hold device or measurement path unless you name it something like `DevicePathPool` or `MeasurementPathPool` instead of `CacheStringPool`.\r\n\r\nThe two ways I can figure out are either use `WeakHashMap<String, WeakRefernce<String>>` instead of `ConcurrentHashMap` or  `String.intern()`. I prefer the later one in the
