And it already supports hive, mysql, CK, PG, sqlserver, etc. How can I continue to communicate with you","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/894090183/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/894095886","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/5083#issuecomment-894095886","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/5083","id":894095886,"node_id":"IC_kwDOClTkms41StIO","user":{"login":"zhuangchong","id":37063904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MDYzOTA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37063904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangchong","html_url":"https://github.com/zhuangchong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangchong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangchong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangchong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangchong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangchong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangchong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangchong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangchong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangchong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-06T08:26:52Z","updated_at":"2021-08-06T08:26:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Narcasserun \r\n\r\nYou can open a new issue to express your ideas, design plan.\r\nFinally associated with this issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/894095886/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/894101713","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/5083#issuecomment-894101713","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/5083","id":894101713,"node_id":"IC_kwDOClTkms41SujR","user":{"login":"Narcasserun","id":39329477,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MzI5NDc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39329477?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Narcasserun","html_url":"https://github.com/Narcasserun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Narcasserun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Narcasserun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Narcasserun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Narcasserun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Narcasserun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Narcasserun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Narcasserun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Narcasserun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Narcasserun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-06T08:36:59Z","updated_at":"2021-08-06T08:36:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> @Narcasserun\r\n> \r\n> You can open a new issue to express your ideas, design plan.\r\n> Finally associated with this issue.\r\n\r\n#5954 This issue includes the idea of data source creation and metadata.

1.

If you are not supplementing data, you can try $[yyyyMMdd-1]\r\n\r\nThanks for your reply, I found the configuration instructions now after your help. \r\nThe configuration instructions said: The day before the scheduled time of the daily scheduling instance, the format is yyyyMMdd, when the data is supplemented, the date is +1.\r\n\r\nI have a specific problem, I have two workflows ODS_01 and DWD_01,Dwd_01 depends on ODS_01. Today, ODS_01 was executed through the daily scheduling instance(scheduleTime is 2021-08-12 03:00:00), but DWD_01 was not executed. I started DWD_01 through the data complement task(scheduleTime is 2021-08-11 03:00:00), but because their dates were inconsistent, DWD_01 could not find the successful ODS_01 instance when checking whether the pre-dependent was completed.So it's been impossible to execute. \r\nAny reply would be
