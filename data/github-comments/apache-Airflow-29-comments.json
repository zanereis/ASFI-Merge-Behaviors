Basically, any DAG that doesn't use incremental date-based partitioning would benefit from this.\n\nA trivial example is a DAG that simply snapshots a full DB and loads it into a BLOB store.

DBs like mysql, postgresql do not impose limits in the IN-clause, though I am not sure about limits on host parameters.

Could it be because retries are set to 0? If so the behavior is still surprising since we force the retry?`\n\nSo, if you are running the release version, there was a known bug in which we had infinite retries, though that only happened if the retries was set to a number above 0. If retries was set to 0, then no retries would happen -- that is by design since you are asking for 0 retries. At this point, I need a pretty clear definition of the issue. If you want a finite number of retries, set the count above 0 and run the latest code. If you are okay with running infinite retries until success, then set the value above 0 and run the release version (1.6.2). If you don't want retries, set it to 0 on any version. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/190411447/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/190415565","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/1077#issuecomment-190415565","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1077","id":190415565,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MDQxNTU2NQ==","user":{"login":"krisskross","id":414023,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNDAyMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/414023?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/krisskross","html_url":"https://github.com/krisskross","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krisskross/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krisskross/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krisskross/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krisskross/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krisskross/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krisskross/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krisskross/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krisskross/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krisskross/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-29T21:56:46Z","updated_at":"2016-02-29T21:56:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Yes, i'm toying around with airflow 1.6.2 at the moment to see if it fits our needs.

I added try statements inside the timeout context manager so that it goes disabled when using LocalExecutor or other subprocesses. \n\nThis timeout is important as it makes sure that if a pipeline takes a long time to parse (say someone would run a Hive job in the python code of the pipeline instead of using an operator), the script times out after 30 seconds and all the other pipelines can move on. Without the timeout, a bad actor could hold up the scheduler for long periods.\n\nWe may want to take a different, more generic approach to timeouts eventually, but I the current approach should be good.

But this maybe a problem if you run some tasks over cli because that will be another executor \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/191450866/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/191454976","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/1081#issuecomment-191454976","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1081","id":191454976,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MTQ1NDk3Ng==","user":{"login":"neovintage","id":2482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neovintage","html_url":"https://github.com/neovintage","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neovintage/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neovintage/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neovintage/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neovintage/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neovintage/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neovintage/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neovintage/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neovintage/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neovintage/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-02T22:07:55Z","updated_at":"2016-03-02T22:07:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@laura-moore I don't have a strong preference on the solutions you've presented.
