Intermediate snapshots are removed on commit, so I would imagine the only case where the metadata could refer to snapshots that were never current is if the commit were rejected. In that case, the snapshots wouldn't be reachable from the current commit. What am I missing?\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```sql\r\n-- S1\r\nCREATE TABLE test.ns.tbl USING iceberg AS\r\nSELECT * FROM VALUES (1, \"Alice\"), (2, \"Bob\") AS (id, fname);\r\n\r\n-- S2\r\nCREATE OR REPLACE TABLE test.ns.tbl USING iceberg AS\r\nSELECT * FROM VALUES (1, 5, \"alice\"), (2, 3, \"bob\") AS (id, name_len, name) ;\r\n\r\n-- S3\r\nINSERT INTO test.ns.tbl VALUES (3, 5, \"carol\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe table `test.ns.tbl` has 3 valid states. So we should be able to read each one individually. `Table.history()`, after all 3 statements have executed, only returns entries for `S2` and `S3`; while `Table.snapshots()` returns all 3.\r\n\r\nYou can rewind to `S1`, so it seems time-travel is using snapshots not the log. Trying to read the data will fail since it tries to cast the 2nd field to an integer, but it will succeed if you rewrite the snippet to use `(id, name, name_len)`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/701601287/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/701603547","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1490#issuecomment-701603547","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1490","id":701603547,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwMTYwMzU0Nw==","user":{"login":"massdosage","id":29457,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NDU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29457?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/massdosage","html_url":"https://github.com/massdosage","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massdosage/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massdosage/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massdosage/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massdosage/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massdosage/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massdosage/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massdosage/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massdosage/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massdosage/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-30T19:41:41Z","updated_at":"2020-09-30T19:41:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This is ready for another round of reviews.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/701603547/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/701603785","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1473#issuecomment-701603785","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1473","id":701603785,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwMTYwMzc4NQ==","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-30T19:42:07Z","updated_at":"2020-09-30T19:42:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"cc @holdenk ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/701603785/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/701627572","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1532#issuecomment-701627572","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1532","id":701627572,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwMTYyNzU3Mg==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-30T20:29:58Z","updated_at":"2020-09-30T20:29:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks good to me.

First, what is the use of restricting the scope of equality deletes? And second, why not use predicates for global deletes instead of equality files?\r\n\r\n> What doesn't make sense is recording the file name. . . . I actually can't think of any reason why we'd want to restrict it to a specific file.\r\n\r\nEquality deletes aren't restricted to a specific file. The position deletes remove a particular row in a data file, but equality deletes are like predicates applied to entire partitions.\r\n\r\nThere's good reason to be able to scope an equality delete to a partition. If we accumulated all of the equality deletes globally, then every data file could potentially have a huge number of deletes to apply. For example, consider a CDC stream that is being written to a table that changes rows through `UPSERT` operations by some row ID. If the table is also bucketed by that row ID, then we can easily reduce the number of deletes than need to be applied to the average data file by a couple orders of magnitude by restricting the scope of a delete to just one partition. This allows us to accumulate and efficiently handle more changes as deletes before it is necessary to compact.\r\n\r\nIn addition, because deletes are scoped by sequence number, we won't always be able to compact equality delete files together. If all of the deletes were at the table level, then there would necessarily be a lot more delete files to open per data file, even in a maintained table. That puts pressure on compacting deletes into data files, even if there are only a small number of deleted rows (could be one per file). Again, scoping by partition helps us avoid this causing problems.\r\n\r\n> Basic range filters would cover common use cases, such as \"delete all data older than X\".\r\n\r\nI think this suggestion was mainly motivated by the idea that all equality deletes could be globally scoped, but I think it's a good suggestion for global deletes. It would be really nice to be able to encode deletes like this for certain use cases. And global equality deletes are already a special case. Maybe we should make a way to encode expressions.\r\n\r\nMy main concerns with this are around overhead. If global deletes are equality deletes, then we can do some amount of work to determine which partitions match and re-encode the delete against those partitions. For example, in the `id = 5` case, even if the table is partitioned by time instead of id, I can go find the hours where the id was active based on lower/upper bounds in data files. That would work for lots of tables, where the record ids are correlated with time. But wouldn't be able to rewrite to more targeted deletes if any other expression were used.\r\n\r\nWe could store expressions instead of equality deletes everywhere to be able to do the rewrite, but that quickly turns into something horrible to apply at read time. A nice thing about equality deletes is that there is a small set of possible schemas (subsets of table columns) and delete files can be combined by unioning filter sets (or merging if rows are ordered).\r\n\r\nI think for now I'd opt not to add global delete filters, but if you think it is a good idea I'd be happy to discuss it more.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/701725686/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/701734612","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1535#issuecomment-701734612","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1535","id":701734612,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwMTczNDYxMg==","user":{"login":"rdsr","id":129474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTQ3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/129474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdsr","html_url":"https://github.com/rdsr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdsr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdsr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdsr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdsr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdsr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdsr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdsr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdsr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdsr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-01T01:30:15Z","updated_at":"2020-10-01T01:30:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LG!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/701734612/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/701735672","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1525#issuecomment-701735672","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1525","id":701735672,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwMTczNTY3Mg==","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-01T01:33:53Z","updated_at":"2020-10-01T01:33:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Let

The Inner error is\n\nCaused by: InvalidObjectException(message:db)\nat\norg.apache.hadoop.hive.metastore.api.ThriftHiveMetastore$create_table_with_environment_context_result$create_table_with_environment_context_resultStandardScheme.read(ThriftHiveMetastore.java:42216)\n\nWhich should be thrown when the thrift api makes a call and is unable to\nwork with the results. My guess would be that the hive client being\nincluded at runtime within Spark is not compatible with the metastore you\nare running. I know there are several incompatibilities between certain\nmetastore versions and certain versions of spark. I couldn't find any\ntickets for a 2.7x metastore in the Spark jira but I did see support for\n2.3, 2.4 and 3.0 and 3.1. So it may be related to that?

for elaborating. My thoughts...\r\n\r\n> For the write-audit-publish (WAP) pattern, there is an option to only stage a commit and not update the table's current-snapshot-id. In this case, the writer updates the table by creating a new snapshot. Then an auditor reads the snapshot and validates it (with row counts, for example), and if the snapshot looks good, commits the snapshot as the current table state. This allows reports to be validated before going live.\r\n\r\nI don't think WAP is working as expected under RTAS.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nspark.sql(\"\"\"\r\nCREATE TABLE test.ns.tbl\r\nUSING iceberg\r\nTBLPROPERTIES ('write.wap.enabled'='true')\r\nAS SELECT * FROM VALUES (1, \"Alice\"), (2, \"Bob\") AS (id, fname)\r\n\"\"\")\r\nspark.conf.set(\"spark.wap.id\", \"12345\")\r\nspark.sql(\"\"\"\r\nCREATE OR REPLACE TABLE test.ns.tbl\r\nUSING iceberg\r\nAS SELECT * FROM VALUES (1, 5, \"alice\"), (2, 3, \"bob\") AS (id, name_len, name)\r\n\"\"\")\r\nspark.conf.unset(\"spark.wap.id\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter running this, the schema from the staged change is showing up but the data that _should_ exist isn't accessible, i.e., `DESC test.ns.tbl` shows the new schema and `SELECT * FROM test.ns.tbl` is coming up empty. Even under a simple schema change `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN ...`, the change is taking effect prematurely.\r\n\r\n> Also, the table state can be rolled back to a previous snapshot and new commits will form a new history afterwards.\r\n\r\nI don't believe this changes the notion of what was current at some point in time. If you view the timeline as being from the database's point of view, then rolling back doesn't change the fact that at _some point in time_, a snapshot, that is now inaccessible, was visible in the database.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/702272183/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/702275943","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1495#issuecomment-702275943","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1495","id":702275943,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwMjI3NTk0Mw==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-01T17:11:36Z","updated_at":"2020-10-01T17:11:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks like there are test failures:\r\n\r\n* https://travis-ci.org/github/apache/iceberg/jobs/731967979#L5315-L5319\r\n* https://travis-ci.org/github/apache/iceberg/jobs/731967979#L5359-L5363\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/702275943/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/702278857","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1478#issuecomment-702278857","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1478","id":702278857,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwMjI3ODg1Nw==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-01T17:17:01Z","updated_at":"2020-10-01T17:17:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@marton-bod, we were just talking about test metastores on #1495: https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1495#discussion_r498394239\r\n\r\nI think part of the problem is that this is creating a new metastore instance for each test case.

The reason behind it is really related to Avro.\r\n\r\nBefore I can push TIMESTAMP data type into any standard data model, neither can I create a new field with TIMESTAMP as type, nor replace the bigint epoch_millis with TIMESTAMP.\r\n\r\nI understand that this choice probably does not make much sense to Netflix, because who does not want to use TIMESTAMP natively, huh? But sometimes epoch second/millisecond dies hard, this is why @shardulm94 raised this issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/702440200/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/702450378","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1532#issuecomment-702450378","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1532","id":702450378,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwMjQ1MDM3OA==","user":{"login":"chenjunjiedada","id":3960228,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NjAyMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3960228?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjunjiedada","html_url":"https://github.com/chenjunjiedada","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjunjiedada/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjunjiedada/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjunjiedada/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjunjiedada/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjunjiedada/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjunjiedada/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjunjiedada/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjunjiedada/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjunjiedada/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-01T23:35:43Z","updated_at":"2020-10-01T23:35:43Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Thanks for merging!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/702450378/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/702453101","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1530#issuecomment-702453101","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1530","id":702453101,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwMjQ1MzEwMQ==","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-01T23:46:32Z","updated_at":"2020-10-01T23:46:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks everyone for reviewing!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/702453101/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/702458011","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/417#issuecomment-702458011","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/417","id":702458011,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwMjQ1ODAxMQ==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-02T00:03:50Z","updated_at":"2020-10-02T00:03:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the response, @ericsun2!

But I'll have to think more about whether it's a good idea to do that in Iceberg or not. While I see the utility if you have lots of code that expects this, I'm not sure I'd make it easy to do this for new use cases.\r\n\r\nWe have something similar, where we partition dates by an integer value, like `20201001`. Right now, we have no way to automatically derive these and take advantage of hidden partitioning. I've been considering the idea of custom transform functions to solve this.

That looks good to me.\r\n\r\nWhat I'd like to change is how this is tested. There are two main issues with it. First, the tests are in an unrelated suite for Spark that is mainly testing that Spark works with a variety of different schemas. It doesn't seem appropriate to put the tests for injecting a location provider in a different module and into this suite. Second, the `TestLocationProvider` returns real paths and the tests work by writing data files and validating that files are underneath those paths. That does test that it works, but I think this makes validation much harder. This approach requires a lot of test code and runs a lot of unrelated cases through to validate the location provider.\r\n\r\nI would prefer a more targeted test in a new suited in core, `TestLocationProvider`. That would have a case that injects a `TestLocationProvider` that keeps track of calls in static variables, so you'd be able to inject the provider, get it from `table.operations().locationProvider()`, call some methods, and validate that `TestLocationProvider` received the calls.\r\n\r\nWe also need negative tests for when the provider can't be found.

I'm embarrassed that I misread the specification and thought equality deletes were at the file level. At the partition level makes sense given how manifest files work. However, for their usage by a relational `DELETE` query, storing them in separate files is still very expensive at read time, since we have to do a file read for a single value.\r\n\r\nI can think of a couple of ways to address this cost:\r\n\r\n* Allow storing the equality delete inline in the manifest (we could have a strict or recommended size limit)\r\n* Share the same equality delete file across multiple partitions (is this allowed? how does cleanup work?)\r\n\r\nWe might also allow predicates in the inline version, as the inline version would be limited to a small number of predicates. Since they are at the partition level, they are naturally filtered to partitions that existed at the time of the delete. Maybe think of this as a third type of delete operation, rather than as a special variant of equality delete.\r\n\r\nEquality deletes in external files for CDC operations by row ID is clever and makes sense, as it makes those operations far less expensive (no need to read the original files and join to find the matching rows). I had not considered that type of operation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/702997838/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/703018707","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1469#issuecomment-703018707","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1469","id":703018707,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwMzAxODcwNw==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-03T01:02:12Z","updated_at":"2020-10-03T01:02:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@aokolnychyi, I updated this to support all of the cases in your table.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/703018707/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/703030934","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1499#issuecomment-703030934","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1499","id":703030934,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwMzAzMDkzNA==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-03T02:14:25Z","updated_at":"2020-10-03T02:14:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> However, for their usage by a relational DELETE query, storing them in separate files is still very expensive at read time, since we have to do a file read for a single value.\r\n\r\nFor a relational DELETE query, I would either encode it as a global equality delete, or scan through data files and use position deletes. Position deletes are the best for readers, so we generally want `DELETE FROM` to use them. Equality deletes are mostly for cases where you can't find where the matching rows are, like streaming.\r\n\r\nAnd just to be clear, equality delete files can have an arbitrary number of deletes, one per row. While in the worst case it could be a file read for a single delete, we would not expect that in normal operation.\r\n\r\nI don't think I would add deletes inline in manifests. That would require a lot of complication in manifests and would greatly expand table-level metadata in some use cases. I'd prefer to keep deletes distributed like data files, instead of centralized like table metadata.\r\n\r\nThe idea to share some equality delete files across partitions has occurred to me, but I think it is reasonable to either use a global delete (that is written once and shared) or a partition-level delete. We can also write a global delete once and have a background process rewrite to partition-level deletes. If you need to write fast, then use a global. For more targeted reads, use partition-level.\r\n\r\nAnd better yet, use position deletes to minimize overhead. I really don't see equality deletes being used for SQL cases, because position deletes are so much better for readers. If there isn't time to find the data, use a global delete, but then rewrite to position deletes -- not equality -- because that's better as long as you're doing work in the background.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/703030934/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/703048101","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1531#issuecomment-703048101","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1531","id":703048101,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwMzA0ODEwMQ==","user":{"login":"mickjermsurawong-stripe","id":42550941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNTUwOTQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42550941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickjermsurawong-stripe","html_url":"https://github.com/mickjermsurawong-stripe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickjermsurawong-stripe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickjermsurawong-stripe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickjermsurawong-stripe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickjermsurawong-stripe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickjermsurawong-stripe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickjermsurawong-stripe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickjermsurawong-stripe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickjermsurawong-stripe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickjermsurawong-stripe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-03T05:07:43Z","updated_at":"2020-10-03T05:07:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rdblue, ah thank you for the feedback on test!

That is unexpected because the test should be using an Iceberg implementation of Spark's `TableCatalog` for all of these operations. Can you find out what catalog was being used? My guess is that it was the built-in [`spark_catalog`](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/1772f4f27b8a12d3e89a7f65b8b600b717e1f09d/spark3/src/test/java/org/apache/iceberg/spark/SparkCatalogTestBase.java#L66-L71) and that somehow the session catalog wrapper that we injected did not correctly detect that this table is Iceberg and not Hive.\r\n\r\nI guess this is a spark bug.\r\n\r\nWhat I see is that the spark_catalog is correctly set (CatalogManager.defaultSessionCatalog is the original inner HiveSessionCatalog, but the CatalogManager.catalogs has a value for spark_catalog pointing to our very own SparkSessionCatalog).\r\nSadly this code does not trigger DropTable command creation during the planning:\r\n```\r\n    case DropTableStatement(NonSessionCatalogAndTable(catalog, tbl), ifExists, _) =>\r\n      DropTable(catalog.asTableCatalog, tbl.asIdentifier, ifExists)\r\n```\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/v3.0.0/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/analysis/ResolveCatalogs.scala#L175-L176\r\n\r\nI know from debugging that the NonSessionCatalogAndTable is None (since with spark_catalog we replace session catalog so it is not a NonSessionCatalogAndTable), so I guess we do not translate the DropTableStatement to DropTable.\r\nWe fall back to ResolvaSessionCatalog and convert the statement to DropTableCommand which does not care about the catalog\r\n```\r\n    case DropTableStatement(TempViewOrV1Table(name), ifExists, purge) =>\r\n      DropTableCommand(name.asTableIdentifier, ifExists, isView = false, purge = purge)\r\n```\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/v3.0.0/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/analysis/ResolveSessionCatalog.scala#L331-L332\r\n\r\nMy theory is that we are missing the checks and different code paths for V2 providers which we have for CreateTableStatement for example:\r\n```\r\n      if (!isV2Provider(provider)) {\r\n[..]\r\n      } else {\r\n[..]\r\n      }\r\n```\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/v3.0.0/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/analysis/ResolveSessionCatalog.scala#L248\r\n\r\nSo to summarize the things again:\r\n- This is a Spark bug, where the `ResolveSessionCatalog` should use different code for V1 and V2 providers when a DropTableStatement is issued\r\n\r\n@rdblue: I am not an expert in Scala, so happy to hear any objections if I made mistakes. Does my analysis makes sense? How should we proceed?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nPeter ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/703850831/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/703852389","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1505#issuecomment-703852389","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1505","id":703852389,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwMzg1MjM4OQ==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-05T19:52:15Z","updated_at":"2020-10-05T19:52:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"If it's a Spark bug, then let's just add an `Assume` for the failing test to exclude it when the catalog is `spark_catalog`.

Unless we want specific tests in spark sql to have `engine.hive.enabled` set to `true` and test this code path as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/703903819/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/703929659","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1531#issuecomment-703929659","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1531","id":703929659,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwMzkyOTY1OQ==","user":{"login":"mickjermsurawong-stripe","id":42550941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNTUwOTQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42550941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickjermsurawong-stripe","html_url":"https://github.com/mickjermsurawong-stripe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickjermsurawong-stripe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickjermsurawong-stripe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickjermsurawong-stripe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickjermsurawong-stripe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickjermsurawong-stripe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickjermsurawong-stripe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickjermsurawong-stripe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickjermsurawong-stripe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickjermsurawong-stripe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-05T22:47:54Z","updated_at":"2020-10-05T22:47:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"thanks @rdblue for the review so far!

I think we still need something like that (for existing tables and those created without the config changes in this PR) but we also need a section describing how that can automatically be done at Table creation time from this PR and the `hive-site.xml` etc.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/704320460/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/704358007","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1495#issuecomment-704358007","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1495","id":704358007,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwNDM1ODAwNw==","user":{"login":"pvary","id":19705742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzA1NzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19705742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary","html_url":"https://github.com/pvary","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-06T15:38:01Z","updated_at":"2020-10-06T15:38:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> I reran to see if the tests were flaky and it failed.\r\n\r\nYeah, seen those before too - some flaky stuff I have to investigate. 😢 \r\nThis is the one on my list 😄 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/704358007/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/704386809","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/1513#issuecomment-704386809","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1513","id":704386809,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwNDM4NjgwOQ==","user":{"login":"stevenzwu","id":1545663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDU2NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1545663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu","html_url":"https://github.com/stevenzwu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-06T16:09:56Z","updated_at":"2020-10-06T16:09:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rdblue your suggestion makes sense to me.
