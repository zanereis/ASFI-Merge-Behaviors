For example, how would they know if they should add a \"ms\" or \"cs\" considering the production of a message is literally an rpc (usually http) call? I noted that we still have the option to not do this change, or to instead repurpose \"cs\" \"sr\" to address one-way concerns. For example, thrift and other RPC systems have a one-way specialization.\r\n\r\nIt is important to think about things like this, but also understand tactical vs strategic change. For example, any annotations like this are tactical in my view. I'll try to recap some of this (which came from a gitter chat with @jcarres-mdsol)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI think that linked traces are a better fit for messaging than these annotations. The issue with linked traces is we need to change schema (which isn't a problem, just something to get through)\r\n\r\nThe \"ms\" \"mr\" was a way to identify a means to handle one-way for those in the brown field, because it requires very little change (similar to if we decided to treat \"cs\" \"sr\" missing response, as a special one-way). So, presence of some heuristic for one-way doesn't preclude linked traces, or even handle it better in any way. It is merely a stepping stone.\r\n\r\nHere are the steps I'm thinking of that lead us forward with regards to messaging:\r\n* implement some way to address one-way for current model\r\n* implement single-host span model (aka zipkin model 2 which I think isn't a big bang)\r\n\r\nBoth of the above are independent, but once the latter is in, we can add linked traces to it much easier than trying to add to the multi-host span model we have today.\r\n\r\nBack to the effort here, as far as I can tell, we either proceed as noted or try to repurpose the \"cs\" and \"sr\" similarly. Another option is to not do this and head directly towards links.\r\n\r\nI'll give another couple days to make sure people have seen this and can weigh in if any of this context changes their mind.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/268182230/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/268296580","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/1434#issuecomment-268296580","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1434","id":268296580,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2ODI5NjU4MA==","user":{"login":"cburroughs","id":24433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cburroughs","html_url":"https://github.com/cburroughs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cburroughs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cburroughs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cburroughs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cburroughs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cburroughs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cburroughs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cburroughs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cburroughs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cburroughs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-20T16:57:06Z","updated_at":"2016-12-20T16:57:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"\r\n![debug-info-collapse](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/24433/21359802/659e397c-c6ab-11e6-9d04-f9b2c0aeae2a.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n![debug-info](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/24433/21359775/4cdbac94-c6ab-11e6-95bd-0efef14d57b4.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/268296580/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/268321431","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1278#issuecomment-268321431","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1278","id":268321431,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2ODMyMTQzMQ==","user":{"login":"cburroughs","id":24433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cburroughs","html_url":"https://github.com/cburroughs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cburroughs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cburroughs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cburroughs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cburroughs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cburroughs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cburroughs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cburroughs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cburroughs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cburroughs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-20T18:36:48Z","updated_at":"2016-12-20T18:36:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm unsure how to reproduce this.

I've made following changes:\r\n1. Moved the test code from SpanStoreTest to SpanTest\r\n2. Updated Span.Builder.merge() code to return timestamp and duration of client after merge. However, instead of computing it by going through annotations, I'm calling ApplyTimestampAndDuration.apply(). Since the code is so similar, I didn't want to copy paste. And later if we want to change the logic of computing ApplyTimestampAndDuration, there will be just one place to make the change.

These overlaps usually are consumer induced and signal a lack of domain separation.\r\n\r\nA good article to read on the difference between logging and instrumentation (metrics / tracing / etc) can be found here:\r\n\r\nhttps://peter.bourgon.org/blog/2016/02/07/logging-v-instrumentation.html\r\n\r\nSome confusion might rise due to OpenTracing which while often called a Tracing API is actually more and also allows for abstracting instrumentation like logging and metrics as there are some common denominators making it a candidate to share correlation data and context propagation. See:\r\n\r\nhttp://opentracing.io/documentation/pages/instrumentation/common-use-cases.html\r\n\r\nZipkin strictly deals with Tracing and tracing consumption focus in your applications should be at proper granularity of timing metrics while limiting the amount of attached metadata (that could overlap with logging if done excessively). Metadata is typically added in Zipkin as binary annotations. \r\n\r\nGood rule of thumb, only add the ones needed for querying Zipkin and investigation/assessment of traces and spans. leave out all others or suffer potentially severe performance issues (just like you'd have when using logging as a means to handle needed metrics, for those concerns use a proper metrics system like Prometheus).\r\n\r\nHope this helps. If not feel free to drop by on gitter and discuss some more.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/268825716/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/268833368","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1452#issuecomment-268833368","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1452","id":268833368,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2ODgzMzM2OA==","user":{"login":"eirslett","id":1872593,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NzI1OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1872593?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett","html_url":"https://github.com/eirslett","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-22T16:16:26Z","updated_at":"2016-12-22T16:16:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The problem is with crossroads, which doesn't know what to serve (which route) if it doesn't know about the context path.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/268833368/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/268931024","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1265#issuecomment-268931024","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1265","id":268931024,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2ODkzMTAyNA==","user":{"login":"lookfwd","id":789359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4OTM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/789359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lookfwd","html_url":"https://github.com/lookfwd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lookfwd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lookfwd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lookfwd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lookfwd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lookfwd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lookfwd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lookfwd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lookfwd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lookfwd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-23T02:27:45Z","updated_at":"2016-12-23T02:29:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hello folks, there's been some further progress on the openzipkin/zipkin-python-opentracing#1 .

That, or we should make visible what must happen before a decision can be made. We don't want a worst of show, where we've spent lots of time discussing, and gathering interest, but lose them in analysis paralysis.\r\n\r\nA valid question is what to do when an RPC system is used to carry what is semantically a one-way message. I'd flatten this to the generic topic of one-way RPC, which exists in many systems (regardless if you pay attention to acks or not).\r\n\r\nThis is separate from the concern that led to this issue, which is that a non-RPC system is used to carry single-producer single-consumer messages. The latter concern is addressed by ad-hoc users today, using annotations which may or may not be named \"ms\" and \"mr\" :)\r\n\r\nIf we feel those in the latter camp should continue to work ad-hoc, that's a valid thing, but I think people should be more explicit about the desire to halt this, and what, if anything it would be replaced with. We'd then close the issue as won't fix and stop spending time on it.\r\n\r\nIf we feel there's something that must be addressed, let's make test cases for that. They can be simple descriptions. Regardless, we need to find a way to progress this topic.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/269408921/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/269428480","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1456#issuecomment-269428480","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1456","id":269428480,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2OTQyODQ4MA==","user":{"login":"dragontree101","id":1763935,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NjM5MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1763935?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dragontree101","html_url":"https://github.com/dragontree101","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dragontree101/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dragontree101/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dragontree101/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dragontree101/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dragontree101/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dragontree101/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dragontree101/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dragontree101/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dragontree101/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-28T05:34:28Z","updated_at":"2016-12-28T05:34:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"maybe i don't set jvm param, i set jvm param and restart i seem ok.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/269428480/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/269445354","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1457#issuecomment-269445354","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1457","id":269445354,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2OTQ0NTM1NA==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-28T08:42:52Z","updated_at":"2016-12-28T08:42:52Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"yeah it would be a buffer/pipeline issue. you could buffer more in instrumentation or introduce buffering on the server.\r\n\r\nEx in kafka it is safe to try to collect more because the backlog is persistent.

While cutting off after a certain date is a good idea I think a better alternative is to add a mechanism to cache the service and span names in the persistent layer. That way we can run an expensive query periodically and cache accurate data instead of returning incomplete data every time.  The current model of relying on HTTP caching is too expensive when a lot of users use the zipkin UI and is not scalable(for us) in the long run.
