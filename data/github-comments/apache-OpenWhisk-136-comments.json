So there are two parts to problem\r\n\r\n### Controller Stable Id\r\n\r\nHere requirement is that current approach may lead to orphan topics in Kafka if controller restarts and chooses a new id for every run. So here we either go for stable id or have a way in Kafka to expire topics which do not see some activity after some time\r\n\r\n### Invoker Stable Id\r\n\r\nCurrently Invokers make use of `--name` parameter to be provided a unique name which is then used to find a mapping id from zookeeper. The problem (at least for Mesos) is that there is no stable unique name parameter value to use. One can use the host ip but then it would vary if the next restart leads to  container being placed on different host.\r\n\r\nLooking at [kube][1] setup it looks like it is using [StatefulSet][2] to keep stable id across restarts. So for Mesos we can also use similar [Persistent Volume][3] \r\n\r\nHowever I am not sure if using stateful feature of container runtime should be the way to go as it would cause issue in case that node gives a problem or goes offline. In such a case invoker would be started on a new node and that would cause the topic to become orphan leaving activations present in  it unprocessed.\r\n\r\nHence the search for newer approach\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-deploy-kube/blob/489ce8e90abf3bc411f8dd7087d42916c8a004be/helm/openwhisk/templates/invoker.yaml#L99\r\n[2]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/\r\n[3]: https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/persistent-volumes.html","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/404046183/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/404046455","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/3858#issuecomment-404046455","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/3858","id":404046455,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNDA0NjQ1NQ==","user":{"login":"chetanmeh","id":664531,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NDUzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/664531?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chetanmeh","html_url":"https://github.com/chetanmeh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chetanmeh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chetanmeh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chetanmeh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chetanmeh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chetanmeh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chetanmeh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chetanmeh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chetanmeh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chetanmeh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-11T05:07:17Z","updated_at":"2018-07-11T05:13:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> How about using akka clustering for id mapping resolution?\r\n\r\n@tysonnorris Missed that we can also use that.

The concern is mostly stale topics in Kafka, correct?\r\n\r\nSo for the Controller, that shouldn't be much of an issue if we just garbage collect stale topics after, say, 24 hours of inactivity. Inactivity means: No consumers connected for that time. There might even be a way to configure Kafka to do that.\r\n\r\nSame for the invokers. Yes, there might be a (small) amount of activations residing on a topic when an invoker is disappearing. But not that these would be lost if they went into the invoker anyway. That amount should be very small (< `invokerBusyThreshold`) and that is the amount of messages that we allow to get lost anyway?\r\n\r\nFor the overflow case of course, this is different. We should strive for the overflow queue there though vs. fixing the ID mappings.\r\n\r\nAnother angle to this is: Instead of trying to fix invoker id assignments (which are kinda important to be increments of 1) should we try to find an algorithm, that doesn't rely on numbered invokers at all?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/404059138/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/404138534","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/3855#issuecomment-404138534","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/3855","id":404138534,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNDEzODUzNA==","user":{"login":"vvraskin","id":7526585,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MjY1ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7526585?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvraskin","html_url":"https://github.com/vvraskin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvraskin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvraskin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvraskin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvraskin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvraskin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvraskin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvraskin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvraskin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvraskin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-11T11:37:23Z","updated_at":"2018-07-11T11:37:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I‚Äôve updated the PR so that I send an invoker name in the form via health protocol. \r\n```\r\n{\"invoker0/$uniqueName/$displayedName\":\"up\"}\r\n```\r\nI agree that reading the invoker displayed name from env is an additional level where the config is read from.

Inactivity means: No consumers connected for that time. There might even be a way to configure Kafka to do that.\r\n\r\nDid not found any out of the box Kafka feature to do that. So we would need to have some tooling to do the purge. May be we add that support in `wskadmin-next`\r\n\r\n> For the overflow case of course, this is different. We should strive for the overflow queue there though vs. fixing the ID mappings.\r\n\r\nMy concern was more for overflow case. As there would always be case where OW capacity may be limited and in case of burst of events the queue size may grow large. So yes probably overflow queue concept should be implemented\r\n\r\n> Another angle to this is: Instead of trying to fix invoker id assignments (which are kinda important to be increments of 1) should we try to find an algorithm, that doesn't rely on numbered invokers at all?\r\n\r\nWell thinking about this it appears what we are doing is similar to what Kafka would be doing internally via partitions support. If you have a single queue and multiple invokers form a consumer group then internally Kafka would parition the queue and allocate the partitions to individual invokers. So it would internally take care of sequential numbering of partitions.\r\n\r\nSo just for thought process lets say if we have a single Kafka queue and then following model can be implemented\r\n\r\n1. The global topic use action name + namespace as partition key\r\n2. Multiple invokers form a consumer group and subscribe to the above topic \r\n3. Each invoker then processed activations from the assigned partitions.\r\n\r\nSuch an approach would enable\r\n\r\n1. Single stable topic\r\n2. Simplify scaling by adding new invokers to share load and let Kafka rebalance the partitions to consumer group members\r\n3. Partitioning by action + namespace would ensure stickiness to the invoker and would have same effect as current sharding load balancer strategy

These are valid cases to consider an invoker unusable?\r\n\r\nto 2.: Again, I think this is a valid case of general overload. If there are too many active-acks for whatever reason, its safer to call the system done than continue to process with more crpytic errors (timeouts, crashes etc.)\r\n\r\nWDYT?
