The Datasource V2 API is marked evolving and the API changed from Spark 2.3 to 2.4 and it will change again in Spark 3.0. The DataSource v2 connector in this patch will only work with Spark 2.4. \r\nI deprecated but did not remove the current connector that uses the V1 API, so users should still be able to use the current connector. \r\nThere is a JIRA to move all the connectors to their own repo (see [PHOENIX-5062](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PHOENIX-5062)) which will allow us to release the connectors independently of phoenix core. I was planning on working on that after this PR goes in. \r\n\r\nFor 2) are you referring to ```PhoenixRecordWritable```? That class is deprecated and only used in the old connector. \r\nSpark has code to convert from/to a ResultSet to/from InternalRow which I used (see ```SparkJdbcUtil```). The setters methods are accessible, but there is a bug in handling ```ByteType```, so I had to copy the code. This will be fixed in [SPARK-26499](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-26499) after which we can switch to just using Spark's ```JdbcUtils.resultSetToSparkInternalRows```\r\nThe setters methods are not accessible, so I had to create a copy of them (see ```makeSetter``` in ```SparkJdbcUtil```).

As you already pointed out, the simplest way to combat that is to retry the whole job again (or at certain intervals) and hope that it eventually succeeds. If not, we can raise appropriate alerts using monitoring infrastructure.\r\n\r\n> In this case, I want the retry job to skip the regions whose stats have already been updated and only do minimal work, so it wouldn't worsen the bad situation in the cluster and we can easily catch up to avoid missing SLA.

Determining which regions data is missing from SYSTEM.STATS table is not possible (as part of this code) since the snapshot might have changed between the two jobs. \r\nA better way (in my understanding) of implementing this feature would be wrapper class for this tool which is aware about the job id and other details for the previous job. It can ensure that the job runs on the same snapshot everytime and mappers are only spawned accordingly (or even if mappers are launched, most of them are no-op). At this point, I feel that we should skip it, however feel free to add this as an potential enhancement to PHOENIX-5091.
