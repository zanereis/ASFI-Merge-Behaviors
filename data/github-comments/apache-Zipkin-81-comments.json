I assume this can't be easily fixed with alias trickery, right? `2019-01-01` pointing to `2019-01-01-00` and you switch that every hour. As long as the alias is pointing to a single index you can write to it. Pointing to multiple indices makes it read-only.\r\n2. Probably the better approach long-term is a [rollover index](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.5/indices-rollover-index.html) where you can specify a certain age or number of docs or size. I'd generally go for size so you have a very even distribution of data per shard (otherwise weekends might be oversharded and a peak during the week undersharded). Also note that we will very soon have Index Lifecycle Management (ILM) built into Elasticsearch and Kibana, which will make the management of rollover indices and deleting old data much simpler. Though it's under the (free) Basic license and not Apache2 — not sure if that is acceptable to be used in Zipkin

It is one way of getting around the storage period limitation. That is, for a particular interesting trace, you can save it to your local machine or attach it to an issue (e.g. JIRA) so that others can check that trace at any time easily, without having to worry about the original data expiring from the data store. It's a nicer experience than everyone wanting to do this learning how to POST the data to a locally running instance or something.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/459636494/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/459640501","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/2375#issuecomment-459640501","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2375","id":459640501,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1OTY0MDUwMQ==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-01T08:09:44Z","updated_at":"2019-02-01T08:09:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"good
