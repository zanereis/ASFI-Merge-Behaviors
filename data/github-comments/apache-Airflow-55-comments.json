That queue can take hours to clear, and if the scheduler is restarted at any point in that window, we'll have a bunch of orphaned tasks.\n\nWe also use the `CeleryExecutor`, which relies on an external queue mechanism. The queue can be cleared (for example, the Redis instance dies or needs to be restarted), and when this happens, we'll also have a bunch of orphaned tasks.\n\nOverall, it would be great for Airflow to be resilient to restarts and failures. Machines die and services restart all the time, and the oncall who wakes up needs to have simple remediation procedures for handling the failure. Without a way to recover from these cases, it would make the oncall's life much more difficult. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/224484410/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/224488844","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1577#issuecomment-224488844","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1577","id":224488844,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNDQ4ODg0NA==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-08T05:09:02Z","updated_at":"2016-06-08T05:09:02Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"LGTM\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/224488844/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/224490182","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1514#issuecomment-224490182","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1514","id":224490182,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNDQ5MDE4Mg==","user":{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-08T05:18:36Z","updated_at":"2016-06-08T05:18:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@plypaul in case of celery that is a really short time frame: it gets to scheduled at the moment of sending it to the executor (thus celery). So if you get in between that moment yes you can get a orphaned task at the moment although chances imho are very slim. This can be further eliminated by surrounding the \"send to executor\" with the \"for_update_block\" this way the record wont get updated if sending to the executor fails.\n\nIn addition the executor should set a state when it picks up the task.

Scheduler processes DAGs, and if a task instance needs to be run, it is created in the ORM in the `SCHEDULED` state and added to the queue of tasks that should be sent to the executor. Task instances already in the `SCHEDULED` state do not get added to the queue.\n2. Once all the DAG files have been processed, task instances are examined and sent to the executor.\n3. The executor runs the task. When the task runs, the state of the task changes from `SCHEDULED` to `RUNNING`.\n\nWhen there are many DAGs, step 1 can take a long time. In our case, it's about 6 minutes. If the scheduler exits between steps 1 and 2, there will be orphaned tasks and the 6 minute window is fairly large.\n\nAlso, the state of the task does not change when it's sent to the executor. The state of the task only changes when the task is actually run. With the `CeleryExecutor`, the task would stay in the `SCHEDULED` state until a worker becomes free, picks the task from the Redis queue, and runs it. On busy moments, the task can be in either the internal executor queue or the Redis queue for many minutes. If the scheduler restarts while the task is in the internal executor queue, there will be orphaned tasks. Likewise, if the Redis queue is cleared, there will be orphaned tasks.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/224498317/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/224500691","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1514#issuecomment-224500691","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1514","id":224500691,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNDUwMDY5MQ==","user":{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-08T06:27:24Z","updated_at":"2016-06-08T06:27:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ah

Applying the previous state logic would just mean also evaluating the scheduled status and and re-scheduling those taskinstances everytime and let the taskinstance at run time figure out what to do. This is what the previous scheduler did with\"none\" states. That's kind of a one-liner. \n\nWhat I would suggest is to move the \"set to scheduled state\" to when it the taskinstance is sent to the executor. This resolves the orphaning when the scheduler is killed and is a small change. \n\nFor the garbage collector we can add a time stamp last_updated to the task_instance which will get set everytime the record is updated (or a state change happens). The scheduler can then do a simple sweep by sql statement to set the state to \"none\" or to a new \"reschedule\" state by comparing it to an arbitrary timeout value. This would be orphaning down the line and would be future proof. Also a one liner. \n\nOr even better we could ask the executor which tasks it knows about and compare that to the list of scheduled tasks. If they are not there reschedule them. This is a little bit more work and might need to be combined with the above one as in the past the reporting by the executor was not really trustworthy. \n\nWhat do you think?

Moving the \"setting schedule state\" to when it gets sent to the executor closes one as the DB safe guards against a kill of the scheduler by not committing the transaction. The second one is the time between the handover from the executor to the worker by means of the MQ (and then after not setting a different state).\n\nIndeed asking the executor for the information should work. The timeout would just safe guard defensively against the executor not reporting back correctly. It 'lost' tasks in the past therefore @jlowin reverted some logic in process_queued_tasks before the release of 1.7.1 .\n\nSo yes I think we are on the right track :). Let's see if asking the executor solves the issue, but I do think scanning for orphaned tasks might be nice to have in also to also safe guard against any future changes.

For example, there is now a State.SCHEDULED that I think would need to be accounted for -- right now it looks to me like only QUEUED and UP_FOR_RETRY tasks ever get sent to the executor, and the reframing of QUEUED semantics encompasses some of the reasons for which the SCHEDULED state was introduced. @bolkedebruin I think you'll need to weigh in on the degree to which things like that need to be accounted for.\n\nHere's a thought. I think we all agree that serializing DAGs (as pickles) and then unserializing them when needed is a Good Thing. However, Dags are often unpickleable -- I think because of jinja templates, iirc. Does the use of SimpleDag get around this? Can we pass around SimpleDag objects via the db and avoid having to always parse the entire dag file?

If it were possible, the benefits would be great - task execution becomes more consistent and deployment would be simpler on the workers. One of the things that came up in discussion was that in order to support something like that, we would need to restrict the set of operations that the user can do.
