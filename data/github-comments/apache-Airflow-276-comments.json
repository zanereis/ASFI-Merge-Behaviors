Setting `timeout_seconds` here causes other methods, such as `create_namespaced_pod` to fail as this property is not recognized. If the ask here is to make this configurable, we'd need do so by adding another parameter to the `airflow.cfg` as to not break current functionality.\r\n\r\nMy approach assumes that `_request_timeout` being set to 60 as the default in the config was deliberate so I wanted to be under this value by a considerable margin. That said, querying the API should realistically never take more than about 1s.\r\n\r\nIf we didn't want to \"hard-code\" this value here, the other approaches I see are:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new config parameter, `watch_timeout_seconds`\r\n2. `if \"_request_timeout\" in kube_client_request_args then timeout_seconds = kube_client_request_args['_request_timeout'] - 1`\r\n3.

I am more than fine with relying on pytest's feature now allowing to specify path of the file to test + some explanation in BREEZE as well as in the \"run-tests\" hints about using -k flag and ::test_method. This is so much more straightforward now with pytest\r\n\r\nThe only custom and useful part of `run-tests` was the `--with-db-init` flag. So I added it as a custom pytest plugin with additional session fixture, this also allowed to simplify some scripts. As a result running tests in Breeze goes down to using pure pytest 🚀 This includes getting help as `pytest --help` includes:\r\n```\r\nairflow:\r\n  --with-db-init        Forces database initialization before tests\r\n``` ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/559545925/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/559549837","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6657#issuecomment-559549837","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6657","id":559549837,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1OTU0OTgzNw==","user":{"login":"TobKed","id":32594847,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNTk0ODQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32594847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobKed","html_url":"https://github.com/TobKed","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobKed/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobKed/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobKed/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobKed/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobKed/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobKed/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobKed/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobKed/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobKed/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-28T16:16:59Z","updated_at":"2019-11-28T16:16:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"CC @potiuk @mik-laj \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/559549837/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/559609404","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5883#issuecomment-559609404","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5883","id":559609404,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1OTYwOTQwNA==","user":{"login":"villasv","id":6609289,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MDkyODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6609289?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/villasv","html_url":"https://github.com/villasv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villasv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villasv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villasv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villasv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villasv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villasv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villasv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villasv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villasv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-28T21:57:44Z","updated_at":"2019-11-28T21:57:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yes, it is.

The first seems abandoned (last commit in 2016) and not working with Kerberos auth+encryption, meanwhile the latter works very well with Kerberos, but not with DIGEST-MD5 qop auth-conf (encryption, only auth is supported). The last version of `snakebite-py3` uses pure-sasl because it works really well, I opened an issue to see if the new feature can be added: https://github.com/thobbs/pure-sasl/issues/32. I don't have a lot of hope since DIGEST-MD5 auth-conf is based on ancient protocols (DES, RC4, etc..) so not really up to the current standards of AES. The Hadoop Datanode protocol seems to require it during negotiation of AES encryption (yes very ironic)..\r\n\r\nThe `sasl` lib (https://github.com/cloudera/python-sasl/tree/master/sasl) is a wrapper around the Cyrus SASL library, that should support it, but sadly I wasn't able to make it work with Kerberos (so I was blocked one step before the current issue). There is a pull request to refresh the bindings (https://github.com/cloudera/python-sasl/pull/15), but nobody from upstream is paying attention. If you know anybody from Cloudera that can help, we may have a way forward :)\r\n\r\nJust to clarify, `snakebite-py3` now supports kerberos and works well in all the use cases, except when full encryption is requested. So currently it is doing what its python2/3 version supported, what I am trying to add is something more that was not added before. No idea if the airflow community really needs it (enough to block 2.0 I mean); if so we could work on replacing snakebite with pyarrow (even if it was tried before and I didn't get exactly what blocked the migration). Let me know :)\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/559814094/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/559820954","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6596#issuecomment-559820954","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6596","id":559820954,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1OTgyMDk1NA==","user":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-29T15:17:27Z","updated_at":"2019-11-29T15:17:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"We
