you are correct, there is a regression problem with non-normal scoped beans.  The code works.  Specifically for dependent and singleton, since they're not using proxies, the instance you get back is the same.  This essentially makes dependent == singleton.\n\nYou can see that the test does include both normal scoped and dependent beans https://github.com/johnament/cxf/tree/81e9215b75c02a6b108e94f474b9aa6011c8f00c/systests/cdi/base/src/main/java/org/apache/cxf/systests/cdi/base - look at BookStore and VersionService as examples.\n\nThe code does work, but I would expect a per-request pattern to be used for dependent.
