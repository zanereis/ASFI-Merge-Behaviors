Endusers would expect the cron will always run as 'user1'.\r\n\r\n2) One more valid but yet uncovered use case left in my mind (dealing with permissions):\r\n- interpreter permissions have been set only for groups (e.g. DepartmentA should be allowed to run spark interpreter)\r\n- user created note with %spark interpreter and schedules a cron\r\n- now when cron runs, **only username is added to authentication info. groups of the user (e.g. DepartmentA in that example) are omitted** and the notebook fails with an error, that **user 'xyz' has no permission for running the interpreter**.\r\n\r\nany chance to fix that case as well? \r\nI think of something like introducing cronExecutingRoles (in addition to  cronExecutingUser) and adding all roles of the user who enables the cron to that config property. And then when a cron runs, all that roles are added to the corresponding authentication info.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/383326124/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/383353651","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2859#issuecomment-383353651","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2859","id":383353651,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MzM1MzY1MQ==","user":{"login":"felixcheung","id":8969467,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5Njk0Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8969467?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung","html_url":"https://github.com/felixcheung","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-22T03:59:52Z","updated_at":"2018-04-22T03:59:52Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"could

It's what we need to discuss. I, basically, make a new PR for handing version issue for it, but we need to discuss how to manage interpreters' version. Before that, we need to provide a script to get valid helium menu. I plan to make a new issue for handling this.\r\n1. This is also similar issue the above one. We, currently, don't have any rule for matching installed one and installable one because, in case of `pig`, there's no strict naming rule for pig directory, but you just coded to copy files into `interpreter/pig` directory. In this time, I agree that I should map heuristic to prevent well-known interpreters from installing twice in a different directory.\r\n1. I know this issue. To handle this one, we need to solve the first and second one. How about solving this issue with a seperate PR? Concerning this issue, more important one is to mark already installed interpreters when showing that menu.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/383465551/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/383469438","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2935#issuecomment-383469438","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2935","id":383469438,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MzQ2OTQzOA==","user":{"login":"jongyoul","id":3612566,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTI1NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3612566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul","html_url":"https://github.com/jongyoul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-23T06:35:04Z","updated_at":"2018-04-23T06:35:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Removed all of the synchronized blocks from `InterpreterSettingManager` for `interpreterSettings`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/383469438/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/383470698","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2935#issuecomment-383470698","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2935","id":383470698,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MzQ3MDY5OA==","user":{"login":"zjffdu","id":164491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu","html_url":"https://github.com/zjffdu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-23T06:42:07Z","updated_at":"2018-04-23T06:42:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"THanks @jongyoul Just several minor issues, rest look good to me.

To clarify it, if you install `zeppelin-pig` in a UI, the logic would check if `zeppelin-pig` and `pig` exist. If both don't exist, the logic would install `zeppelin-pig` in the directory of `interpreter/zeppelin-pig`. The reason why I keep the name is that I don't think it's good to change interpreter name with our current unruled format. currently, `zeppelin-pig` is extracted by maven artifact name. If we could make a helium file with interpreter name 'pig', we could install `interpreter/pig`. I think it's one of the realistic solutions to handle the name of interpreters.
