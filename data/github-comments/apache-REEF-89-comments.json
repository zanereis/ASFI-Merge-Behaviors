Thanks for the feedback!\r\n\r\n> Now HelloREEF works, but I am still concerned about this change. It does not solve the original problem, i.e. the JARs being copied to the current directory. Not only HelloREEF leaves these files in the current directory, it also crashes if that directory is not writable (e.g. try to run HelloREEF from C:\\)\r\n\r\nThis PR (and the one it is following) actually seeks to address a separate issue. Specifically, we want to make the client runnable from outside the directory the main assembly sits in. This was previously hardcoded into the client.\r\n\r\nThe issue of the `reef` and `client` JARs being copied to the local directory and how they are treated in the .NET code cuts through a bunch of unrelated parts of the codebase. As discussed in the [JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/REEF-1963), I would prefer to deal with this as a separate issue -- to unify and streamline the way we reference these resources.\r\n\r\nHow would you feel about accepting this fix separately from the JAR issues? I think that the bug you call out -- not being able to run from a non-writable directory -- is something that we can live with for now, as this does not reflect a change of state over the original implementation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/346450402/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/346556326","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/1341#issuecomment-346556326","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/1341","id":346556326,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NjU1NjMyNg==","user":{"login":"nhne","id":17722369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzIyMzY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17722369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhne","html_url":"https://github.com/nhne","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhne/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhne/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhne/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhne/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhne/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhne/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhne/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhne/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhne/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-23T08:33:56Z","updated_at":"2017-11-23T08:33:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@taegeonum Sorry for very late commit!

(once the resource is allocated by the ResourceManager) call the Node Manager to launch the evaluator. Node Manager concept does not exist in Azure Batch. At the time of resource request, the API caller must provide a launch command (see add task API https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/batchservice/task/add). Once Azure Batch allocates a node, it will invoke the given command and consider the task as Active until the command exits.\r\n\r\nIn REEF, ResourceRequestEvent does not contain any information about the evaluator, therefore, we cannot just provide the evaluator launch command in the \"add task\" Batch API call. So instead, we provide the launch command for the evaluator shim. Once Azure Batch allocates a node and starts the evaluator shim process on that node, the evaluator shim will call back to the driver via Wake to signal that the resource request has been fulfilled. On the driver side, we trigger the ResourceAllocationEvent event and wait for ResourceLaunchEvent. Upon receiving the ResourceLaunchEvent, we build the evaluator launch command and send it to the evaluator shim via Wake. Upon receiving the command, the evaluator shim will launch the evaluator. \r\n\r\nI hope my explanation makes sense. Please let me know if anything above is unclear. Also, I realize that \"evaluator shim\" might not be the best name -- if you have any suggestions of what it should be called, I'll be more than happy to change it.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/372398753/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/372401307","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/1433#issuecomment-372401307","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/1433","id":372401307,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MjQwMTMwNw==","user":{"login":"shouhengyi-microsoft","id":17937602,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTM3NjAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17937602?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shouhengyi-microsoft","html_url":"https://github.com/shouhengyi-microsoft","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shouhengyi-microsoft/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shouhengyi-microsoft/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shouhengyi-microsoft/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shouhengyi-microsoft/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shouhengyi-microsoft/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shouhengyi-microsoft/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shouhengyi-microsoft/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shouhengyi-microsoft/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shouhengyi-microsoft/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-12T17:46:50Z","updated_at":"2018-03-12T17:49:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@markusweimer \r\n\r\nThat was one of the points that the team was debating. Therefore we like to see what the REEF community thinks. The alternatives I can think of to fix this issues are\r\n\r\n- Use string instead of Uri. However it breaks the public interface `public bool Exists(Uri fileUri)` to `public bool Exists(string fileUriPath)`. It also goes back to your concern.\r\n- Use C# HDFS client instead of `hdfs` command. However it removes the class `HdfsCommandRunner` which seems like a major change\r\n\r\nTherefore the solution I proposed is to use OriginalString. To answer your question, I think my proposal is sub-optimal since it's string based and we lose the parsing from C#'s Uri class. However, I would like to make two points for this change:\r\n\r\n- Users need to be responsible for providing a valid hdfs path\r\n- Uri class's parsing mechanism doesn't work well with `hdfs` command line tool, because \r\n[System.Uri](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.uri?view=netframework-4.7.1#Remarks) converts the URI scheme to lowercase, converts the host name to lowercase. \r\nEscaped characters (also known as percent-encoded octets) that don't have a reserved purpose are decoded (also known as being unescaped). These unreserved characters include uppercase and lowercase letters (%41-%5A and %61-%7A), decimal digits (%30-%39), hyphen (%2D), period (%2E), underscore (%5F), and tilde (%7E).\r\n\r\nThose constrains put me in a strange situation, if the cluster has a non-standard hostname.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/372401307/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/372515458","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/1432#issuecomment-372515458","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/1432","id":372515458,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MjUxNTQ1OA==","user":{"login":"markusweimer","id":502371,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjM3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/502371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer","html_url":"https://github.com/markusweimer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-13T01:27:28Z","updated_at":"2018-03-13T01:27:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> I hope my explanation makes sense.

Thanks for that!\r\n\r\nThat being said, I wonder how the solution in this PR compares to the following straw man:\r\n\r\n  * The Azure Batch runtime keeps tabs on how many machines `m` it has and how many Evaluators `e` are running.\r\n  * Upon receipt of an `EvaluatorRequest`, it satisfies it instantly, if `e < n`.  Else, it queues the request for satisfaction when an Evaluator is shut down.\r\n\r\nThis is essentially the approach taken in the local runtime. However, there we configure `m` via a parameter of the runtime.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/372515458/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/372749092","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/1432#issuecomment-372749092","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/1432","id":372749092,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3Mjc0OTA5Mg==","user":{"login":"ryumbra","id":22202592,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjAyNTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22202592?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryumbra","html_url":"https://github.com/ryumbra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryumbra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryumbra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryumbra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryumbra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryumbra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryumbra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryumbra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryumbra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryumbra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-13T17:25:56Z","updated_at":"2018-03-13T17:25:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think the solution that we implemented is a little simpler than the one you propose. Upon ResourceRequestEvent we create an Azure Batch task which launches the shim. Upon ResourceReleaseEvent, we send a message to the shim to terminate which causes the Azure Batch task to be marked \"Complete\" and the node to become available for other tasks. So there is no need to track machines or queue EvaluatorRequest objects when \"e > m\". \r\n\r\nIn addition, Azure Batch already has pretty good support for scenarios when the number of pending tasks exceeds the number of available resources. \r\n1. Azure Batch will queue pending tasks and wait for tasks in progress to complete before assigning nodes to the tasks in queue.\r\n2. Users can define scaling formulas on Azure Batch pools which will acquire more VMs when the number of pending tasks satisfies the formula. More on that: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-automatic-scaling. \r\n\r\nFinally, here are two more thoughts on the subject:\r\n1. The proposed solution will enable user to specify the static number of nodes which will be used for executing REEF job. In contrast, our solution will allow the pool to dynamically scale up and down based on the demands of the job.\r\n2. The proposed solution will trade lower latency between ResourceRequestEvent and EvaluatorRequest for higher runtime start-up latency. When we receive a ResourceRequestEvent and e < m, we could trigger ResourceAllocationEvent immediately, instead of creating an AzureBatch task and waiting to hear back from the shim.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/372749092/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/372841072","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/1434#issuecomment-372841072","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/1434","id":372841072,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3Mjg0MTA3Mg==","user":{"login":"dougmsft","id":8461862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NjE4NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8461862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dougmsft","html_url":"https://github.com/dougmsft","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dougmsft/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dougmsft/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dougmsft/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dougmsft/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dougmsft/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dougmsft/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dougmsft/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dougmsft/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dougmsft/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-13T22:31:13Z","updated_at":"2018-03-13T22:31:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Test
