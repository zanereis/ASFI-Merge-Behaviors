no DagRun and task instances exist for a DAG, the first DagRun gets seeded on the min(start_date). \n\nIf there are task instances, the first DagRun is created a few runs before the most recent task instance (5 I believe). This was an arbitrary attempt at keeping the flow when people migrated from `1.4` to `1.5`. It's not perfect, but it worked for most of our 100+ DAGs with little work.\n\nI'm guessing that when you cleared everything, you might have left some orphan task instances behind. Task instances linked to task_ids that are no longer. Anyhow, we shouldn't account for those when getting the set of tasks but we do. You can see those on the \"Task Instances\" view in the UI, they'll show up there even if the tasks have been removed from your DAG.\n\nHere's a link to the related code:\nhttps://github.com/airbnb/airflow/blob/master/airflow/jobs.py#L378\n\nA line that would say `.filter(TI.task_id.in_(DAG.task_ids))` would help disregarding the orphan task_ids...\n\nThe `depends_on_past` logic is somewhat easy to understand though sometimes tricky to deal with. Those tasks depend on the success of their immediate previous instance, except for the start_date since it needs to start somewhere AND for the start_date of a backfill command since otherwise your backfill may never start.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/162137350/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/162138222","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/732#issuecomment-162138222","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/732","id":162138222,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MjEzODIyMg==","user":{"login":"jasminetsai","id":1663847,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjM4NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1663847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasminetsai","html_url":"https://github.com/jasminetsai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasminetsai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasminetsai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasminetsai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasminetsai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasminetsai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasminetsai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasminetsai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasminetsai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasminetsai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-05T04:29:44Z","updated_at":"2015-12-05T04:29:44Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Seems like its only for tasks where depends_on_past is not true.\n<img width=\"323\" alt=\"screen shot 2015-12-04 at 8 20 39 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1663847/11606007/b9955e10-9ac5-11e5-9d5e-753571d16ad4.png\">\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/162138222/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/162162292","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/731#issuecomment-162162292","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/731","id":162162292,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MjE2MjI5Mg==","user":{"login":"r39132","id":581734,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MTczNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/581734?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132","html_url":"https://github.com/r39132","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-05T08:56:00Z","updated_at":"2015-12-05T08:56:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The exception `UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\\x98' in position 27: ordinal not in range(128)` may point the way?

Or like `_set_relatives`, we could pass a boolean argument `upstream` to indicate which list to add the element too, still without having to past the protected list as an argument.\n\nWhat do you think ?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/162329661/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/162332648","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/735#issuecomment-162332648","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/735","id":162332648,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MjMzMjY0OA==","user":{"login":"wndhydrnt","id":3942978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDI5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3942978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wndhydrnt","html_url":"https://github.com/wndhydrnt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wndhydrnt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wndhydrnt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wndhydrnt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wndhydrnt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wndhydrnt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wndhydrnt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wndhydrnt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wndhydrnt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wndhydrnt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-06T18:06:40Z","updated_at":"2015-12-06T18:06:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mistercrunch Removed lines 223-224\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/162332648/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/162446862","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/729#issuecomment-162446862","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/729","id":162446862,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MjQ0Njg2Mg==","user":{"login":"hirolau","id":352885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Mjg4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/352885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hirolau","html_url":"https://github.com/hirolau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hirolau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hirolau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hirolau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hirolau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hirolau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hirolau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hirolau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hirolau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hirolau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-07T08:26:23Z","updated_at":"2015-12-07T08:26:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I was using 1.6.

I think we can build up on top of this in order to move the whole log config to a file, and it will require to carefully re-do all the logic with the different logging format specified in [cli.py](https://github.com/airbnb/airflow/blob/732297b7f561c4b647b3557a841525b514fe64c0/airflow/bin/cli.py) + probably provide a different config file for the Travis builds to re-obtain the `--logging-level=DEBUG` behaviour currently used during the tests. \n\nI'd rather not include that change in the present PR though. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/162856150/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/162872131","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/740#issuecomment-162872131","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/740","id":162872131,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2Mjg3MjEzMQ==","user":{"login":"max-sixty","id":5635139,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MzUxMzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5635139?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-sixty","html_url":"https://github.com/max-sixty","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-sixty/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-sixty/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-sixty/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-sixty/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-sixty/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-sixty/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-sixty/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-sixty/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-sixty/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-08T12:55:28Z","updated_at":"2015-12-08T12:55:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@svendx4f Thanks, looks great!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/162872131/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/162910276","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/731#issuecomment-162910276","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/731","id":162910276,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MjkxMDI3Ng==","user":{"login":"005f","id":8728205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MjgyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8728205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/005f","html_url":"https://github.com/005f","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/005f/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/005f/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/005f/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/005f/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/005f/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/005f/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/005f/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/005f/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/005f/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-08T15:10:58Z","updated_at":"2015-12-08T15:10:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"1.6.1.
