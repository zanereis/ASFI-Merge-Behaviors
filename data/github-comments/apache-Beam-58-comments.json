I like the idea of having something high level in `runners-core` but there is so little here that I'm not sure what would be factored out. In fact, use of `GroupAlsoByWindowsViaWindowSetDoFn` forces a particular materialization of timers, while each runner might just like to use their own representation.\n\nTo be clear, you've also reproduced the late data dropping, which might be nice to have a way to re-use.\n\nAnd it can be further shrunk (not needed for this PR). `ReduceFnRunner.onTimer(TimerData)` actually doesn't need the timer data, it just needs to fire EOW panes, fire trigger panes, and GC. The `TimerData` is just a hint about which windows to process.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/257947384/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/257956032","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/1260#issuecomment-257956032","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/1260","id":257956032,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1Nzk1NjAzMg==","user":{"login":"jkff","id":343722,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MzcyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/343722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff","html_url":"https://github.com/jkff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-02T18:26:09Z","updated_at":"2016-11-02T18:26:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Oops, forgot to checkstyle.
