I did an audit of the usages of all the renamed exceptions. They are all retriable, and are handled in `JoinGroup`, `SyncGroup`, the heartbeat thread, and during offset commits.\r\n\r\nIn all cases but one, the operations are retried when they hit a retriable exception, so these should not be returned to the client. \r\n\r\nThe one case where the behavior is unclear is in `commitOffsetsAsync()` : https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/consumer/internals/ConsumerCoordinator.java#L524\r\n\r\nI think in this case, the exception is returned to the user. If this true, it seems like we will have to either: \r\n\r\n1. Introduce new error codes and exceptions for the transaction coordinator.\r\n2. Reuse the `GroupCoordinator` errors and exception codes for the transaction coordinator. \r\n\r\nNeither of these is ideal, but seems unavoidable unless I am wrong. \r\n\r\n@ijuma : in the async offsets commit path, am I reading the code wrong?

I had a close look and I think it makes the code easier to read, so I am OK with merging it with a few tweaks (https://github.com/jozi-k/kafka/pull/1).\r\n\r\n@jozi-k, regarding the comment about mutable case classes, it is understood that it's not a good practice. In reality, `LeaderAndIsr` probably doesn't need to be a case class, so that could be fixed that way too. I think it's important to understand that some of the code in Kafka has been around for a while and is lacking tests. So, we tend to be extra careful when making ad-hoc changes to such code. As a general rule, it's better to think about the end state and then work out the steps to get there.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/293295416/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/293297360","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2832#issuecomment-293297360","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2832","id":293297360,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MzI5NzM2MA==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-11T15:19:18Z","updated_at":"2017-04-11T15:19:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nRefer
