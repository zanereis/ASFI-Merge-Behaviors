All the federated tests seem to be failing because of it. Can you see if anything looks wrong in this rebased version of FederatedWorker.java?: https://github.com/sebwrede/systemds/blob/1f8f6ed84ef3cd5c996e443005820e33bb43c1c8/src/main/java/org/apache/sysds/runtime/controlprogram/federated/FederatedWorker.java\r\n\r\nAnother problem is running the InOutTest.

I get the following error:\r\n\r\n`/systemds/src/main/cpp/he/libhe.cpp:23:10: fatal error: gsl/span: No such file or directory\r\n   23 | #include <gsl/span>\r\n      |          ^~~~~~~~~~\r\ncompilation terminated.\r\n`\r\n\r\nSo one idea could be to include a check for whether gsl/span is there in the build.sh before trying to compile and then install before the compilation.

A simple `FederationUtils.resetFedDataID()` at the beginning of the test mitigated the described problem, which however pointed to a more severe issue. In detail, after running the two other tests, we got an output ID 13 for the federated left indexing. The scalar literal was also 13 which lead to incorrect replacements when preparing the individual instructions sent to the workers. By rearranging the order to input/output replacements, we now generally prevent such problems.

Switch to the first implementation approach. The refactor makes the code more maintainable, because of less indentation and implementation in the corresponding `FEDInstruction`. The static methods perform checks for both `CPInstruction` and `SPInstruction`, which will necessarily have large overlaps. A constructor with the `SPInstruction` as input (like the ones I already added with `CPInstruction`) will be added where necessary.\r\n2. Add a method to most `SPInstruction`s to convert it to a `CPInstruction`. This will be used to allow the federated worker to choose which execution type he wants to use. Most `SPInstruction` can be converted to `CPInstruction` (and vice versa) by changing the execution type in the instruction string before parsing, those we could simply tag with an interface. This would reduce code quite a bit, but is harder to maintain. Opinions are appreciated.\r\n3. Some `SPInstruction`s like `ReblockSPInstruction` don't have an equivalent `CPInstruction`, those will be sent to the worker as is. A problem arises when the federated worker opts to use the `CPInstruction` for inputs instead, this would require us to ignore the `SPInstruction`. Not sure if checking for RDD handles on the inputs is enough(?).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/1150238963/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/1150390257","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/1628#issuecomment-1150390257","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1628","id":1150390257,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArxUbc5EkY_x","user":{"login":"mboehm7","id":13721609,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzIxNjA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13721609?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7","html_url":"https://github.com/mboehm7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-08T20:39:21Z","updated_at":"2022-06-08T20:39:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for getting started on this issue @kev-inn. Unfortunately, I think the PR goes a bit in the wrong direction. We first want to do a basic cleanup of the federated instructions, without modifying the CP or Spark instructions. The replace in `FEDInstructionUtils` should stay mostly as it is, and all federated instructions should have overloaded `parseInstruction` methods to consume either CP or Spark instructions (objects) directly and construct the FED instruction like [1] without replicating the string parsing logic.
