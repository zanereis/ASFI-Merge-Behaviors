A couple of things maybe I should have pointed out: \n\na. The strategy here is not to use the container collection \"fetching\" to enforce the proper concurrency. Instead the monitor is on the contained object shuffleId.\nb.  To ensure that changes to \"fetching\" itself do not cause deadlock/race conditions, the fetching itself was changed to a ConcurrentSkipList. \n\n> > In addition, using the monitor of an object from outside to synchronized makes it hard to analyse the codes because the monitor of this object may be used (or used in the future) in other place and the developer may not notice somebody has already used it here.\n\nThis has been addressed in my latest fix. There is no place that the intern'ed monitor is not used within the synchronized block.\n\n> > The read/write operation of fetching should use the same monitor according to the java memory model. Here for different shuffleId, you use different monitor. That's wrong.\n> > This is not true after the latest fix - as described above in my (a), (b).\n\nThanks again for your help in reviewing this proposed improvement.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50170143/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50172028","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1585#issuecomment-50172028","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1585","id":50172028,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMTcyMDI4","user":{"login":"yhuai","id":2072857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzI4NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2072857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai","html_url":"https://github.com/yhuai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-25T16:23:53Z","updated_at":"2014-07-25T16:23:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"test this please\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50172028/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50172604","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1585#issuecomment-50172604","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1585","id":50172604,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMTcyNjA0","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-25T16:28:31Z","updated_at":"2014-07-25T16:28:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA tests have started for PR 1585.

I also looked in detail through the fields in TaskMetrics for races that we could face with them.  One small issue is that the metrics might be shipped off before shuffleReadBytes is updated, but after shuffleFetchWaitTime is updated, so the wait time would be slightly inaccurate with the number of bytes it represented.  My opinion is that this is ok.\n\nLet me know what you think.  If you'd still rather go a PartialTaskMetrics approach, would you consider moving that to a followup patch?

Hadoop's RecordReaders actually reuse the same object as you read data, so if you want to hold onto multiple data items, you need to clone each one. This may be a fair bit of trouble unfortunately.\n\nThat should explain it. I recall having to do a similar clone to fix reading BytesWritable in this patch.\n\nThere's an additional wrinkle to allowing users to set batch size (which I previously raised in #755). Currently, we ignore batch size when checking if 2 serializers are equal and when they are considered equal, re-serialization is a no-op. If we expose batch size to users, we have to honor it. In that case, do we still want to keep current behavior of `union`, where it doesn't proactively re-serialize if 2 rdd's serializers differ only in batch size? Adding to the confusion is current default batch size set in the SparkContext is 1000, which differs from the 10 that we pick for `saveAsPickleFile` and `SchemaRDD.javaToPython`. I don't know the reason why 1000 was chosen for SparkContext. Was it for spark's own objects, not user objects? Would a single default batch size work for both cases? As long as we can get a consensus on these, I'm happy to sort things out either in this patch or a follow-up.  \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50183228/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50183771","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1559#issuecomment-50183771","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1559","id":50183771,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMTgzNzcx","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-25T18:03:38Z","updated_at":"2014-07-25T18:03:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA tests have started for PR 1559.

Larger batch sizes help to amortize certain costs associating with pickling / depickling and in storing pickled objects in byte arrays.  If the batch size is too large, the Python worker may run out of memory while trying to serialize or deserialize too much data at once.\n\nA batch size of _n_ means that we emit a new batch every _n_ items, but this doesn't guarantee that every batch will contain exactly _n_ items (for example, if the last (or only) batch might contain fewer than _n_ items).  As a result, the batch deserializer doesn't make any assumptions about how many items appear in a batch, so it's safe to union two batched datasets as long as they have the same underlying serializer
