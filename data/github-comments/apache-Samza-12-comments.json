Please correct me if I'm wrong.\r\n\r\n1. Even kafka-topic creation shell-command supports a configuration like `replication.factor` when creating the topic(( kafka-streams supports configuration like replication.factor)). Is the change entails in the way how  kafka-client accepts this config(replication.factor) when creating the streams?\r\n2. If kafka-client API does not support `replication.factor`, wouldn't it apply to other internal metadata-topics managed by samza viz `coordinator-stream`, `checkpoint` etc? Do we need to also change the way we create these internal metadata-topics.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/472046147/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/472144603","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/samza/pull/948#issuecomment-472144603","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/948","id":472144603,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MjE0NDYwMw==","user":{"login":"dxichen","id":29577458,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NTc3NDU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29577458?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dxichen","html_url":"https://github.com/dxichen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dxichen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dxichen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dxichen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dxichen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dxichen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dxichen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dxichen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dxichen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dxichen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-12T19:19:20Z","updated_at":"2019-03-12T19:19:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"LGTM,
