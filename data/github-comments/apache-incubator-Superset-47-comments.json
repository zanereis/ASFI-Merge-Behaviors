I don't have a deeper understanding of this, but I skip this line for the bullet chart now.\r\n\r\n> > Would be nice to provide a way to set the ranges/markers from metrics as well.\r\n\r\nBy this I mean maybe you have two metrics, `SALES` and `SALES_TARGET`. Then you might want to display `SALES` as the progress bar, but put a triangle marker at `SALES_TARGET` instead of a constant. In my current version you can only specify constants.\r\n\r\nOne easy solution would be to treat non-numeric values in the `markers`/`marker_lines`/`ranges` parameters as metric names. (Maybe also for the labels.) I think I could implement this, but I see no precedent for it. Metrics are always picked from dropdowns, while here the user would have to type the metric name.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? I guess it would not actively _hurt_ anyone, so I would be inclined to implement this. Of course if you have a better idea, that would be best.\r\n\r\n> > The bullet chart is stretched to fill the height of the panel. It looks pretty bad until you resize the panel.\r\n\r\nFixed. Its height is limited to 50px now.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/265486001/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/265508886","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/366#issuecomment-265508886","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/366","id":265508886,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NTUwODg4Ng==","user":{"login":"gregroberts","id":5047021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDcwMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5047021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregroberts","html_url":"https://github.com/gregroberts","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregroberts/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregroberts/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregroberts/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregroberts/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregroberts/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregroberts/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregroberts/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregroberts/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregroberts/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-07T17:12:34Z","updated_at":"2016-12-07T17:12:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I've been looking into what permissions would be neccesary for the 'public' role to provide access to view dashboards. \r\n\r\nSo far, the permissions set:\r\n\r\n \t[can show on DashboardModelView, can show on DashboardModelViewAsync, can dashboard on Caravel, can list on DashboardModelView, can list on DashboardModelViewAsync, can edit on DashboardModelViewAsync, can welcome on Caravel]\r\n\r\nSolves the TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS error when logging in as a public user, and displays only a dashboard list page.
