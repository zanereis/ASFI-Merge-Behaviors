The problem today is even if we get the new table location in alluxio the metadata files and manifest files will be pointing to the writing FS an not use the relative path from alluxio to get the files via alluxio and leverage the cache. Instead the files will be read from the FS ignoring alluxio, only using it to get the 1st metadata file.\r\n\r\nDoes this makes a case for the relative path for manifests and metadata files?\r\n\r\nOr do you think there is another way to achieve such architecture?
