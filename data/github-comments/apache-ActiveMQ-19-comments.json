I think we _want_ to block the send call for now if we are just going to handle one at a time and essentially treat it like sync. As far as I know there is nothing that says the sender can't block and wait for the other thread to complete and it's much, much simpler. You could simply submit a task to execute the callback and wait for the future before continuing.\r\n\r\nBesides that, I don't see a benefit of the design to try and have a background thread that waits because:\r\n\r\n1. It very much increases complexity. I only briefly looked at the PR but the amount of extra handling involving count down latches and things is going to make this very hard to not have a ton of bugs.\r\n2. You are not going to gain any performance. You have to wait for each message to process one at a time anyways if you are waiting for the callback handler.\r\n3. If you are not blocking the sending thread and you keep letting the sender send more messages how are you queueing that up and applying backpressure?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/comments/2548368213/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/comments/2548536122","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/activemq/pull/1364#issuecomment-2548536122","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/1364","id":2548536122,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmM86X55M6","user":{"login":"jbonofre","id":158903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODkwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/158903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre","html_url":"https://github.com/jbonofre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-12-17T13:59:38Z","updated_at":"2024-12-17T13:59:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@kenliao94 as I don't want you get frustrating about a lot of back and forth on this PR, I would propose to take a little step back.

All these classes would benefit from modernization -- try-with-resources, etc. There are several groups of these used activemq-client/hawtbuf, etc that are all candidates for a simplified activemq-model module (in 7.x) that covers data-related models and structures.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/comments/2551603429/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/comments/2551623361","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/activemq/pull/1209#issuecomment-2551623361","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/1209","id":2551623361,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmM86YFq7B","user":{"login":"cshannon","id":123009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzAwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon","html_url":"https://github.com/cshannon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-12-18T15:30:17Z","updated_at":"2024-12-18T15:30:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I don't think that there's any problem having different versions, we have a ton of dependencies, there's no reason we need to have the same version match.\r\n\r\nIt's also not a huge deal to go through the release process.

I only sent this Google doc to you two and @mattrpav here and over email, because JB hasn't posted his receiveBody design doc yet (to serve as a reference for the new process). But Since we are halfway through this PR review I decided to use a Google doc to capture the discussion between us and get some buy in among us first. I will definitely backport it to a MD file once the Git repo for the design doc is created.\r\n\r\nAlso, Google Doc has a handy feature of converting it to MD. If you highlight the entire doc or just part of the doc, right click and select \"copy as markdown\" it will generate the Markdown file in no time. So my personal workflow has always been starting with a Google Doc and convert to whatever format the reviewers require.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9967d597-736e-4d12-820d-1a4d5daf816e)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/comments/2575988663/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/comments/2576945413","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/activemq/pull/1352#issuecomment-2576945413","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/1352","id":2576945413,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmM86ZmREF","user":{"login":"kenliao94","id":6269022,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNjkwMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6269022?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kenliao94","html_url":"https://github.com/kenliao94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kenliao94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kenliao94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kenliao94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kenliao94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kenliao94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kenliao94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kenliao94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kenliao94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kenliao94/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-08T07:39:52Z","updated_at":"2025-01-08T07:40:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hey @mattrpav @cshannon and @jbonofre  what do you think about this PR?

Toggling JMX on and off is actually the very lightweight part of this PR. To be honest I have introduced it because I wanted to keep a similar behaviour to what pre-existed. But I would personally remove it completely given, a) JMX is such a pain in most docker environments and really not well suited to NAT networks in general and b) the authentication as it is set right now simply doesn't work: even if user and password are set one can still login anonymously as soon as the `createConnector` param is set t io true (btw, the doc seems to mention the jmx authenticated access should be set up using java OPTS and with the `ManagementContext` turned off but I could not get it to work). And c) I remember reading theere's a jolokia endpoint available somewhere that would deliver just the same data in a more friendly fashion. But I decided I would not make this kind more disruptive approach.\r\n\r\n2.
