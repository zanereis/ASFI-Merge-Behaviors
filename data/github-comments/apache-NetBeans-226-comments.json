Email is fixed in PR\r\n2. the collapse-all action already exists and should be called instead of rolling a new implementation if possible.\r\nYes, if you mean this https://github.com/apache/netbeans/blob/45696ba6af2d663818daf33c49c3b2710e8d35e1/ide/projectui/src/org/netbeans/modules/project/ui/ProjectTab.java#L873 I am actually using it. I mean this action had a method inside ```private void collapseNodes(Node node, ProjectTab tab)``` and I am actually calling same method from the icon. So they actually call the same method. The only difference is that when you click on icon instead of dispatching an action via framework it is simply a method call because all needed code is already in the same file. It sounds reasonable for me. Anyway there is no code duplication for in this case.\r\n4. In the updated PR I've added code to show these icons only when mouse is in \"Projects\" or \"Files\" tab as was suggested by @Chris2011 After you remove mouse - icons are hidden.\r\n5. As for the way to to how display such icons there are 3 options. All of them are used one of the popular IDEs. Please check screenshots below. The options are:\r\n   1. Suggested implementation in this PR where buttons overlap tree and are located in the top right corner of the view. Main advantage - you don't loose vertical space. Most modern screens have 16:10 or 16:9 aspect ratio. Which if far from ideal for development. So vertical space is more valuable than horizontal. That is why I am proposing this approach. Disadvantage - you can put less icons there. But is this really a disadvantage? Netbeans has global toolbar with common icons like new file, new folder, run, debut, search, etc. You don't really need to repeat these icons in other toolbar inside of \"Projects\" view. Please check how this looks on my laptop with 15 inches screen on the last screenshot in this comment. With current implementation you can easily put few more icons.\r\n   3. Toolbar - allows you to put more icons but takes vertical space. From my personal point of view with proposed implementation we can put enough icons and save vertical space. See below how toolbar looks in Eclipse.\r\n   4. Place them in tab area as was suggested by @Chris2011 in one of the comments. This is how it is implemented in Idea. But the reason why they can do this in Idea because they don't really have tabs in \"tab area\". Instead they have drop down to switch between views. In Netbeans we simply do not have real estate to put these icons into \"tab area\". But the biggest problem with such approach is that I am afraid it will be to complex. Definitely for my first ever Netbeans PR. So I am afraid two other approaches are much more practical from the efforts stand point. At lest for me at this point.\r\n\r\nSo yes, I am really trying to convince you to green light current approach because of the reasons listed above. \r\n  \r\nScreenshots of different implementation in different IDEs:\r\nEclipse with toolbar\r\n![eclipse](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b24f76f1-93a5-4eee-aa6f-5b07670b1f07)\r\nVS Code - very similar to this approach. Icons are visible only when you have mouse in the tree view. Has more icons but there is no global toolbar in VS Code\r\n![vscode](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b6e1a693-b0ae-4dd8-80a0-058da36a1931)\r\nIdea - icons are in the tab are. But Idea does not have tabs. That is why it has more space in the \"tab area\" which allows to put icons there.\r\n![idea](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/166cd3ab-c5a5-4767-a5de-841ac570912d)\r\n\r\nHow current PR looks on my 16 inches laptop screen:\r\n![laptop-screen](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a388c967-2d5f-49fa-9dcd-e0d1b7ce9352)\r\n.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2453225025/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2453328140","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/7888#issuecomment-2453328140","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/7888","id":2453328140,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6SOtEM","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-03T07:32:08Z","updated_at":"2024-11-03T07:32:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Lets reopen until the fix is merged to master.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2453328140/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2453447457","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/7892#issuecomment-2453447457","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/7892","id":2453447457,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6SPKMh","user":{"login":"wumpz","id":1569337,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjkzMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1569337?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wumpz","html_url":"https://github.com/wumpz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wumpz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wumpz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wumpz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wumpz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wumpz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wumpz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wumpz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wumpz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wumpz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-03T14:28:13Z","updated_at":"2024-11-03T14:28:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"So thx for the help.

And minimize is not \"view specific\" I mean it is not related to any particular view like \"Services\" or \"Projects\" but to window management as a whole and applies to all windows. If there are any examples when some view puts a custom button in a tab area please point me to this example. I'd like to check the code to understand how this can be done. Since at the moment with my very limited knowledge of Netbeans codebase I simply do not know how to do this and if this is even possible at all. When I work in with ide/projectui/src/org/netbeans/modules/project/ui/ProjectTab.java - I do not have access to the tab are. And the view can be even detached. That is why I am afraid that this may be not possible at all. Since actual view probably does not even know if it is opened as a tab or is it detached. If there are examples where this is already implemented - please help me to locate them to check the code.\r\n\r\n@mbien For me, implementation of toolbar or current approach seem much easier from the coding perspective.

Possibly switching to JSVG (or build time generation) for icons in the core platform doesn't necessarily mean we don't keep Batik around as an autoload library elsewhere in the IDE for other purposes.  In line with that, I would look at adding the additional Batik libraries required for this separately in the ide cluster rather than platform cluster.  The size of Batik already caused enough of a concern in #1278 - let's not add to that.\r\n\r\nAs and when anyone does make the icon loading use something else, all of the Batik libraries (along with a couple of dependencies that were previously moved), could move to the ide cluster?\r\n\r\nI like the general idea of providing this support in the IDE incidentally.\r\n\r\ncc/ @eirikbakke ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2459186243/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2459437816","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/7938#issuecomment-2459437816","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/7938","id":2459437816,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6SmAr4","user":{"login":"Chris2011","id":795658,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NTY1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/795658?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011","html_url":"https://github.com/Chris2011","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-06T10:58:14Z","updated_at":"2024-11-06T10:58:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@neilcsmith-net thx for the info.

I am trying to understand if it makes sense to  continue with \"Favorites\" view or not.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2462673979/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2462701758","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/7925#issuecomment-2462701758","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/7925","id":2462701758,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6Sydi-","user":{"login":"Chris2011","id":795658,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NTY1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/795658?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011","html_url":"https://github.com/Chris2011","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-07T16:37:29Z","updated_at":"2024-11-07T16:37:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"There are different opinions and most of the concerns are valid. It adds new features to the IDE and also to the platform which has impact of the UI too. Do all developers/users of NetBeans understands the different concepts of toolbar buttons/settings and quick actions? Does it fits in the UI or do we change the whole UI for this to fit in the tab area for example? I know that those discussions are frustrating. And also we need maybe an option for your new feature that people can say \"I don't want this fancy buttons\" as we often have this.

OTOH, your proposal looks better!\r\n\r\nThe blocker for me is the action registration.

I am still learning how this all works. Some actions already exist.\r\nWhen you right click on the tab header of code editor there is \"Select in Projects\". Which means that this action already exists. But the \"problem\" is that it always opens this file in \"Projects\" view. While I am adding these icons to multiple view - right now it is already \"Projects\" and \"Files\". When I click the icon in \"Files\" view I can't use \"Select in Projects\" because it will open other view. I need something like \"Select in Files\". But \"files\" and \"projects\" views are not 2 different classes - they are implemented by the same class. So I still need to figure out how to call different actions from the same code depending on what view is used. At the moment I am not sure how I can know which view \"projects\" or \"files\" has focus now. For \"Favorites\" I need yet another action \"Select in Favorites\".\r\n\r\nFor collapse all icon for \"Files\" and \"Projects\" there is already registered action. There is no need to register new one. I am not calling this functionality via \"action\" because this action is in the same file as my other code. So I simply can call same method which is used by action. So, in this case there is no code duplication, corresponding action already exists and I use the same method which is used by this action.\r\n\r\nYes sure I can spend time on looking more into how actions work and try to find where \"Favorites\" view is implemented and change it as well. If you know file name please share. However this PR already has a lot of comments and some of the question whether this feets Netbeans or not. I am asking for decision to know what to do next. You already see UI and screenshots from other IDEs. And if this PR will not be accepted there is no need for me to spend time on trying to work on actions and \"Favorites\". I absolutely respect what you do and you have complete right accept something or not. I am asking to know if it makes sense for me to continue or not.

You need to load the actions via a layer folder, and attach them to your buttons.  The folder contains shadows (symlinks) to the actions - you are not registering a new action, but you are referencing it from somewhere else.\r\n\r\nIt looks like the collapse all action relies on a String in the view root node Lookup - https://github.com/apache/netbeans/blob/master/ide/projectui/src/org/netbeans/modules/project/ui/ProjectsRootNode.java#L116  Seems odd to use a String.

It is stupid to carry an SVG rendering library (be it Batik or JSVG) and not integrate it to render SVG. Having rendering identical to browser will be hard, as it seems, SVG goes the same way as HTML (i.e. chaotic support and development), so a library not aiming for perfection, but pragmatic rendering might even be the best option.\r\n\r\nThe rendering issue of images can be explained as this\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\">\r\n    <image href=\"icons/vue.png\" x=\"10\" y=\"10\" height=\"180px\" width=\"280px\"/>\r\n</svg>\r\n```\r\n\r\nis neither SVG 1.1 nor 1.2.

In fact inkscape writes that by default.\r\n\r\nFor the preview I think being able to scale would be good, as implemented in the `ide/image` module (Screenshot shows example image with toolbar):\r\n\r\n![grafik](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ceba4077-1a7a-454d-8af3-8a6215551108)\r\n\r\nIn that module there is also an `ImageNavigatorPanel` and `ImagePreviewPanel` that could be an inspiration for SVG support.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure, that I see the SVG support inside the XML module, it could also be in image or independent.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2463038766/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2463153740","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/7925#issuecomment-2463153740","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/7925","id":2463153740,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6S0L5M","user":{"login":"Chris2011","id":795658,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NTY1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/795658?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011","html_url":"https://github.com/Chris2011","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-07T20:29:40Z","updated_at":"2024-11-07T20:29:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@s4gh it always make sense to have a look into everything what you want to change and add etc. doesn't matter one or two PRs doesn't get accepted or to much comments, etc. So please don't get this wrong.
