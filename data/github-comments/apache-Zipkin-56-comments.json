I suspect java\nconfig will be less indirect for the storage component, and also reduce\nconfusion when binding to property based configuration in spring. Can we\nuse java config to supply defaults instead of XML?\n * I'd advise against doing merge logic on consumption (implying\nread-backs). Typically we merge at query time, and in doing so\nfunctionality such as \"raw trace\" (what instrumentation sent) is retained.\nThis also allows certain things like timestamps to remain authoritative vs\nguessing.\n * On timestamps, I'd suggest adding things with an ingest timestamp if one\nis missing from the span (but leaving the span in-tact).

If you want a special server to make testing easier in the short term, you could consider making something similar to stackdriver-zipkin. Otherwise, you can do a pure library integration like done in zipkin-aws or zipkin-azure.\r\n\r\nThis repo should be in your account or org; in github it is easy to move repos when the time comes to consider such.

This seems like a bug unless they are supposed to be calling themselves? They are also missing http tags, which are placed on their parents. more on that below:\r\nspan fe70d9705ea17279 f5f9dcc8edb20ae7: these look a bit distracting as they have http tags (binary annotations), yet are marked local.

Just to let you know where we're currently at. \r\n\r\n- We started working on a C++ implementation here to get our feet under us: https://github.com/rnburn/zipkin-cpp-opentracing. It's based on the implementation in Envoy for the pragmatic reason that it was easier, and allowed us to start by refactoring the code running in the system we are committed to maintaining in production (envoy). We haven't heard from @flier  yet, though they did respond to our PRs which was nice. Maybe they haven't seen this issue?\r\n\r\n- I agree your suggestion of keeping the OT-zipkin bridge separate from the zipkin API, so we are taking that approach. Both pieces still are in the same repo for the time being.\r\n\r\n- OT C++11 API is ready for review. It would be great if someone from zipkin with C++ experience could review it (I'll mention in gitter as well): https://github.com/opentracing/opentracing-cpp/pull/11\r\n\r\n- We can move our work into OpenZipkin if there are no objections, and we are happy to collaborate with @flier and others on API design, combining concepts and code in from both repos. We are focused more on making zipkin work in the context of OT, and have few opinions about what the ZipKin C++ API should look like beyond that, so we don't really want to go much farther without more involvement from the rest of the ZipKin community.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nTed","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/315470789/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/315499002","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1643#issuecomment-315499002","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1643","id":315499002,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNTQ5OTAwMg==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-15T01:06:00Z","updated_at":"2017-07-15T01:06:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi, ted.\n\nThanks for the updates.

Splitting existing Span into SimpleSpan is very complex due to many things including:\r\n* looseness of Endpoint type (which permits null eventhough it isn't really permitted)\r\n* Endpoint instances sometimes mismatch in the same process (one has port one doesn't)\r\n* Sometimes by mistake people end up with more than 2 hosts in one span.\r\n\r\n\"simplespan native\" storage (ex elasticsearch w/o nested queries) depends on us being able to split old spans into simplified ones, so the impact of this complexity is delay on this milestone. We can't reasonably expect to have sites with only \"simplespan\" reporter/collectors, so this is a reality vs a nice to have.\r\n\r\nTL;DR; more effort to get through this, hopefully another day or two.

.net topic is a pretty important one. There have been several occurrences where someone has entered the gitter channel asking about .net tracing and we are stuck between a rock and a hard place: Mention the incomplete zipkin-csharp project or mention one of the two full featured second-party projects such as criteo and mdsol's. Unless I hear strong objections from folks in @openzipkin/core, we'll move forward with setting aside zipkin-csharp in favor of what's currently criteo/zipkin4net\r\n\r\n### On stopping the zipkin-csharp experiment\r\n\r\nI've initiated an effort to move zipkin-csharp either to the attic or under @aliostad's personal account. You can follow that there, but suffice to say it is stalled and not healthy compared to other options. I'm asking folks to comment on this issue if you have strong feelings about zipkin-csharp: https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-csharp/issues/36\r\n\r\n### On Criteo's tracer going into OpenZipkin\r\n\r\nOn moving forward, I've informally asked @openzipkin/core about .net or at least csharp. There's unsurprisingly still support to have a full-featured tracer available in the OpenZipkin repository. While great work exists both in MdSol and Criteo repositories, Criteo have extra resources available to carry forward a transition. \r\n\r\n### Why Criteo?\r\n\r\nCode aside, I've paid attention to folks at criteo. Like MdSol, Criteo actively participate in distributed tracing workshop and tough problems here in Zipkin. @fedj takes time to address requests made by others or those that make it fit well with projects like zipkin-js. He's also one of the few people who volunteered to help do Zipkin builds, and has fixed bugs on the server. Their site is one of the [highest volume sites Zipkin has](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eNYz1ATpDkmh3oyuRKcX7sYtFTAZGZuWAJy7VijjXyI/edit), so keeping things working is of mutual benefit. Finally, it is more than reasonable to have a tracer written by one of our core team members be the official one. Knowing our other core teammates MdSol are supportive of this is equally important.\r\n\r\n### But what about fsharp etc?\r\n\r\nIf we are honest, it is not the right time to hold back a healthy csharp option in favor of one that doesn't exist. There is no project that covers all languages in dotnet, but if that happens, we can revisit it. It is encouraging that Criteo have taken time to address things they may not need themselves, such as .Net Standard 1.5 compat.\r\n\r\n### But what about OpenTracing?\r\n\r\n@fedj has also raised work towards a bridge for those who want to use opentracing. That's currently a pull request, but could be pulled out as a separate repo to address version drift if needed https://github.com/criteo/zipkin4net/pull/74\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/316579339/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/316592467","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1243#issuecomment-316592467","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1243","id":316592467,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNjU5MjQ2Nw==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-20T04:20:08Z","updated_at":"2017-07-20T04:20:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"closing

But of course, the primitives are pretty small and implementing them all is not an issue warranting a dedicated project mainly because everyone has moved on now and built their own. So Criteo project is one that shines since it has all that and more.\r\n\r\nBut there are problems, not of taste and implementation strategy but actual practicality:\r\n\r\nAs the name implies, the package is `Criteo.Profiling.Tracing` - and not even mention of zipkin. It is very specific to how Criteo does things. They are on the new world of .NET (core and .net standards) which include only a very small percentage of .NET ecosystem - my guess is less than 2%. The builds are all purely `bash`, no `bat` or powershell, which I guess are run on mac or linux unless you want to yse Windows 10's bash for windows (which comes with no warranty). This probably covers 5% of people's work machines - frankly many devs will panic seeing a file having `.sh` extension.\r\n\r\nI work for a company which is one of the top (if not toppest) Azure consumers on this side of Atlantic, with 40 development teams. And it is ahead in many respect to the rest of the \"Dark Matter\" Enterprise. But Criteo is just at the bleeding edge, and they do not seem to make an effort to cover anyone else (and nothing wrong with that as the name of the project implies). I personally cannot use any of the stuff, at work I am running Windows 7 along with the rest of the company (and I use my personal Mac for ssh, etc) and we are only trialing .NET Core in one of our 40 dev teams.\r\n\r\nThere is not even a .NET 4.5-4.6 package of the library on nuget - it is all new world. Yes, you can run using the new world's backward compatibility but that is just not something we can do at this point. So if for me this is not usable, you can guess what it is for all those \"Dark Matter\" developers out there.\r\n\r\nAs such, my guess is we still need another project:\r\n\r\n - Builds the primitives in all supported .NET frameworks (4.5.2 and plus)\r\n - Has multi-target build which targets .NET Standard\r\n - Zipkin is the first class citizen. Logging/Monitoring/Alerting is a big domain and it needs to be just about the Zipkin side of it.\r\n\r\nSo here are my 2 cents. Frankly I wish I could just use Criteo packages but I cannot, so I have to build it from scratch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/316703370/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/316710378","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1480#issuecomment-316710378","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1480","id":316710378,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNjcxMDM3OA==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-20T13:54:12Z","updated_at":"2017-07-20T13:54:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"added https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/1656 to fix dependency linking.

We did setup a bash script for travis, and would be happy to accept a powershell script PR if you find it helpful.\r\n\r\nWe compile both .Net standard and v4.5 but haven't published nuget v4.5 yet. As a part of publishing openzipkin packages, we'll start with .Net standard and if users ask for it, certainly can find a solution for 4.5\r\n\r\nWe hope that in moving to openzipkin, folks can share what they need in the issues list or even as a pull request. Either way is far better than guessing.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/316724857/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/316815083","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1655#issuecomment-316815083","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1655","id":316815083,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNjgxNTA4Mw==","user":{"login":"shakuzen","id":8924140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MjQxNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8924140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shakuzen","html_url":"https://github.com/shakuzen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shakuzen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shakuzen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shakuzen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shakuzen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shakuzen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shakuzen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shakuzen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shakuzen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shakuzen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-20T20:06:21Z","updated_at":"2017-07-20T20:06:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@sri420 Also note that the in-memory storage is only really meant to be used when doing local testing or proof of concept demos.

I'd like to consider reverting to span.timestamp/duration just like the existing one does.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can research, the idea of changing span.timestamp/duration as we have now to span.startTimestamp/finishTimestamp came from me. When working on brave v4 one of things I ran into was that when recording, it is sometimes better to have two timestamps instead of one and a duration.\r\n* from an api pov, all numeric values are timestamps (so accidentally putting duration where timestamp should go is impossible)\r\n* from a data pov, you could receive partial information, like start/end in different patches (as done in async span)\r\n\r\nWhat I didn't think about was that we have a duration query. If we choose to store two timestamps instead of a single timestamp and a duration (as we do now), then the duration query is more effortful. For example, you need to sneak a field or make a custom index from date math.\r\n\r\nSo, in hindsight, even if folks support a two timestamp (start/finish) approach for the api, it might be better to report a duration field like we do now. This makes duration query dead simple in document stores like Elasticsearch, and from a code POV subtracting timestamps before writing json is easy. Moreover, the two-host async span sharing a single span ID thing will eventually go away anyway.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/316925849/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/316926325","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/1651#issuecomment-316926325","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1651","id":316926325,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNjkyNjMyNQ==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-21T07:26:52Z","updated_at":"2017-07-21T07:26:52Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"all tests are good with local span store.\r\n\r\nI moved onto @openzipkin/elasticsearch, but ran into a glitch and need feedback on the idea or reverting to span.timestamp/duration (so that duration query is effortless) https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1499#issuecomment-316925849","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/316926325/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/316936677","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1499#issuecomment-316936677","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1499","id":316936677,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNjkzNjY3Nw==","user":{"login":"anuraaga","id":198344,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5ODM0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/198344?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga","html_url":"https://github.com/anuraaga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-21T08:17:15Z","updated_at":"2017-07-21T08:17:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Agree that duration queries across documents without a preprocessing step would be very difficult.
