In fact, since we can't prevent them from using the Future APIs, and since they might not know the configuration exists, they're likely to use the Future APIs anyway.\r\n\r\nIf users don't understand the need for a separate callback executor, and we want to take the responsibility for telling them, configuration reference would be the wrong place to do so - we should document this in the API javadocs (i.e., close to when the need to understand this) instead. \r\n\r\nAnother way to think about this: Even if we assume users always read all configurations, to make the configuration useful you'd have to describe when to use it and what to set it to.

With my change, `IntermediateStreamManager` cannot operate independently from the `ExecutionPlanner` since it relies on it for traversing the operator graph and grouping conjoined edges.\r\n\r\n2. If we have plans to use `IntermediateStreamManager` independently, then our only alternative would be to have it perform the traversal/grouping work currently done in the `ExecutionPlanner` redundantly. In addition to the computational overhead, this would entail promoting the stream grouping class, `StreamSet`, into a package-level class — an option I would not prefer because this class has no way of maintaining its invariant, i.e. the correct categorization of a group of streams, e.g. all vs some vs no partitions set, since `StreamEdge`s are mutable.\r\n\r\n3. I also dislike the idea of having `calculatePartitions()` expect both a `JobGraph` _and_ a list of conjoined stream edges since there seems to be quite a bit of overlap between the two. On the other hand, I wouldn't want to reconstruct these groups in the `IntermediateStreamManager` redundantly, unless it could be used independently from the `ExecutionPlanner`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/425535858/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/425540295","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/samza/pull/674#issuecomment-425540295","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/674","id":425540295,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNTU0MDI5NQ==","user":{"login":"bharathkk","id":1001798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDE3OTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1001798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharathkk","html_url":"https://github.com/bharathkk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharathkk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharathkk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharathkk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharathkk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharathkk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharathkk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharathkk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharathkk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharathkk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-28T19:22:26Z","updated_at":"2018-09-28T19:22:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@vjagadish @weisong44 please take a look","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/425540295/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
