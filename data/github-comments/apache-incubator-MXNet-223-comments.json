I hadn't written my own iterator. I had thought that model->fit() would somehow be able to take multiple iterators, say, one for each corresponding input. I guess that is not the case...model->fit() expect a single iterator for all inputs, correct? \r\n\r\nAlso, one final question, I believe the data types to be specified are the numpy data types, correct? That is, float32, int64, and so forth (https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/basics.types.html). My questions is, how do I specify that one of the inputs is a one-hot encoding of some categorical values? Suppose for example the variable holds city names of which there can be only 9 potential values. How do I specify that data type in the custom iterator? Or do I? How does one handle one hot encodings with the Perl API?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/323149062/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/323156492","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/7506#issuecomment-323156492","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/7506","id":323156492,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMzE1NjQ5Mg==","user":{"login":"ptrendx","id":8398980,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzOTg5ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8398980?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx","html_url":"https://github.com/ptrendx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-17T18:31:03Z","updated_at":"2017-08-17T18:31:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Is it CUDA build?
