These errors would reflect a failure to save the query on the backend, and could result in lost data, so we should let the user know that.\r\n\r\nThanks, I worked on the error messages making them actionable. Granted, most of them simply say \"please contact your administrator\", but there's not much the user can do except for trying saving the query.\r\n\r\n> Also, it looks like if the sync to the backend fails, then we don't perform the action on the client side, and that we also synchronously wait for the backend sync to finish before making the client side change. Maybe instead we should be optimistically updating the UI immediately and then firing off the request (and reverting the UI back if the query fails). Not sure how much latency this adds in actuality.\r\n\r\nIn my tests there was no perceived latency, since the payload and the response are both usually very small. I think it might be more confusing to adjust the UI optimistically and revert it when the sync fails.\r\n\r\n> As a side note, should we expose a button to the user to manually save the query if they see the error message? I worry that people will freak out about losing data once they see this new update.\r\n\r\nI added a message telling them to click \"Save Query\" when an error happens. I don't think we do a good job in letting users know that they should explicitly save the queries they care about, and this was discussed last week during the design brainstorm with Cartel. I think later we'll rethink the way query organization work, and we can iterate on this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/530062997/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/530112283","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/8173#issuecomment-530112283","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/8173","id":530112283,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMDExMjI4Mw==","user":{"login":"kristw","id":1659771,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTk3NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1659771?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw","html_url":"https://github.com/kristw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-10T20:46:41Z","updated_at":"2019-09-10T20:46:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@etr2460 Addressed your comments","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/530112283/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/530120105","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/7865#issuecomment-530120105","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/7865","id":530120105,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMDEyMDEwNQ==","user":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-10T21:07:24Z","updated_at":"2019-09-10T21:07:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had recent activity.

However, it seems to be unnecessarily specific to Presto, and should be fairly easy to enable for other engines, too, by moving as much of the logic as possible to `BaseEngineSpec` raising `NotImplementedError()` if not enabled (the Presto spec is getting fairly heavy lately, and there's probably other stuff that could be made more generic to benefit other engines). Probably ok to keep this in Presto for now, and I can probably work on making this accessible to other engines in a later

This is a nice feature. However, it seems to be unnecessarily specific to Presto, and should be fairly easy to enable for other engines, too, by moving as much of the logic as possible to BaseEngineSpec raising NotImplementedError() if not enabled (the Presto spec is getting fairly heavy lately, and there's probably other stuff that could be made more generic to benefit other engines). Probably ok to keep this in Presto for now, and I can probably work on making this accessible to other engines in a later PR.\r\n\r\nI agree. I think we need to start by adding an abstract method to `BaseEngineSpec` for running queries, and then it should be trivial to extend this to other engines.
