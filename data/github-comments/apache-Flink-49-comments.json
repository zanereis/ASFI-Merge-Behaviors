are hard to parallelize.\nFor distributed and gigabyte size data, an approximative approach is preferable, like the one we discuss in this article:\n\nE. Schubert, A. Zimek, H.-P. Kriegel\nFast and Scalable Outlier Detection with Approximate Nearest Neighbor Ensembles\nIn Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications (DASFAA), Hanoi, Vietnam: 19–36, 2015. \n\nWe discuss an approach that is easy to parallelize. It needs sorting and a sliding window (or blocks), so it is not strict MapReduce, but it should be a good match for Flink. The hardest part is to get the different space filling curves right and efficient. The other components (random projections to reduce dimensionality, ensemble to improve quality, and list inversions to also build reverse kNN that then allow accelerating methods such as LOF are much easier).\n\nThe main drawback of most of these kNN-join approaches (including ours) is that they only work with Minkowski norms. There are much more interesting distance functions than that...\n\nWe also discuss why the space filling curves appear to give better results for kNN, while LSH etc. work better for radius joins. LSH is another option, but it cannot guarantee to find k neighbors and parameter tuning is tricky. So you may want to have a look at this recent ensemble approach instead.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/130469648/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/130509029","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1009#issuecomment-130509029","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1009","id":130509029,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMDUwOTAyOQ==","user":{"login":"ffbin","id":13081808,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDgxODA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13081808?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffbin","html_url":"https://github.com/ffbin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffbin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffbin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffbin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffbin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffbin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffbin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffbin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffbin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffbin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-13T02:18:50Z","updated_at":"2015-08-13T02:18:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@uce @hsaputra  Thanks.

I think we should use `read()` instead of `readLine()` because we are using a custom delimiter and not necessarily \"\\n\" (newline symbol). The danger of reading an entire line is that the newline symbol might never arrive. So it might continue to read forever. And even if it manages to find a newline symbol, you have to truncate your input to find the custom delimiter. That's not very efficient. Can you change the code back to using the `read()` method? I think we had a misunderstanding.\n\nFor you test case: It's not considered good practice to mix production and test code. You're doing that by introducing the `isRetrying` flag and exposing it. Alternatively, you have two options:\n1. Create a `ServerSocket` and pass its address to the `SocketTextStreamFunction`. Then control the connection to this socket and count how often the function reconnects (e.g. use the `accept()` method).\n2. Create your test in the same package as the `SocketTextStreamFunction` function (package is `org.apache.flink.streaming.api.functions.source`). Then you can access all field variables which are protected. So make your `retries` variable a protected field variable of the `SocketTextStreamFunction` class.\n\nI hope that this helps you. If not, feel free to ask more questions.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/130588652/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/130595336","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/966#issuecomment-130595336","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/966","id":130595336,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMDU5NTMzNg==","user":{"login":"mxm","id":837221,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNzIyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/837221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm","html_url":"https://github.com/mxm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-13T09:51:19Z","updated_at":"2015-08-13T09:51:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you for your remarks @StephanEwen.\n\n> I think you should go ahead and just call them \"Rich\".

Further, it means we have to add another dependency when the same could be accomplished using akka.\nIn this implementation, the parameter _server_ is at every task manager [effectively it acts as a client to serve all running tasks at one node. In fact, in this sense, there are no servers, just clients at every worker, which are managed by the Job Manager]. This in itself means lesser data transfer over the network, since every _server_ will usually be owner of a key and can serve its _clients_ faster instead of every request going over the network.\nFurther, it is completely distributed, and every task manager maintains its own _server_ and sets it up or tears it down along-with itself.\nAs far as including it in the core itself is concerned, there isn't much of it. There are the 3-4 odd functions directly added in the Runtime context, which effectively serve as an interface.\n@tillrohrmann, could you weigh in here if this is the intended use of a PS in ML algorithms. I can easily see this working with, for example, the regression algorithm.\nThe reasons I included it into the runtime is that, there will be no chances of failure now. If the TaskManager is alive, the Parameter Server at that client will be alive. Further, the Job Manager manages the servers and determines where each key will go [which will be crucial to recovery], something which can be very hard to determine in a completely de-centralized manner (I couldn't think of a full-proof way). This ensures that the server is running only on the workers where it's needed, and if it is needed. Keeping the Job Manager in the loop also ensures that recovery is easy. If a Task Manager fails, the Job Manager knows which server failed by matching the `InstanceID`s and can kick off the recovery process from the duplicate server. [This is not implemented yet.]\nA stand-alone PS will add another master-node system in parallel to the JobManager-TaskManager system, which can be efficiently used for this purpose. Of course, this doesn't matter if we use an external key-value store.\nI will have a look at #967 and see how the two can be integrated.\n\nI had a look at an open implementation done for Spark. https://github.com/apache/spark/compare/branch-1.3...chouqin:ps-on-spark-1.3\nThis adds a separate context and a function on RDD to access the PS and does require running a service inside the core environment.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/131477326/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/131493503","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1021#issuecomment-131493503","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1021","id":131493503,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMTQ5MzUwMw==","user":{"login":"Rucongzhang","id":13606366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjA2MzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13606366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rucongzhang","html_url":"https://github.com/Rucongzhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rucongzhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rucongzhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rucongzhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rucongzhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rucongzhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rucongzhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rucongzhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rucongzhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rucongzhang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-16T06:00:52Z","updated_at":"2015-08-16T06:00:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Yes,stephan  it should throw an exception.I will modify .Thank you very much!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/131493503/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/131495368","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1020#issuecomment-131495368","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1020","id":131495368,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMTQ5NTM2OA==","user":{"login":"ffbin","id":13081808,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDgxODA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13081808?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffbin","html_url":"https://github.com/ffbin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffbin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffbin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffbin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffbin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffbin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffbin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffbin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffbin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffbin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-16T06:45:37Z","updated_at":"2015-08-16T06:45:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@StephanEwen  Thanks.
