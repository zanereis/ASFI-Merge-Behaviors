, I agree to your valid points but i am thinking  data load is a frequent operation compare to Create, and more over once you create table with the column properties specified, it will remain the same throughout the table life cycle, if we give in load command there is always a scope of inconsistency by keeping few loads with trimmed data and few without.  i think user shall able to judge/decide if data should contain white spaces or it shall be trimmed for particular column if he knows his schema well .\nAnd more over if the initial load the column data is having white space and as you told above he thinks to trim it, for that again user will perform data loading, but in this case his column count/distinct count and all will be different compare to the actual  and also he has to see more query result with the data he is not interested, now if he delete the particular load also again he needs to reload the particular load data which will be again a cumbersome process. we shall try to make user to make his steps right and keep it simple.\nYou can put a view on my above
