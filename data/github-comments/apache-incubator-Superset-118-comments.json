The way that the XY Line Chart works under the hood is that it orders the result set of the query based on whichever column/metric is selected to be plotted on the X-axis. This way, the line(s) that is/are plotted will have continuity in the series. In other words, the dots are connected in the order that you expect to be connected. For the best visualization, quantitative columns/metrics should be plotted on the X or Y axis, and qualitative fields should go in the `sliceBy` part of the visualization.\r\n\r\nFor your specific use case, in my opinion, there are a few ways to go about it:\r\n* Encode your month field into a `DATETIME`-like column, mark it as temporal in the column edit view, and then plot it as a timeseries visualization with month granularity.\r\n* Plot the month integer on the X-axis, and label the X-axis as \"Month (numerical)\" or something descriptive.\r\n* Extend the X Axis Format to format numerical month-integers as string month-values.\r\n\r\nAnother solution is to allow users to specify their own ordering for the result set, but I'm not sure how useful or intuitive that would be. I'm open to suggestions here.\r\n\r\nAlso re: downloading dashboard data into a single csv/zip - As far as I know, it does not seem like it, and you'll have to export individual charts as CSV. It can be filed as a feature request though.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/361770681/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/361777851","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/4313#issuecomment-361777851","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/4313","id":361777851,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MTc3Nzg1MQ==","user":{"login":"hughhhh","id":27827808,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3ODI3ODA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27827808?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughhhh","html_url":"https://github.com/hughhhh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughhhh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughhhh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughhhh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughhhh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughhhh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughhhh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughhhh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughhhh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughhhh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-31T00:06:17Z","updated_at":"2018-01-31T00:06:17Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This is an awesome start by the way!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/361777851/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/361823885","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/4312#issuecomment-361823885","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/4312","id":361823885,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MTgyMzg4NQ==","user":{"login":"MANUVILAKUNNATHU","id":16819201,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODE5MjAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16819201?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MANUVILAKUNNATHU","html_url":"https://github.com/MANUVILAKUNNATHU","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MANUVILAKUNNATHU/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MANUVILAKUNNATHU/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MANUVILAKUNNATHU/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MANUVILAKUNNATHU/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MANUVILAKUNNATHU/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MANUVILAKUNNATHU/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MANUVILAKUNNATHU/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MANUVILAKUNNATHU/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MANUVILAKUNNATHU/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-31T04:56:30Z","updated_at":"2018-01-31T04:56:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I need to clear the query results each time a new user login. what code changes should I do for it.
