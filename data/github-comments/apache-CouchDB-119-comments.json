Thank you for the quick response @wohali .\r\n> \r\n> What was the reasoning behind changing this and only allowing admins to create new users by default?\r\n> \r\n> I also saw that there is a new setting called `users_db_security_editable`, which defaults to `false`. The docs say the following:\r\n> \r\n> > When this configuration setting is set to false, reject any attempts to modify the _users database security object. Modification of this object is deprecated in 3.x and will be completely disallowed in CouchDB 4.x.\r\n> \r\n> If I interpret this correctly, editing the `_users/_security` object will not be possible anymore in the future. Since it defaults to `admins`, this will be the only option for creating users then. Given these changes, what would you say are the best practices for creating users going forward?\r\n> \r\n> I liked CouchDB, because the http API was built-in. Since I can't hardcode admin credentials into the client, I will need a middleman API then, which acts as an admin during user creation. Is that how you intend user creation to work in the future?\r\n\r\nIs the answer that the default will be false in 4.x?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/1632247244/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/1632723398","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/4139#issuecomment-1632723398","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/4139","id":1632723398,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmUc5hUWHG","user":{"login":"janl","id":11321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl","html_url":"https://github.com/janl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-12T15:10:20Z","updated_at":"2023-07-12T15:10:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"superseded by https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/4673 — will port remaining relevant comments over","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/1632723398/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/1633913882","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/4674#issuecomment-1633913882","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/4674","id":1633913882,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmUc5hY4wa","user":{"login":"janl","id":11321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl","html_url":"https://github.com/janl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-13T09:43:34Z","updated_at":"2023-07-13T09:43:34Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> sidebar: is it appropriate to move the -include install.mk directive?

If one node is becoming full, we'd return an ` insufficient_storage` error from workers there. The request overall might even skip over that error and return a 201/202 if other shard copies reply with a success. That's a good behavior on one hand, on the other hand, there a good chance updates we blocked interactively would still make it to the affected nodes via the internal replicator and would continue filling up the disk.\r\n> \r\n> Not sure what a good solution might be. These are a few random thoughts I had:\r\n> \r\n>     1. We could crash the whole update_doc request if any shard copy is almost full? But even then, it might be too late as the successful requests on other nodes would still propagate via the internal replicator to the full node.\r\n> \r\n>     2. Is there a graceful way to stop internal replicator jobs and avoid them going into a crash loop and making a mess to avoid replicating data to nodes which are getting full?\r\n> \r\n>     3. I am wondering if at least for doc writes it would make sense to keep track of cluster wide disk usage (via a gossip between `couch_disk_monitor` gen_server or something like that) and return an immediate error at the fabric level without attempting any worker doc writes. That would increase the complexity of disk monitor, but would avoid the internal replicator loophole issue?\r\n\r\nI think I will revise the block_database_writes() to be only _interactive_ writes. replicated writes will be permitted, as anti-entropy is critical.

That endpoint can return a 400 if the request parameters cannot be executed by the index.\r\n\r\nThat idea also gives users a migration path away from the flawed choosing algorithm. A future (major) release of CouchDB might then drop `/dbname/_find` entirely.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/1660300445/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/1660310854","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/4710#issuecomment-1660310854","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/4710","id":1660310854,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmUc5i9lVG","user":{"login":"janl","id":11321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl","html_url":"https://github.com/janl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-01T13:23:39Z","updated_at":"2023-08-01T13:23:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"In general, for API migrations we loosely agreed on: introduce a better API, eventually retire the old one, maybe.\r\n\r\nIn that light, adding the REST-URL-selects-index route is adding the better API and we can later remove raw `_find` when we think the time is right.\r\n\r\nThat is indeed cleaner than adding another toggle to change the behaviour of `use_index`. \r\n\r\nI have no problems with that approach.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/1660310854/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/1660311391","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/4710#issuecomment-1660311391","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/4710","id":1660311391,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmUc5i9ldf","user":{"login":"rnewson","id":47223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson","html_url":"https://github.com/rnewson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnewson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-01T13:23:54Z","updated_at":"2023-08-01T13:23:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@janl I don't see how this is a step towards \"making the Mango-query-index-selection API look similar to JS views and search APIs\". my suggestion of adding `/path/to/specific/index/_find` does that, but expanding `/dbname/_find` does not.
