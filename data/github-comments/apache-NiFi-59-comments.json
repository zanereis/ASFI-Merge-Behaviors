I think the solution that you provided here will work for this use case, but I'm a little bit concerned with this approach. I say that because if a field has a type of ARRAY, then the object should be array, not a List. Avro, however, comes with some oddities, and so in the AvroTypeUtil class, there is a method named isCompatibleDataType(). It checks if the \"avro form\" of an object is compatible with a given data type. So I think this is where we should add this logic. Adding it to DataTypeUtils may result in a different writer expecting an array but getting a List object. If we instead just update AvroTypeUtil#isCompatibleDataType to allow for a List in the case of Arrays, then I think we will still have the desired outcome but will prevent passing List objects around generically for ARRAY data types.

All is working as expected. I've just one remark: when using users only search, but also setting the group name attribute, the full DN of the group is used.

Niels,\r\n\r\nThank you for making a submission to improve NiFi. I totally understand your concern that the logs can be busy with these messages when you have a high number of users connecting. To even need to deal with this situation means you're using NiFi in a productive manner. However, we find that this message in particular is extremely helpful in debugging for users who are not as successful in configuring and using the application. Being able to identify the attempted authentication requests without having to walk them through making substantial configuration changes allows faster and more detailed responses. \r\n\r\nHowever, I definitely empathize with your situation. Can I suggest making a local change in your `$NIFI_HOME/conf/logback.xml` file? Two possible solutions are changing the log level of the entire package to be `WARN`, as you seem to have a good handle on the application and don't need informational alerts on successful actions, or elevating the log level for that specific class while retaining `INFO` messages for the other actions in that package. \r\n\r\n## Option 1:\r\n\r\nReplace \r\n\r\n    <logger name=\"org.apache.nifi.web.security\" level=\"INFO\" additivity=\"false\">\r\n        <appender-ref ref=\"USER_FILE\"/>\r\n    </logger>\r\n\r\nwith\r\n\r\n    <logger name=\"org.apache.nifi.web.security\" level=\"WARN\" additivity=\"false\">\r\n        <appender-ref ref=\"USER_FILE\"/>\r\n    </logger>\r\n\r\n\r\n## Option 2:\r\n\r\nAdd\r\n\r\n    <logger name=\"org.apache.nifi.web.security.NiFiAuthenticationFilter\" level=\"WARN\" additivity=\"false\">\r\n        <appender-ref ref=\"USER_FILE\"/>\r\n    </logger>\r\n\r\nEither of these two solutions should improve your situation while still allowing the community to easily support people who need a bit more help. Thanks.

I think changing the rejection message to `WARN` is a better solution. \r\n\r\nIn thinking back, I believe the reason we didn't do that by default is to prevent log flooding during an attack. If you (an experienced user) set your threshold for the class to `WARN`, you would not get messages for success or failure. If you noticed users being rejected, you could temporarily lower the threshold to diagnose. \r\n\r\nBut I would be ok with rejection generating a `WARN` message, as in the positive case (normal operation) that would be far more useful than an admin missing those messages.
