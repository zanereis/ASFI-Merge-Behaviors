routerC will create as BACKUP. However, we need to destroy routerB as well, then routerC will become MASTER and another new routerD will become BACKUP.\n\nin this processing, we also need to wait some seconds for keepalived/conntrackd on routerC to be up , because we should make sure that the services on BACKUP are running before destroying MASTER.\n\nhence, I think the solution in PR is good (there is only one BACKUP->MASTER state change).\n\nfor the sleep or not, we need to test it. I added it because the test failedout in my testing (without sleep).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/164199095/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/164199618","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1212#issuecomment-164199618","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1212","id":164199618,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NDE5OTYxOA==","user":{"login":"borisroman","id":5996146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5OTYxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5996146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisroman","html_url":"https://github.com/borisroman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisroman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisroman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisroman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisroman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisroman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisroman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisroman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisroman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisroman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-12T22:40:57Z","updated_at":"2015-12-12T22:40:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ustcweizhou Thanks!
