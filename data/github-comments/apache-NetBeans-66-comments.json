Old .xls format was coming for free when using POI and code-wise it was pretty similar to .xlsx, so it made sense to export in that too. Now that we are talking about using two different libraries I think we can skip .xls support because the format is too old, the produced files are larger than .xlsx in general and I don't think adding it adds any actual value.\r\n\r\nI think useing fastexcel is a sensible approach.
