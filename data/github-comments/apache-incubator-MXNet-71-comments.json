If you do not know what caused this error, you can try set environment variable MXNET_ENGINE_TYPEto NaiveEngine and run with debugger (i.e. gdb). This will force all operations to be synchronous and backtrace will give you the series of calls that lead to this error. Remember to set MXNET_ENGINE_TYPE back to empty after debugging.\n\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/218952051/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/218955684","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/2125#issuecomment-218955684","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/2125","id":218955684,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxODk1NTY4NA==","user":{"login":"phunterlau","id":1690881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTA4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1690881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phunterlau","html_url":"https://github.com/phunterlau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phunterlau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phunterlau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phunterlau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phunterlau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phunterlau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phunterlau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phunterlau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phunterlau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phunterlau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-13T05:31:41Z","updated_at":"2016-05-13T05:31:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Oops, sorry my bad: I updated the package but forgot to update python pack.

We can composite linear regression from mx.sym.square(in - out). Then it is a direct output for simple loss. With modifications to `mx.sym.MakeLoss` we can sum loss value and output directly. Existing `mx.sym.LinearRegressionOutput` can cope with `mx.metric` for summed loss value. I think it would be appropriate to leave this documentation in the operator description instead of a developer guide. I will modify `MakeLoss` for this behavior in next pr.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/219265617/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/219265795","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/2136#issuecomment-219265795","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/2136","id":219265795,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxOTI2NTc5NQ==","user":{"login":"ijkguo","id":13162287,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTYyMjg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13162287?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijkguo","html_url":"https://github.com/ijkguo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijkguo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijkguo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijkguo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijkguo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijkguo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijkguo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijkguo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijkguo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijkguo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-15T04:32:38Z","updated_at":"2016-05-15T04:32:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"As for the keyword arguments, I am so sure how to use that appropriately and need an example myself.
