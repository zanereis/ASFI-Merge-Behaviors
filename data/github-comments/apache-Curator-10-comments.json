It can occur when there's connection loss, followed by connection reestablishment followed by connection loss again. Something along the lines of the following occurs.</p>\n\n<p>Assuming retry 3 times, 10 second sleep between retries.</p>\n\n<p>-Connected to ZK<br/>\n-Connection is lost<br/>\n-Start the background sync that occurs on connection loss. This initially fails because there's no connection, and gets put on the retry queue to occur in 10 seconds.</p>\n\n<p>Less than 10 seconds passes and the next two events occur<br/>\n-Connection is reestablished<br/>\n-Connection is lost</p>\n\n<p>After 10 seconds has passed<br/>\n-Background retry from previous connection loss is retried. Fails again, gets requeued etc.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is that this 'synch' process has already used one of its configured retries, so if the connection does not come back before the rest of the retries have expired, then a LOST event is generated. This is why the LOST event is generated more quickly than expected. Under a worst case scenario, it would be possible for the sync process to be on its last retry with a small amount of time left before that retry occurs when connection reestablishment and loss. This would cause the lost event to happen essentially immediately after the reconnected event.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not sure what the best way to fix this is yet. Ideally, we really want to cancel this sync process if a connection is reestablished, because if the connection is lost again, then a new sync process gets generated regardless of whether one is already running. I'm not sure of the logistics of this though.
