Therefore, depending on whether this fix clears away all cast-align warnings, we might be able to use -Wcast-align=strict which makes the warning appear for x86 too, if we are using gcc 8 or higher.

Regard to the current AnnotateTarget pass for BYOC, I have some questions/comments:\r\n\r\n- From the use case, it looks like very similar to the `compiler_begin` and `compiler_end`, but limits to per node. Could you ellaborate the reason why not using `compiler_begin` and `compiler_end` directly?\r\n\r\n- This PR doesn't include a pass to annotate nodes but relies on manual annotation. Could you ellaborate how would you expect users to use them?\r\n\r\n- If we use `compiler_begin` and `compiler_end`, it seems possible to extend existing AnnotateTarget to annotate non-external compilers. The current AnnotateTarget annotates rest nodes to CPU. We could refactor that pass and make CPU and GPU as two \"external\" compilers as well so that AnnotateTarget could also take care of them. I feel that we should only maintain one annotation mechanism at the end, so whatever which approach we finally agree on, we could also refactor BYOC AnnotateTarget pass in that way.\r\n\r\nAlso cc

Hi Andrew. The change looks good (I'll differ the review of `Jenkinsfile` to others). I just suggest to fit docstrings of `get_standalone_crt_dir` and `get_standalone_crt_lib()` in 80 columns maximum. Also, a side note on the PR itself, if possible, I'd avoid merges in the middle of the incremental changes pushed to the branch to be reviewed, because it makes a tad difficult to squash the commits into the final change, in that sense I think rebasing on top of master is better. I tested `micro_tflite.py` against a disco board too and it's good. So, thumbs up from my side.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/776294700/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/776327280","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7404#issuecomment-776327280","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7404","id":776327280,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3NjMyNzI4MA==","user":{"login":"icemelon","id":2696494,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTY0OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2696494?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon","html_url":"https://github.com/icemelon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-09T23:58:58Z","updated_at":"2021-02-09T23:58:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks

I forgot about the \"constraint\" on push -f. Maybe the only thing we could do is to try to avoid merging in the middle of the incremental pushes (pushes due to the review process)? On the other hand  that amounts to not doing a rebase on the top of the most fresh code in `main`, but I wonder if github and the CI is actually already covering what might go wrong if rebase is not done (github will check for merge conflicts on top of the `main` branch, but I'm not sure about the CI, I guess it only builds and tests the branch ones want to merge into `main`, i.e. it doesn't build the commits found in github's \"Commits\" tab on top of the `main` branch). Yep, tricky thing, merging in the middle of the incremental pushes for complicated changes might get really hard to review.

for the discussion, and sorry for the late reply!\r\n\r\nTo clarify:\r\n- Target `tag`s are an alias and an efficient way to create concrete targets. For example, `nvidia/rtx2080ti` is short for \"cuda -arch sm_75 -shared_memory_per_block 49152 -registers_per_block 65536 -thread_warp_size 32\".\r\n- Target `kind`s mean specifically the codegen target, i.e. do we codegen to LLVM IR (where the kind is \"llvm\"), or CUDA C (where the kind is \"cuda\"), etc. We write `kind` as the first term in the target string.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/777098967/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/777100312","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7427#issuecomment-777100312","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7427","id":777100312,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3NzEwMDMxMg==","user":{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-10T23:15:04Z","updated_at":"2021-02-10T23:15:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I agree with @leandron and @comaniac.

\r\n> \r\n> @manupa-arm @grant-arm it seems to me that this change is replacing pointer dereferences to `**strm` with `memcpy`. this is the correct thing to do, so now we just need to test it. the issue now is that it compiles fine, but at runtime would trigger an unaligned load. this issue should be present across platforms. I think we could write a test that intentionally calls `TVMNDArray_Load` with unaligned `strm`. i'm not suggesting we need to test every single case of mis-alignment, but a single test that calls TVMNDArray_Load with unaligned `strm` should be sufficient to trigger the failure without this patch.\r\n\r\n\r\nSorry to jump in but I think a couple of points need to be considered here. \r\nYou need an architecture that traps on unaligned accesses. AFAIK, that's not x86_64 in these cases. And thus it is unlikely that you will provoke this AFAIK. this is one of the common cases where things go wrong in this case. AFAIK it will not trap on x86_64. This is a common problem when undefined C is ported between x86_64 and architectures that have strict alignment. My understanding is that you will not see this failure. \r\n\r\nI will point out that once we start running tests on Corstone 300 (Cortex-M + Ethos-U), note that the runtime will run on the Cortex-M and publish that upstream in a month or so, there will be a test on a target in the CI that actually breaks for this. After all if the runtime fails with misaligned faults it's fairly fundamental to running any tests.\r\n\r\n-Wcast-align=strict works well across all architectures as an option from GCC-8 ( notably it wouldn't work on x86_64 even if the variant of -Wcast-align=strict was setup in GCC 7 as IIRC x86_64 is not a STRICT_ALIGNMENT target in GCC parlance). The default compiler in CI is from Ubuntu 18.04 and thus will not show up on x86_64 in GCC-7  . \r\n\r\n$> gcc -Wcast-align=strict /tmp/tst.c \r\ngcc: error: unrecognized command line option ‘-Wcast-align=strict’; did you mean ‘-Wcast-align’?\r\n$> gcc -v\r\ngcc version 7.5.0 (Ubuntu 7.5.0-3ubuntu1~18.04) \r\n\r\nI would suggest fixing the issue, it's undefined C .\r\n\r\nYes it's nice to have a test but that will come automatically with testing initial support for Ethos-U55 in the Corstone300 FVP or any Cortex-M test that runs on an FVP. \r\n\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nRamana\r\n> \r\n> ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/777399529/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
