If we wrote this unit test, the unit test would look like in two ways\r\n    a. In unit test, check GuidePostsInfo.GetEstimatedSize() is equal to a constant value or a value calculated in the ways mentioned in https://dzone.com/articles/estimating-java-object-sizes or https://github.com/twitter/commons/blob/master/src/java/com/twitter/common/objectsize/ObjectSizeCalculator.java. The former is useless if the developer forgot to change \"int estimatedSize = ...\" in GuidePostsInfo's constructor, and the latter can only get an approximation of the object size.\r\n    b. In unit test, list and check all the fields in GuidePostInfo are equal to what we have now. It seems overkilled and weird.\r\n2. We need to refactor GuidePostsInfo in the near future.

the problem with that approach is that there are certain fields that are set inside `init` and changing those fields would require us to change other fields, for example, changing the columns would require us to recompute the `estimatedSize`, `pkColumns`, etc. so it's not sufficient to return the builder and then just set whatever are the new properties. On top of this, the developer would need to keep track of the fact that `init` needs to be called again after some fields are changed, which is error-prone. I feel that we should keep this abstracted away. Let me know what you think.

of all, apologies for loooong PR._ (Most of it is refactoring but still its hard to review)\r\n\r\n**Here's the high level idea** \r\n1. 7 classes were inherited from `StatsCollectorIT`, testing stats collection for different types of table properties. There was a lot of redundancy in the test suite. Also, all the tests were running with namespaces enabled all the time (This is because it is set once for the JVM and we cannot go back without restarting the server). We were controlling the parameterized property for new `PhoenixConnection`, which is disallowed according to documentation.\r\nThe code is now refactored to have only 3 classes, \r\n`NamespaceMappedStatsCollectorIT` --> namespaces enabled, collect stats via snapshots as well as SQL statement\r\n`NonTxStatsCollectorIT` --> mutable/immutable tables, column encoded/non column encoded\r\n`TxStatsCollectorIT` --> mutable/immutable tables, column encoded/non column encoded, TEPHRA/OMID\r\n\r\n2. The `StatsCollectorIT` is renamed to `BaseStatsCollectorIT` and tests have been improved to cover certain scenarios. More tests coming along the way.\r\n\r\n3. Server side changes:\r\n`DefaultStatisticsCollector` is now an abstract class, `RegionServerStatisticsCollector` and `MapperStatisticsCollector` are its children. The former is triggered for SQL statements and the latter is used for this Jira (Map Reduce Job). Most of the common code is moved to base class.\r\n\r\n4. The snapshot scanner has been improved to collect statistics if the scan is configured accordingly. A `NoOpStatisticsCollector` instance is instantiated if its a regular phoenix MR job on snapshots. \r\n\r\n5. Also have the configuration changes in `PhoenixConfigurationUtil` class.\r\n\r\nFinally, `UpdateStatisticsTool` is the tool to launch the MR job.\r\n\r\nThis is the v1 version for some initial feedback. Please comment wherever its not clear.\r\n\r\n**Coming up:** \r\nMore tests covering other scenarios.\r\nPerf testing for sample tables and the results.\r\nBetter/useful log lines\r\nGeneral code cleanup for nits","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/448905178/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/449115620","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/phoenix/pull/419#issuecomment-449115620","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/419","id":449115620,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0OTExNTYyMA==","user":{"login":"karanmehta93","id":6191256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxOTEyNTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6191256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karanmehta93","html_url":"https://github.com/karanmehta93","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karanmehta93/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karanmehta93/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karanmehta93/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karanmehta93/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karanmehta93/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karanmehta93/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karanmehta93/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karanmehta93/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karanmehta93/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-20T19:49:03Z","updated_at":"2018-12-20T19:49:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@twdsilva @ChinmaySKulkarni @joshelser @chrajeshbabu @dbwong @BinShi-SecularBird\r\n\r\nPlease review.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/449115620/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/449128307","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/phoenix/pull/419#issuecomment-449128307","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/419","id":449128307,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0OTEyODMwNw==","user":{"login":"ChinmaySKulkarni","id":4160016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNjAwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4160016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChinmaySKulkarni","html_url":"https://github.com/ChinmaySKulkarni","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChinmaySKulkarni/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChinmaySKulkarni/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChinmaySKulkarni/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChinmaySKulkarni/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChinmaySKulkarni/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChinmaySKulkarni/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChinmaySKulkarni/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChinmaySKulkarni/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChinmaySKulkarni/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-20T20:38:47Z","updated_at":"2018-12-20T20:38:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@karanmehta93 can you provide URLs to some design docs/basic stats docs?
