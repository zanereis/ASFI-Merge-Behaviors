Also the resource settings included are generic across packing algo, like default instance resources and resource per component. These are also set by the packing algo based on user settings or configs. They're required to generate a packing plan with resources from the InstanceIds.\n\nOne thing we did realize is that `RoundRobinPacking` handles plan creation differently than the others (as a result it can over-allocate) so that class might not be able to upgrade to use the packing builder. We might just deprecate that one if we're able to replace it with the `ResourceCompliantRRPacking` impl.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/252772368/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/253033576","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/1471#issuecomment-253033576","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1471","id":253033576,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MzAzMzU3Ng==","user":{"login":"avflor","id":18666312,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjY2MzEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18666312?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor","html_url":"https://github.com/avflor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-11T20:20:26Z","updated_at":"2016-10-11T20:20:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@billonahill I think I addressed all your comments.

And the scaling is done by re-partitioning the operator state. I will send you our paper about run-time operator scaling if you are interested. I am wondering how you plan to deal with operator state when scaling up or down. Will you store the operator state to a persistent store before scaling? Will you consider live scaling without deactivating the current topology? \n\nFor (2), we have a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.03610.pdf) that utilizes the Queueing Theory to determine the optimal parallelism of each operator given the user-defined tuple processing latency constraint. The first step of the algorithm is to reason about the minimal parallelism of each operator to avoid being the performance bottleneck. This is can be easily computed by $\\lambda/u$, where $\\lambda$ and $u$ is the arrival rate and the operator currently processing rate respectively. \n\nI have implemented the auto-scaling functionality based on Storm. And I am willing to make contributions to Heron on this feature.\n\nThanks.\nLi\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/254102507/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/254104598","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1422#issuecomment-254104598","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1422","id":254104598,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NDEwNDU5OA==","user":{"login":"kramasamy","id":367684,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzY4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/367684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy","html_url":"https://github.com/kramasamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-17T03:26:53Z","updated_at":"2016-10-17T03:26:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@wangli1426

I believe we need a central external unit to do the state migration as we will avoid many coordination problems between stream managers. \n\nI agree with you. Stream manager alone is not sufficient. As stated in my proposal, we need a centralized scaling delegate to coordinate the state migration and the rerouting. For instance, before a key is migrated from a HeronInstance to another, we need to make sure all the tuples sent to the HeronInstance has been completed processed. \n\n> There are multiple things that need to be synchronized: we need to make sure tuples are not routed to the original bolts while migrating the state of the bolts, we need to know when all state migrations have been completed so that processing is resumed, we need to handle failures (e.g, a new bolt failed while receiving state).\n\nYes, to migrate a set of key, say `k` from HeronInstance A to HeronInstance B, we need the following steps.\n1) stop sending tuples with keys in `k` to A;\n2) make sure all tuples with keys in `k` sent to A has been processed;\n3) migrate  the involved state from A to B;\n4) resume sending tuples with keys in `key` to B.\n\n> Moreover, I'm not sure how we will make the heron instance understand that it is not receiving regular data tuples through the stream manager but some other bolt's state.\n\nWe can add additional fields to `HeronTuples.HeronDataTuple` to indicate whether a tuple is a regular tuple or control tuple, and process the tuples properly at [BoltInstance.java:216](https://github.com/twitter/heron/blob/master/heron/simulator/src/java/com/twitter/heron/simulator/instance/BoltInstance.java#L216) like this:\n\n``` java\n      for (HeronTuples.HeronDataTuple dataTuple : tuples.getData().getTuplesList()) {\n        if(dataTuple.type == ControlTuple) {\n             //do the control work such as state migration, state merging.\n        } else\n            handleDataTuple(dataTuple, topologyContext, stream);\n      }\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/254429046/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/254589105","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/1498#issuecomment-254589105","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1498","id":254589105,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NDU4OTEwNQ==","user":{"login":"objmagic","id":3656079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NTYwNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3656079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic","html_url":"https://github.com/objmagic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-18T18:01:43Z","updated_at":"2016-10-18T18:01:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> CuratorStateManager.java:80: Line is longer than 100 characters (found 155).

Regarding moving existing state when increasing parallelism, in the above flow how exactly do you determine which keys k need to move? Would we have to run all current keys in A through the updated hashing algorithm or is there a better way?\n> Q2.) Related to Q1 but your example shows how to migrate state from A -> B, but when adding new instances we'd be going from Set_n -> Set_n + Set_m. Would we need to inspect keys on all Set_n to see what needs to move to Set_m? \n\nThis is a good question. A naive method is to change the hash function when new task is created. This method however results in a large number of state migration. For instance, if we increase the number of tasks from `n` to `n+m`, then for each task approximately `(n+m-1)/(n+m)` of the keys will be migrated to other tasks, which results in expensive state migration overhead and significant scaling delay. Another method is to maintain a key-to-task mapping in the routing table. This allows us to reassign a few keys to the new tasks when scaling. However, the maintaining overhead could be large and the lookup to the mapping will cause a large number of cache misses when there are many distinct keys. My idea is to use a two-tire routing table. We logically partition the key space of an operator into many, e.g., 512, mini-partitions, called _shards_. This can be done by a global hash function. And we maintain shard-to-task mapping and monitor the workload on each shard. When a new task is created, we can reassign some shards from existing tasks to the new one based on the workload of the shards. This problem is similar to Multi-way partition problem which divides a set of n integers into a given number k of subsets, minimizing the difference between the smallest and the largest subset sums. The difference is that we also want to minimize the shard reassignments. This problem can be solved by using a heuristic algorithm similar to First-Fit-Decreasing. The benefit of the two-tire routing is that it gives us great flexibility to minimize the shard reassignments while does not bring much additional overhead. The shard reassignments enabled by the two-tire routing not only supports operator scaling, but also can be used for inter-task load balancing when the workload is skewed among the tasks. \n\n> Q3.) Re implementation, could this be done with composition instead of inheritance? This would provide more flexibility to the topology author. So instead of extending the operator the bolt could implement StatefulComponent which could cause a configured implementation of a StateStore to be injected by the framework, or something like that.\n\nThe `ElasticStatefulOperator` also exposes some methods to the system for state management, like this:\n\n``` java\npublic abstract class ElasticStatefulOperator implements Serializable {\n\n    private KeyValueState state = new KeyValueState();\n    ...\n\n   // to extract a subset of state for migration\n   KeyValueState getState(StateFilter filter){...};\n\n   // to merge the new state migrated to the current instance\n   void MergeState(KeyValueState newState){...};\n\n}\n```\n\nIf this is done with composition instead of inheritance, I am afraid the system cannot get access to the StatefulComponent member in their class.\n\n> Also we might want to avoid terminology specific to scaling (i.e., elastic) since this functionality wouldn't be limited to just scaling. It might be used when a faulty node gets restarted for example.\n\nI agree. A better name might to be `StatefulOperator`, `StatefulBolt` or `StatefulKeyValueOperator`. We can choose a proper name after we have reached an agreement on the design.\n\nThanks.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/254702959/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/254726449","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/1496#issuecomment-254726449","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1496","id":254726449,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NDcyNjQ0OQ==","user":{"login":"kramasamy","id":367684,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzY4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/367684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy","html_url":"https://github.com/kramasamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-19T06:49:37Z","updated_at":"2016-10-19T06:49:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@objmagic -
