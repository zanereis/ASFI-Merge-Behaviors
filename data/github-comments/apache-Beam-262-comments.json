has advised me to find a reviewer that is more familiar with side inputs. \r\nr: @charlesccychen could you take a look?\r\n\r\nA quick summary of the change:\r\nIn the Insights team we're working on a project to keep track of time spent / bytes read from side inputs, so that users may be better informed of bottlenecks in their pipelines.\r\nFor this, we track msecs spent *blocked* waiting for side inputs (so, only when the Queue is empty ahead of time).\r\n\r\nAn interesting, and perhaps counter-intuitive scenario that we're planning for is the following dummy example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsi_iterable = AsIter(p | Create(long_list))\r\n\r\ndef emit_side_input(e, si_iter):\r\n  yield si_iter\r\n\r\npcoll = p \r\n  | Create([0]) \r\n  | 'step1' >> beam.Map(emit_side_input, si_iter=si_iterable) \r\n  | 'step2' >> beam.FlatMap(lambda x: list(x))\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, `step1` emits the iterable, and `step2` is the one that actually may be blocked waiting for side inputs. That's why we need to check the current step when the thread blocks.\r\n\r\nI'd like a review of the approach, and I'll come back with benchmark results soon. Hope it's not much trouble, Charles.

That is what is going wrong now. We have previously had issues with the scripts referencing maven profiles and whatnot which either do or do not exist when needed. It has only gotten worse, and I expect the trend to continue, since the flaw is conceptual.\r\n\r\nWhen we moved from Travis to Jenkins I wanted to keep this property of tests evolving with code, which Travis-CI has naturally, by having a script in the repo that Jenkins would invoke. This also minimizes Jenkins churn, which is quite tedious to debug and very hard to test in advance.\r\n\r\nThere were some specious objections about execution of arbitrary code, which you can always do and is sort of the point. Beyond that, the tight integration with Jenkins plugins may not be possible. The current issue is strong evidence that technical necessity outweighs those niceties.\r\n\r\nIt is some real work, but if the hacks below don't immediately solve things, it may be simplest to move in the right direction here and alter the Jenkins jobs to just invoke a script so it can be different on `master` and this branch.\r\n\r\n> The error is \"Could not find the selected project in the reactor: sdks/python/container\". Someone with maven knowledge can comment on why that is happening.\r\n\r\nThis is happening because `sdks/python/container` does not exist, just as the discussion has mentioned. The Python precommit specifies `--projects 'sdks/python,!sdks/python/container'` to avoid building the container. It is unfortunate that this is a fatal error.\r\n\r\nPossibilities:\r\n\r\n - One hack to avoid this would be to control this with a profile, which is not a fatal error if missing. The new toggle would be  `--activate-profiles '!python-container'`. That is not a good long-term solution because poms are gross enough with hacks kept to a minimum.\r\n - We could also remove the `--also-make-dependents` since I think the Python SDKs model of including all code in a single module makes it irrelevant. My experience trying to run build all submodules, as with `--projects runners` is that it does _not_ build submodules by default, so you can build `--projects sdks/python` and it will not automatically build the submodule.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/336003494/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/336004037","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3986#issuecomment-336004037","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3986","id":336004037,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNjAwNDAzNw==","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-12T02:40:13Z","updated_at":"2017-10-12T02:40:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Nice.
