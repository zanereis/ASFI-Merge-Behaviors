@markusthoemmes @csantanapr \r\nPlease review this.\r\n\r\nTo recall, let me recap the changes.\r\n\r\n1. Socat container.\r\nThis is to enable docker remote api with docker for mac.\r\n\r\n2. Docker-machine and Mac environment in ansible.\r\nWith this pr, there will be one more environment in ansible, `docker-machine`.\r\nThis environment is kept for those who use OW with docker-machine.\r\nIn the future, this environment will be deprecated.\r\nSo, now `mac` environment means Docker for mac environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Convert `AkkaHttpUtils` to `Play-ws client`\r\nSince `AkkaHttpUtils` does not support proxy configuration, http client is changed to `play-ws`.\r\nThere is no change in logic.\r\n\r\n4. Squid proxy container\r\nThis is only to run unit tests with Docker for mac.\r\nIt will forward all the requests to a given target container.\r\n\r\nSince there was no retry-delay on connection error in upstream squid proxy, following tests failed.\r\n\r\n```\r\nactionContainers.DockerExampleContainerTests > bad containers should timeout bad proxy with exception FAILED\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I added retry-delay, manually compiled it and built docker container.\r\nNow it works as expected.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne remaining task is update [this](https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/pull/1790/files#diff-5a5d069dcad99a9f8109ac77d1b9860cR60) to my manually built squid container.\r\n\r\nI think it would be the best to publish that squid container to [openwhisk namespace](https://hub.docker.com/u/openwhisk/) in docker hub.\r\nBut if it's not possible, I will publish it in my namesapce.(ex:

`wsk rule update <ruleName> <trigger> <action> -v` shows a PUT request with the body: `{{\"name\":\"<rule>\",\"status\":\"\",\"trigger\":\"/_/<trigger>\",\"action\":\"/_/<action>\"}}`. We can see `status` gets sent as a falsy value, which was my first thought as to what would be causing the problem. To make this even more confusing, the response that comes back shows the rule with a status of `active`.\r\n\r\nEven after rebuilding the CLI to send `status: active`, Scala will still return a response that contains an \"active\" status rule, even though GETing the rule shows that it is still `inactive`, which pretty much confirms @dubeejw thoughts that this is purely a Scala controller issue (though the initial CLI update/PUT request should still send the current status of the rule instead of null).\r\n\r\nIt looks like here: https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/blob/master/core/controller/src/main/scala/whisk/core/controller/Rules.scala#L85\r\nthat no matter what the status actually is, we just send back an active status in the response, even though that may not be the actual status of the rule.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/309803448/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/309809369","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/2402#issuecomment-309809369","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/2402","id":309809369,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwOTgwOTM2OQ==","user":{"login":"dubee","id":11520887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIwODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11520887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee","html_url":"https://github.com/dubee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-20T16:12:03Z","updated_at":"2017-06-20T16:12:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Needs
