Daffodil does not have the same transformational capabilities that Jolt has (e.g. filtering, sorting, reordering). It really just takes a data format that is not natively supported and transforms it to a logically similar representation in a natively supported format (i.e. XML/JSON). If your data is already in something like XML or JSON, it doesn't really make sense to use Daffodil.\r\n\r\nSo for example, you might take PCAP data, like in the above template, and feed it through Daffodill to transform it to JSON. But there might be extraneous data that Daffodil parsed that you don't need or care about. So you might then feed that JSON through Jolt to to transform it to something that has only the fields you care about, or is reordered/renamed to be something more useful to ones usecase.\r\n\r\nSo this isn't something that could be viewed as an alternative to Jolt, but more like something that could be used in conjunction with Jolt to allow one to transform JSON data that wasn't originally JSON.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/437049005/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/437081927","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3130#issuecomment-437081927","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3130","id":437081927,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNzA4MTkyNw==","user":{"login":"ottobackwards","id":1111551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTE1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards","html_url":"https://github.com/ottobackwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-08T17:14:22Z","updated_at":"2018-11-08T17:14:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for taking the time to explain further.

I had gone down this path before but I backed out the changes. The changes in this PR will result in obtaining a Write Lock on the queue of every incoming connection for every running processor in the graph. This can become quite expensive for a complex flow that is made up of thousands (or even 10's of thousands) of processors) and result in overall system performance suffering. This is why we are so care in the FlowFile Queue's implementation to ensure that isActiveQueueEmpty() never obtains a lock but instead only references AtomicReference variables.\r\n\r\nWe should be able to do better, though. For example, when we pull a FlowFile from the queue, we check if it's penalized. If so, we throw it back on. Since the queue is ordered, we could do some smart things like looking at the FlowFile expiration date, then keeping track of the fact that we know all FlowFiles are penalized until that time is reached - or until a non-penalized FlowFile is added to the queue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/437472748/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/437475859","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3111#issuecomment-437475859","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3111","id":437475859,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNzQ3NTg1OQ==","user":{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-09T19:51:12Z","updated_at":"2018-11-09T19:51:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@arkadius I did a good bit of testing and wasn't able to break anything.

First, we do the standard check on `isActiveQueueEmpty`. This happens in the code now as you mentioned, and right now if this passes we create a writelock, `migrateSwapToActive()`, and call the processor.\r\n\r\nAll my change does is add one additional check, but only if `isActiveQueueEmpty` is already passing. So as far as I can tell, I'm locking one extra time for a queue that is already going to get locked, but not locking any queues that would not already get locked. Also, because I'm calling `migrateSwapToActive()` during my check, when the processor does get called the lock for the second run of this method should not last as long as it would otherwise, as there is less work to do. So overall lock time should be affected only minimally.

We'd want to gather some performance numbers before and after this changeset is applied.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I'd want to setup a test suite that calculates things like:\r\nHow long does it take to check if there are FlowFiles queued 10 million times when there are no FlowFiles queued?\r\nHow long does it take to check if there are FlowFiles queued 10 million times when there are FlowFiles queued?\r\nHow do these numbers change when you have 1 thread vs. 2 threads vs. 12 threads vs. 25 threads?\r\n\r\nI'd want to run these tests 10-20 times in a row to ensure that the numbers are steady, and then get these numbers before and after the changeset is applied.\r\nIf the worst-case differs by say 5% then it's probably fine.

With QDT it doesn't take incoming flow files, so the table name is effectively hard-coded. By adding PrimaryNodeOnly we can guarantee that QDT only has one instance (it is already TriggerSerially so can't have multiple threads). For GTF if you use ListDatabaseTables on the primary node only (not sure if we should force that with this annotation or not) then each flow file should have a different table, and using a load-balanced connection (or RPG -> Input Port) then each instance of GTF should be working on a different table. The onus is on the user to set Max Concurrent Tasks for GTF to 1 to prevent multi-threaded execution.\r\n\r\nPerhaps for GTF, instead of forcing PrimaryNodeOnly, we can make it clear in the doc that if there are no incoming connections, it should probably be run on the primary node only. Alternatively, maybe during annotation processing we can enforce that processors annotated with PrimaryNodeOnly automatically have an InputRequirement of INPUT_FORBIDDEN? Otherwise flow files can get stalled if they are in the queue on a node that is not the

is interesting stuff, I need to read more up on DFDL, might make a good schema definition language as an alternative to Avro schemas. Also at first glance it seems the Daffodil infoset is analogous to a NiFi Record for data, and/or a NiFi RecordSchema for its schema. Having an infoset as the underlying data model seems to overlap a bit with how the NiFi Record stuff works, for example we could have a PCAPReader and any writer such as JSONWriter, then the ConvertRecord processor can convert PCAP to JSON. I think someone was working on a PCAP reader, not sure how they handled the global stuff. If Avro schemas are not sufficient to capture this kind of model, then we should definitely look at DFDL as an alternative (we've been considering XSD as a more expressive alternative).\r\n\r\nQuick note about JOLT, the \"normal\" use case is for JSON-to-JSON conversion, but the underlying library does the transformation on a POJO, not JSON. So the usual entry point for JOLT is to give it a JSON string, it converts to a POJO, runs the transformation, and takes the resulting POJO and writes it out as JSON. In NiFi I wrote JoltTransformRecord, which instead of explicit JSON uses the NiFi Record API, so it gets each record (in whichever format) as a NiFi Record, translates it to a POJO, then runs the JOLT transforms, then translates back into a NiFi Record, which is written out in whatever format is specified by the RecordWriter.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/437940950/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/437948562","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1953#issuecomment-437948562","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1953","id":437948562,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNzk0ODU2Mg==","user":{"login":"bdesert","id":19496093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDk2MDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19496093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdesert","html_url":"https://github.com/bdesert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdesert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdesert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdesert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdesert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdesert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdesert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdesert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdesert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdesert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-12T16:41:34Z","updated_at":"2018-11-12T16:41:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Reviewing...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/437948562/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/437976693","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3129#issuecomment-437976693","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3129","id":437976693,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNzk3NjY5Mw==","user":{"login":"jtstorck","id":19271493,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjcxNDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19271493?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck","html_url":"https://github.com/jtstorck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-12T18:07:46Z","updated_at":"2018-11-12T18:07:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mcgilman

But as far as complex types, it only really supports \"records\" and arrays. Below is the list of things in Avro that the DFDL infoset does not support:\r\n\r\n* It sort of supports enums, but only in the sense that it can validate that a primitive type is one of the valid enum values via the xsd:restriction.\r\n* Maps. In DFDL, a map would be implemented as a sequence of key/value pairs, so there wouldn't be any enforcement of unique keys.\r\n* Unions. Each element in the infoset must have an explicit primitive type. Each element can be optional or nulled, but cannot be a union of multiple primitive types. In DFDL, that is handled by an xs:choice of two different elements with different types and some method (often a discriminator) to determine which branch of the choice.\r\n* Namespaces are slightly different, but probably similar enough. DFDL uses XML namespacing.\r\n* Aliases are not supported.\r\n* Sort order. DFDL outputs infoset elements in the order in which they appear in schema.\r\n* The DFDL infoset does not contain the schema. One must keep track of the associated schema outside of the data.\r\n* The isn't really a concept of different serializations like Avro looks to have. Instead, the DFDL schema defines the physical data format via DFDL annotations, which are used to determine how to serialize/deserialize data. Theoretically, one could have different schemas with the same logical format but with with different DFDL annotations to describe physical formats, but that isn't a comment use case we've come across.\r\n\r\nThe Daffodil devs would be happen to discuss the possibility of integrating Daffodil/DFDL as an alternative to Avro. Not sure if any of the above limitations are blockers. The core of Avro and DFDL definitely do seem to have some overlap.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/438269040/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/438295675","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3011#issuecomment-438295675","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3011","id":438295675,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzODI5NTY3NQ==","user":{"login":"MikeThomsen","id":108184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODE4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen","html_url":"https://github.com/MikeThomsen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-13T14:58:16Z","updated_at":"2018-11-13T14:58:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @zenfenan.

That warning is due to accessing, via reflection, the `pid` method on the Process API, which was added in Java 9.  The code that does this was added by NIFI-5175, to allow NiFI built on Java 1.8 to run on Java 9.  There's a comment in the code detailing why the use of reflection is necessary.  Please see https://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/master/nifi-bootstrap/src/main/java/org/apache/nifi/bootstrap/util/OSUtils.java#L111.\r\n\r\nThe warning is expected, and when we have a minimum requirement of Java 11, we can refactor OSUtils, or probably remove the class entirely, since the Process API (as of Java 9) provides a platform independent way to get a PID.  I don't think we'll need to have the methods in OSUtils for getting the PID based on which platform on which NiFi is running.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/439443999/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/439472785","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3107#issuecomment-439472785","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3107","id":439472785,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzOTQ3Mjc4NQ==","user":{"login":"yjhyjhyjh0","id":4414486,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTQ0ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4414486?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yjhyjhyjh0","html_url":"https://github.com/yjhyjhyjh0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yjhyjhyjh0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yjhyjhyjh0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yjhyjhyjh0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yjhyjhyjh0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yjhyjhyjh0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yjhyjhyjh0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yjhyjhyjh0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yjhyjhyjh0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yjhyjhyjh0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-16T17:49:33Z","updated_at":"2018-11-16T17:49:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks
