Kafka had used Zookeeper 3.3.4 recently. Then, almost projects only upgrade their libraries when they found some big bugs or necessary features. In this case, when you introduce this upgrade feature, we don't need to upgrade its library because it worked well. But after upgrading jetty from 8 to 9, we found bugs and need to upgrade or fix some related versions. AFAIK, it needs later servlet version and it causes to upgrade jersey version. Still, I don't know why we keep cxf and jersey at the same time for a long time, but if your PR passes CI and works proper when reviewers test it, we can consider removing cxf and change jersey2 fully. Anyway, thanks for the contribution and I appreciate and encourage your contribution.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/295239587/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/295239766","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2182#issuecomment-295239766","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2182","id":295239766,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NTIzOTc2Ng==","user":{"login":"jongyoul","id":3612566,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTI1NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3612566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul","html_url":"https://github.com/jongyoul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-19T12:00:54Z","updated_at":"2017-04-19T12:00:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hold until concluding #932 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/295239766/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/295333692","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2262#issuecomment-295333692","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2262","id":295333692,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NTMzMzY5Mg==","user":{"login":"jongyoul","id":3612566,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTI1NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3612566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul","html_url":"https://github.com/jongyoul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-19T16:30:17Z","updated_at":"2017-04-19T16:30:17Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@hammertank Hi, thanks for the contribution but do you or your team use zeppelin 0.6.x?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/295333692/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/295337128","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2253#issuecomment-295337128","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2253","id":295337128,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NTMzNzEyOA==","user":{"login":"jongyoul","id":3612566,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTI1NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3612566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul","html_url":"https://github.com/jongyoul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-19T16:38:59Z","updated_at":"2017-04-19T16:38:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Tested.
