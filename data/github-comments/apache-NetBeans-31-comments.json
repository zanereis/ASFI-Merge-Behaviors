We can't take that road, as there are different pros and cons to choose the build system and the option needs to be there. So the user needs to choose and needs information to base its decision on. Given that the difference between the two options is the build system I don't see why that fact should be hidden and why that would help the developer at all.\r\n\r\nBefore the the change there was:\r\n- Java: An ant based project with netbeans specific project files\r\n- Maven: A maven based project without any netbeans specifics\r\n\r\nNo we have:\r\n- Java\r\n- Ant Java\r\n\r\nSo what tells me what \"Java\" does? If my peer group says \"gradle\" is _the_ build system, I would expect that to be created. Bummer - does not happen - there is some file \"pom.xml\" generated, but no  \"build.gradle\". You can replace \"gradle\" with $featured build system. So why not:\r\n\r\n- Java (maven based)\r\n- Java (ant based)\r\n\r\nPutting maven first, indicates to order \"we\" suggest and lets the user choose.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/443535795/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/443536508","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/1038#issuecomment-443536508","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/1038","id":443536508,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MzUzNjUwOA==","user":{"login":"vieiro","id":564140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NDE0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/564140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro","html_url":"https://github.com/vieiro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-02T19:52:26Z","updated_at":"2018-12-02T19:52:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@eppleton Oh, of course we all want the best for the user.
