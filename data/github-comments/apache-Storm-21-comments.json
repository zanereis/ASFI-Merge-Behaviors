clear about the issue completely. Currently we have some code in AutoTGT that attempts auto login to hadoop if hadoop is in the classPath. Is this task asking for implementation to ensure we check if HDFS and HBASE is in class path and if yes, fetch delegation tokens and store it? Shouldn't this be part of HDFS and HBASE bolts, where the actual interactions would happen? Or this issue is just for creating a helper so clients that use HDFS and HBASE can get delegation token using this helper?</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612469478/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612472005","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4203#issuecomment-2612472005","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4203","id":2612472005,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI0NzIwMDU=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-06-24T17:22:09Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T12:57:00Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=githubbot\">githubbot</a>:</i>\n<p>GitHub user harshach opened a pull request:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/incubator-storm/pull/159\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/incubator-storm/pull/159</a></p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-361\" title=\"Add JSON-P support to Storm UI API\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"STORM-361\"><del>STORM-361</del></a>.

href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=revans2\">revans2</a>:</i>\n<p>Sorry I did throw up a design or explain this very well.</p>\n\n<p>IAutoCredentials right now only has APIs to fetch credentials on the client side, and then use them on the topology side to populate a Subject.  For this we need to extend it so that it could also fetch the credentials on nimbus when the topology is submitted (if it is configured to do so).</p>\n\n<p>So for an HDFS delegation token I would expect the code to do something like the following.</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>The client would submit a topology with a config set that says it wants hdfs delegation tokens. i.e. topology.autohdfs.namenodes=<span class=\"error\">&#91;\"hdfs://foo.com/\",\"hdfs://bar.com\"&#93;</span></li>\n\t<li>Nimbus before if finished submitting the topology it runs the configured IAutoCredentials instances (Probably need a new config for this, or extend ICredentialsRenewer to also take the topology config).\n\t<ol>\n\t\t<li>AutoHDFS would look at the config and become a proxy user for the different NameNodes to fetch the delegation token and put it into the credentials.</li>\n\t</ol>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>On the topology side AutoHDFS would take the delegation token and populate it into the UGI.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n<p>Periodically Nimbus would run AutoHDFS as an ICredentialsRenewer.  If the token needs to be renewed it would connect to the name node and renew it.  If the renewal period is about to expire it would fetch a new delegation token, and replace the old one in the credentials map.</p>\n\n<p>For HBase it should be similar, but replace hdfs with hbase.  I have heard though that for this to work properly hbase may need a fix too.  Some people I have talked to have indicated that the RPC layer of HBase caches the delegation token, so even if it is updated in the UGI it will not be used to make new connections to HBase, but I don't know for
