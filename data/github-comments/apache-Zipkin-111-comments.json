X-B3-TraceId \"^(.{0,16}).*$\" \"$1\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n`%{reqenv:UNIQUE_ID}` is a unique string generated by mod_unique_id. Then, it gets MD5-hashed and assigned to the `X-B3-TraceId` header. This gives a 32-character hex string = 128 bit traceId. Since my downstream libraries require the traceIds to be 64-bit, the `RequestHeader edit` extracts the first 16 characters (64 bit) from the value and reassigns it back to the `X-B3-TraceId` header which is sent

Whether it is linked or not to the parent pom may change depending on how we proceed.. For example, if we break the flow such that maven doesn't control making the images later tested.. then there's I suppose not much point in having this linked.\r\n\r\n>> docker action instead of maven plugin...\r\n\r\nhmm so if I understand correctly, you mean to start the flow with docker action, then run mvn to run the docker tests, as opposed to implicitly doing that with a docker plugin.\r\n\r\n## flow option 1: use maven the whole way (when in maven)\r\n\r\n1. docker action runs maven to..\r\n  1. run normal server build\r\n  2. uses plugin to build Dockerfile using the built jar\r\n  3. executes testcontainers tests\r\n\r\nchange needed: small change to Dockerfile to use zipkin exec jar built by maven\r\n\r\npros:\r\n * use can fire and forget (execute one command and come back later)\r\n * IDE is aware of everything\r\ncons:\r\n * If the docker plugin becomes abandoned, this has to be revisited\r\n * a change to the Dockerfile is needed, even if it is a small one\r\n * unless you break the maven build into two github action steps, caching/resume would be too coarse grained\r\n * the docker parts are implicit so less easy to see in the github action steps\r\n\r\n## flow option 2: flip between docker action and maven\r\n\r\n1. docker action step builds Dockerfile (which internally runs maven build)\r\n2. docker action step runs maven to execute testcontainers tests\r\n\r\npros:\r\n * docker steps use official action\r\n * don't need to use a 3rd party maven plugin for docker\r\ncons:\r\n * IDE has no link from source built to image built (refactoring etc)\r\n * it is strange to explain that docker build runs the same build internally, then later we run maven externally to test that image\r\n\r\nI'm missing pros and cons on either but trying to spike some rationale. definitely I think the latter feels very weird to me, basically the inception part of docker running maven then for maven to run tests on the docker image","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/695779607/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/695788162","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/3212#issuecomment-695788162","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/3212","id":695788162,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5NTc4ODE2Mg==","user":{"login":"anuraaga","id":198344,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5ODM0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/198344?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga","html_url":"https://github.com/anuraaga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-20T13:36:37Z","updated_at":"2020-09-20T13:36:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ah maven plugin would let the tests build the images in IDE too -

for the continued effort and design work here, @tacigar. Great stuff! In a lot of ways, I like this much more. I worry, though, if we don't make it clear that the pie chart is showing span count, users will think it is a representation of relative duration. Even if we tried to make it clear, I worry if users will still jump to that conclusion. Likewise, the table with the span count almost aligns with the duration column from the search results, which again might lead people to think it is a duration value. I wonder if we need both the pie chart and the table, since the names of the services are clearly visible on the pie chart.
