Should not use `threadlocal` to handle `ShardingConnection`, it will cause the code hard to understand, and may cause multiple threads problems.\r\n2. Class `MySQLNowExpressionCovertExtractor` is in sharding-jdbc component, how to deal with sharding-proxy if they need use this feature too?\r\n3. `MySQLNowExpressionCovertExtractor` should be in parse module. Right now, it is in jdbc module. This module is for access endpoint only, we should not add parse and sharding logics here.\r\n4. use `ShardingConnection` in `MySQLNowExpressionCovertExtractor` is unacceptable, because the parse module is a lower layer which should not aware any upper layers, the module dependency is revert here.\r\n5. I notice this pr add some new SPI in parse layer that is not same abstract level with original parse SPI, it will make user confuse, any SPI added should fully discuss first.\r\n\r\nBecause the design

@terrymanu, I have communicated with Apollo team, they think read config and modify config design for different roles, so they split the Apollo API.\r\n\r\nFor read config API design for application system, it is high availability, and it is not any limit.\r\n\r\nBut for modify config API design for other config system to sync configuration to Apollo, it need token validation and must have modify config rights, they think modify config must be very careful, if operate error, it make a mistake for application system.\r\n\r\nSo they split the Apollo API. \r\n`apollo-client` is for application system，it provide read config API and monitor config change API;\r\n`apollo-openapi` is for other config system, it provide read config API and modify config API.\r\n\r\nThis is the discuss issue: https://github.com/ctripcorp/apollo/issues/2635\r\n\r\nIn ShardingSphere `org.apache.shardingsphere.orchestration.config.api.ConfigCenter` interface have read and modify API.
