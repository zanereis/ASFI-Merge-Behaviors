you @yhuai for reviewing this. \nThe motivation I create this PR is currently the table will be created in logical plan analyzing (see `object CreateTables`) for CTAS, which may causes some side effect / bugs.\n\nFor example in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1847, I was trying to \"explain\" the CTAS like `explain create table abc as select * from src`. And probably the same in some case when developers debug their logical plan before real execution.\n\n I think we'd better move the table creation from logical plan analyzing to executing. So I created a new Physical Operator `CreateTableAsSelect`\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51735809/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51736429","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1851#issuecomment-51736429","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1851","id":51736429,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNzM2NDI5","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-11T02:20:29Z","updated_at":"2014-08-11T02:20:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA results for PR 1851:<br>\\- This patch PASSES unit tests.<br>\\- This patch merges cleanly<br>\\- This patch adds no public classes<br><br>For more information see test ouptut:<br>https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/SparkPullRequestBuilder/18293/consoleFull\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51736429/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51736839","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1875#issuecomment-51736839","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1875","id":51736839,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNzM2ODM5","user":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-11T02:30:54Z","updated_at":"2014-08-11T02:30:54Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@mateiz, thanks for the attention.

Below are some ideas to make in-memory columnar store more memory efficient, and can be done in separate PRs based on this one.\n\nWhile building column buffers in batch, we still uses 1MB as initial column buffer size for _each_ column (defined as `ColumnBuilder.DEFAULT_INITIAL_BUFFER_SIZE`). Say `T` tasks are running in parallel to squeeze a table with `C` columns into memory, we allocate at least `T * C * 1MB` for each batch.\n\nThe initial column buffer size estimation used in Shark can be useful, but unfortunately the implementation is actually buggy, and usually gives fairly small initial buffer size. A more reasonable estimation heuristics could be:\n1. Let `D[i]` be the default size of the `i`-th column\n2. Let `I = sum(D[i]) * batchSize`\n3. Default column buffer size for the `i`-th column is `S[i] = I * D[i] / sum(D[i])`\n\nThis estimation is precise for all primitive types whose default sizes equals to their actual sizes since the row number (i.e. `batchSize`) in a batch is known.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51737798/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51737908","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1881#issuecomment-51737908","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1881","id":51737908,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNzM3OTA4","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-11T02:58:51Z","updated_at":"2014-08-11T02:58:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA results for PR 1881:<br>\\- This patch PASSES unit tests.<br>\\- This patch merges cleanly<br>\\- This patch adds no public classes<br><br>For more information see test ouptut:<br>https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/SparkPullRequestBuilder/18294/consoleFull\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51737908/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51737939","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1883#issuecomment-51737939","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1883","id":51737939,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNzM3OTM5","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-11T02:59:42Z","updated_at":"2014-08-11T02:59:42Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA tests have started for PR 1883.

While you are right that this is less `deterministic`, its not clear to me that it is desirable to have a compiler that deterministically allows you to write programs that don't line up with the schema of the data.  If the schema changes and my program is now invalid, I want the compilation to fail!\n\nAnother note: this is not intended as the only interface to Spark SQL, and I think we should plan to support the less magical interface long term for cases where determining the schema at compile time is not feasible.\n\nFinally, I think the time when this functionality will be the most useful is in the interactive Spark Shell.
