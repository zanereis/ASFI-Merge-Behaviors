Can you give me an example to understand the difference on how resources will be used on the two projects?\r\n\r\nHi @pvillard31, thanks for your reply, the major purpose is that, when creating a job to load data of a project into BigQuery, this job will use the resources of the project. In most cases, a project can have data in BigQuery dataset and its limited resources for loading job. But in our cases, we split GCP projects into two layers for security control, data project and resource project: \r\n* Data project can only store data and provide data access, it doesn't have any resources to create any jobs. \r\n* Resource project is used to create jobs, users can only create job by resource projects instead of data project. \r\n\r\nThat's the reason why we needs to config two project ID for BigQuery processors, the designate project ID is used to specify the target project to store data, and the other project ID is to specify the resource project.

I think it makes a lot of sense to add in a Status Message property. Setting the flowfile content is often what we want for a \"200 OK\" type of response but this makes a lot of sense for other scenarios. The only thing that I'm not sure about is the idea of having this processor update the FlowFile content. I think it makes more sense to send back the use-configured response but not change the FlowFile. I can definitely see cases where we will want to receive an HTTP message, do something with it, then send back a response, and afterwards continue with the FlowFile to do something else. And in the case that we don't want to do anything and want to terminate the flow after HandleHttpResponse, there's no benefit to the overhead of updating FlowFile content.\r\n\r\nSo it seems to me that we should instead not have the processor update the FlowFile's content at all.

you @markap14 for the review and suggestion. Definitely, it make lot of sense to not write to a flowfile when HandleHttpResponse is not terminated and if the previous content is needed. Also, it will add additional overhead of overwriting when HandleHttpResponse is terminated like you mentioned. Instead, we can send status message to `response.getOutputStream()` when `Http Status Message` property is set otherwise follow existing step of exporting flowfile content to response.getOutputStream()\r\n\r\n``` \r\n// if statusMessage property is set\r\nif (!StringUtils.isBlank(statusMessage)) {\r\n   try(OutputStream out = response.getOutputStream();) {\r\n        out.write(statusMessage.getBytes());\r\n   }\r\n} else {\r\n   session.export(flowfile, response.getOutputStream());\r\n}\r\n```   \r\n\r\nThis will also be beneficial to send different response back when failed and further continue to process the failure such as sending email or writing the failed content somewhere. It will also avoid using Processors like ReplaceText (for writing failure response message) and ExtractText for example ( to restore back our previous content if we want to continue further processing if HandleHttpResponse is not terminated) specifically on failures. \r\n\r\n**Example**\r\n\r\nExisting approach\r\n` HandleHttpRequest -> ... ExtractText -> ReplaceText --> HandleHttpResponse -> (restore back content for further processing from ExtractText)`\r\n\r\nWhen Status Message property is set\r\n ` HandleHttpRequest -> ....... --> HandleHttpResponse (set status message) -> (continue rest of the processing)`\r\n\r\n Please suggest if this looks.

These are transitive dependencies in hive-hcatalog-streaming, and version 1.6.0 appears to be the latest version for the dependency coordinates of org.apache.calcite:calcite-avatica.  I see a more recent version of 1.18.0 as you noted, but the Maven coordinates are different.  Unfortunately these Hive components have a number of very old dependencies, which makes management difficult.  The goal of this current PR is to update transitive dependencies enough to avoid third-party repositories, but in the long run, removing these legacy Hive components is probably the best way to go.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/858590044/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/858640308","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5105#issuecomment-858640308","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5105","id":858640308,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg1ODY0MDMwOA==","user":{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-10T13:50:20Z","updated_at":"2021-06-10T13:59:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@naddym yes that is exactly what I had in mind.\r\nOne other interesting note to consider: Your check above:\r\n`if (!StringUtils.isBlank(statusMessage)) {` may not be exactly correct, because the status message may be an empty string, and if I'm not mistaken that is perfectly valid.

I had to type in the IP address or 0.0.0.0.\r\nSo the property name address seems to correspond to an actual ip address. If the property name was host I will assume it would be a fqdn.\r\nIf I have multiple network interfaces on my nodes, I would select one interface (ip address) to be the network for load balance and another for the remote access UI and S2S.\r\nUsing fqdn as host property will not provide you the possibility to select a different network for internal load balance between nodes. Therefore I will go for the address property and specified that it has to be an ip address\r\nKind Regards\r\nJens M.

I think took a look at the UI and played with it some. I can see some benefit in the ability to show/hide the grid. And I do like that the grid changes size as the user zooms in and out.\r\n\r\nHowever, I find it a bit disorienting with the current sizes of the gridlines. They are quite a lot smaller than the old gridlines. It also means that with this update, all of the images in the User Guide, etc. all of our documentation are now out of date. I think it makes more sense to keep the size of the grid so that the gridlines are the same as they were before when zoomed into a 1:1 ratio (i.e., when you click the \"Actual\" button on the Navigate panel).\r\n\r\nI'm also not really qualified to review the UI portion, as I have little experience with JavaScript / CSS so I'd like to see a committer who's done a lot of UI work review the UI code as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/860792823/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/860910396","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5155#issuecomment-860910396","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5155","id":860910396,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2MDkxMDM5Ng==","user":{"login":"thenatog","id":38888042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg4MDQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38888042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog","html_url":"https://github.com/thenatog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-14T18:45:38Z","updated_at":"2021-06-14T18:45:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Reviewing..","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/860910396/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/860957741","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5155#issuecomment-860957741","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5155","id":860957741,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2MDk1Nzc0MQ==","user":{"login":"thenatog","id":38888042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg4MDQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38888042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog","html_url":"https://github.com/thenatog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-14T20:05:33Z","updated_at":"2021-06-14T20:05:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Tested
