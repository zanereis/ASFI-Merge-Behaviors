I found how I can do it today. But I had a number of questions. Is it enough to run the command: ant test?\r\n\r\nThere are many kind of tests, ranging from unit tests to functional tests. Post a question in the mailing list to get some guidance, or consult the tutorials.\r\n\r\nNote that the comments I've added are only those I found in a quick review.  You're expected to review **all of the rest of changes** in these few hundred files, and make sure that:\r\n\r\n* you're not changing APIs/SPIs, \r\n* that all form you're changing can be opened in the IDE (this is, that Java code is in sync with the corresponding form and Bundle files).\r\n* that all tests pass in the affected modules.\r\n* that you can run the IDE (`ant tryme`) and that the forms that you've changed are working properly (this is, that no exception is thrown making the IDE or the form unusable).\r\n\r\nOnce you've done all these changes and tests then:\r\n\r\n* squash the commits (`git rebase -i` may be of help) \r\n* and then force push to this same branch (`git push -f`). \r\n* Then ask for another review again.\r\n\r\nWe expect you're focused in this PR, making it pristine for our review, and that you won't open any other new PRs that do not match these quality criteria.\r\n\r\nThe goal of all this work is to have a new version of NetBeans that behaves **exactly the same** for end users (because users won't notice that you have renamed internal variables, because you have made sure that all tests work, and because you have made sure that forms don't break).\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1454858767/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1454868267","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/5605#issuecomment-1454868267","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5605","id":1454868267,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5Wt4cr","user":{"login":"vieiro","id":564140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NDE0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/564140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro","html_url":"https://github.com/vieiro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-04T20:38:51Z","updated_at":"2023-03-04T20:38:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi,

my original plan was to mark the changes in the screenshot. But after taking so many it would have been too much work using gimp. The second idea was to use the `mouseover` feature of the img tag to switch between images on hover, but github doesn't support it either.\r\n\r\nSo the easiest way to see the difference is to download the zip, open an image with a viewer tool and quickly toggle with the  arrow keys between before/after. Some changes only make sense in context, e.g if you switch between tabs in the UI.\r\n\r\nLooking at the linked issue can also help to know what to look for.\r\n\r\n@eirikbakke the UI snapshot feature of the debugging session was vital to find where stuff is implemented. It allows to jump directly to the implementation. Although some layout issues were super sneaky, e.g some code somewhere else adding a empty border with insets to patch something, or even worse: code replacing components, borders or even layout managers outside of the actual component code.\r\n\r\nthanks everyone for review.
