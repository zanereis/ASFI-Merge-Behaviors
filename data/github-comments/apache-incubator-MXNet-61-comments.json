Who can give me some help, I m very grateful. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/206426143/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/206427060","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/1799#issuecomment-206427060","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1799","id":206427060,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNjQyNzA2MA==","user":{"login":"GrindstoneLZX","id":18130064,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTMwMDY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18130064?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrindstoneLZX","html_url":"https://github.com/GrindstoneLZX","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrindstoneLZX/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrindstoneLZX/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrindstoneLZX/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrindstoneLZX/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrindstoneLZX/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrindstoneLZX/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrindstoneLZX/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrindstoneLZX/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrindstoneLZX/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-06T15:26:47Z","updated_at":"2016-04-06T15:26:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"![memory usage](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/18130064/14322317/f385cc32-fc4e-11e5-9924-b35917539dfb.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/206427060/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/206432817","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/1799#issuecomment-206432817","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1799","id":206432817,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNjQzMjgxNw==","user":{"login":"pluskid","id":3542,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3542?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid","html_url":"https://github.com/pluskid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-06T15:35:38Z","updated_at":"2016-04-06T15:35:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@GrindstoneLZX The memory should already been shared across buckets -- essentially, the total memory consumption should be equal to the largest bucket (e.g. the longest sequence).

My dataset is a speech dataset with 4620 utterances, and the frame number (sequence length) of each utterance ranges from 54 to 487. I set buckets in a way that the number of utterances is roughly equal in each bucket. For example:\n\n| bucket[0] | bucket[1] | bucket[2] | ... | bucket[N-2] | bucket[N-1] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 89 | 126 | 178 | ... | 321 | 487 |\n\nthe default_bucket_key of my DataIter is **bucket[0]**. During training, first I select one bucket and then select several utterances as one mini-batch. If the mini-batch is not full, I will fill it with zeros. I have tried two different way to select buckets. \nThe result I reported yesterday is the selecting buckets in an ascending order, which is **89, 126, 178, ... , 321, 487**. \n\nAnd I also tried descending order, which is **487, 321, ..., 178, 126, 89**. The result is:\n\n| GPU memory (MB) | parallel_num = 25 | parallel_num = 40 | parallel_num = 60 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| bucket_num = 10 | 3321 | 5454 | 7080 |\n| bucket_num = 20 | 3638 | 5945 | 7846 |\n| bucket_num = 50 | 3568 | 5881 | 7699 |\n| bucket_num = 70 | 3553 | 5774 | 7658 |\n| bucket_num = 100 | 3537 | 5728 | 7626 |\n\n![memory usage

default_bucket_key to buckets[N-1] to pre-allocate maximum memory space, but when I set default_bucket_key = buckets[N-1], I get an error:\n\n2016-04-07 11:49:12,823 Start training with

Thank you very much for your suggestion. \nTwo remaining question: \nI notice that `req` array is always `kWriteTo`. How can I modify it?\nAnd will mxnet add both the gradients from `tensor_1` and `tensor_2` as a default behaviour if I do not use `BlockGrad`?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/206848888/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/206952766","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/1802#issuecomment-206952766","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1802","id":206952766,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNjk1Mjc2Ng==","user":{"login":"pluskid","id":3542,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3542?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid","html_url":"https://github.com/pluskid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-07T15:27:43Z","updated_at":"2016-04-07T15:28:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Not sure why it got compiled with `-fopenmp` even though you disabled it in `config.mk`.
