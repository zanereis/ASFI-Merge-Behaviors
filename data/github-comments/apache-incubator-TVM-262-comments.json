instrumentation point - takes \\p Pass instance to be executed\r\n  /// and constant reference to IR it operates on. \\Returns true if pass is\r\n  /// allowed to be executed. These are only run on optional pass since required\r\n  /// passes must always be run. This allows these callbacks to print info when\r\n  /// they want to skip a pass.\r\n  template <typename IRUnitT, typename PassT>\r\n  bool runBeforePass(const PassT &Pass, const IRUnitT &IR) const {\r\n    if (!Callbacks)\r\n      return true;\r\n\r\n    bool ShouldRun = true;\r\n    if (!isRequired(Pass)) {\r\n      for (auto &C : Callbacks->ShouldRunOptionalPassCallbacks)\r\n        ShouldRun &= C(Pass.name(), llvm::Any(&IR));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    if (ShouldRun) {\r\n      for (auto &C : Callbacks->BeforeNonSkippedPassCallbacks)\r\n        C(Pass.name(), llvm::Any(&IR));\r\n    } else {\r\n

Is `MangleExternalFunction` better? Because I am only mangling the functions that will be offloaded to the external compiler\r\n* `run_func`: is it ok for everyone if I use only `run`?

I have a few concerns for this approach though:\r\n> \r\n> 1. IMO, we should emphasize this python API strictly for user prototyping and not for any checked in  code, since the type function exposed through FFI is not the C++ type relation (it's strictly weaker since we don't have access to the type reporter, and cannot propagate constraints to the inputs, only to the output). We should probably not use \"type relation\" to describe the python API but I'm not sure what other name to use.\r\n\r\nSince we still call C++ type relation funcs underhood（such as test_custom_op_infer）, I keep the name but add more comments in python api, is it ok?\r\n\r\n> 2. Related to the previous point, the python API (at least currently) does not have access to diagnostics for reporting type errors, which is not good for user experience (indeed we're trying to port ICHECKs to diagnostics where possible).\r\n> \r\n\r\nLet me try add a case for python exceptions.\r\n\r\n> Ideally we should expose all the machinery needed but for prototyping it might not be necessary. cc @jroesch for thoughts\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/847617680/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/847714999","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8079#issuecomment-847714999","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8079","id":847714999,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0NzcxNDk5OQ==","user":{"login":"xqdan","id":23742050,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNzQyMDUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23742050?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xqdan","html_url":"https://github.com/xqdan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xqdan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xqdan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xqdan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xqdan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xqdan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xqdan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xqdan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xqdan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xqdan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-25T09:34:14Z","updated_at":"2021-05-25T09:34:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@altanh

We found an issue in the storage rewrite pass. The problem is due to the fact that the packed functions accept TVMValues and not bare pointers. This means that in this TIR:\r\n ```\r\n   let sid_5_value_1: handle = @tir.tvm_stack_alloca(\"array\", 1, dtype=handle)\r\n    @tir.tvm_struct_set(sid_5_value_1, 0, 1, sid_5, dtype=handle)\r\n    let sid_4_value: handle = @tir.tvm_stack_alloca(\"array\", 1, dtype=handle)\r\n    @tir.tvm_struct_set(sid_4_value, 0, 1, sid_4, dtype=handle)\r\n     {\r\n      @tir.tvm_call_cpacked(\"fused_transpose\", sid_5_value_1, sid_4_value, dtype=int32)\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nThe rewriter is able to identify `sid_5_value_1` and `sid_4_value` as both live variables, and they are not overridden. But it fails to see that those variable relate to `sid_5` and `sid_4` (respectively).\r\n\r\nEarly on, in the  calls: \r\n```\r\n@tir.tvm_struct_set(sid_5_value_1, 0, 1, sid_5, dtype=handle)\r\n@tir.tvm_struct_set(sid_4_value, 0, 1, sid_4, dtype=handle)\r\n```\r\nThe variables `sid_5` and `sid_4` are treated as separate variables (that are NOT live at the same time) and hence get overridden. In the last commit I explicitly create a translation table between the TVMValues and the allocations. This seems to fix the issue.  I have added also a further test case `test_transpose` (disabling the op-fusion in Relay) to test this scenario.
