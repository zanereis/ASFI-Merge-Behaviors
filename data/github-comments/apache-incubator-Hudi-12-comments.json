I have revamped this PR and made few improvements. Here is the list:\r\n\r\n1. Reimplement docker files to reduce image sizes. I am seeing 3-4x improvements in docker sizes (from 4 - 5 GB to 0.8-1.5GB). \r\n2. I have published all the docker images to docker-hub (temporarily using my docker-hub account) so that there is no need to build the docker images as part of running the script. \r\n3. Made both docker images and compose follow convention so that a single image can satisfy both use-cases\r\n   (a) Standalone - Docker images that are published to Docker-hub have inbuilt hudi jars so that they are self-contained.\r\n  (b) Mounting Convention - The images allow for overriding those hudi jars with locally built jars allowing for the same setup to be used for running integ-testing against code-changes locally (look at the compose script and hoodie-integ/pom.xml)\r\n4.  Updates quickstart docs to reflect the changes above\r\n\r\nI have marked this PR as WIP since I need to showcase  incremental view as part of demo. \r\n\r\n@n3nash @sungjuly : Can you please follow the quickstart steps and let me know your experience. \r\nOur aim is to have an easy-to-use and hassle-free hudi quickstart.

: Couple of things: \r\n1. If you are trying to ingest data directly in Hudi format, the \"insert into\" hive query will not work. You should instead use the delta-streamer spark-tool (or HoodieWriteClient API) as described in the quickstart : https://uber.github.io/hudi/quickstart.html#a-demo-using-docker-containers \r\n2. But (1) should not be the reason why are not seeing any data. Hudi input format allows non-hoodie partitions to be queried. Looking at the table definition, Are you sure the Location attribute is set correctly. I can see atleast one inconsistency - The table definition has location set as /user/hoodie-test wheres the hadoop fs queries points to /user/bdp/hoodie-test/...  Also, can you ensure the defaultFS is set to hdfs and not local fs. You can inspect the output of \"desc formatted <table_name>\" ?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/427898371/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/427925087","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/480#issuecomment-427925087","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/480","id":427925087,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNzkyNTA4Nw==","user":{"login":"AnkitMishra3220","id":40383808,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzgzODA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40383808?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnkitMishra3220","html_url":"https://github.com/AnkitMishra3220","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnkitMishra3220/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnkitMishra3220/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnkitMishra3220/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnkitMishra3220/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnkitMishra3220/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnkitMishra3220/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnkitMishra3220/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnkitMishra3220/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnkitMishra3220/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-08T17:57:10Z","updated_at":"2018-10-08T18:01:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hello @bvaradar,\r\n\r\nThanks for your quick response !!\r\n\r\nI have seen location attribute is set correctly.

:\r\n\r\n\"My use case is to optimize existing Hive table in which data is getting ingested from informatica jobs.\"\r\n      We have a pending PR which details how to migrate existing tables to Hoodie. Here is the link : https://github.com/uber/hudi/blob/fda78e40ad6c0e18015610e5403858fea06a9634/docs/migration_guide.md\r\n     Let me know if you have more question around this. We will be happy to help you.\r\n\r\n\"Do I have to use 'HoodieWriteClient API' to ingest the data into Hoodie table ?\"\r\n  Hoodie ingestion path requires using a spark job to incrementally ingest data to the data-set. \r\n  As you can notice from the quickstart ( here : https://uber.github.io/hudi/quickstart.html#step-2-incrementally-ingest-data-from-kafka-topic), we have a ready-to-use Spark tool - HoodieDeltaStreamer to ingest data. This supports ingesting from common data-sources like kafka.\r\n  This tool uses HoodieWriteClient API to ingest data.  If you have a different (custom) data-source, you can directly use HoodieWriteClient API to ingest (Take a look at DeltaStreamer source to understand how this is done).\r\n  The read-path is supported by both Hive and Spark.\r\n\r\n\"Do I have to follow some more steps to setup Hoodie Hive environment in my CDH cluster ?\"\r\n We had revamped the quickstart to include a demo. Not sure if you got a chance to look at the latest version of quickstart ( https://uber.github.io/hudi/quickstart.html ). From your hive console dump, it looks like you are not using the correct jar. The quickstart should give you the context.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/428011693/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/428378899","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/481#issuecomment-428378899","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/481","id":428378899,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyODM3ODg5OQ==","user":{"login":"bvaradar","id":3021376,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMjEzNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3021376?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar","html_url":"https://github.com/bvaradar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-09T22:45:54Z","updated_at":"2018-10-09T22:45:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@n3nash : Please review and let @vinothchandar know if the PR looks good.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/428378899/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/429073531","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/482#issuecomment-429073531","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/482","id":429073531,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyOTA3MzUzMQ==","user":{"login":"bvaradar","id":3021376,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMjEzNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3021376?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar","html_url":"https://github.com/bvaradar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-11T18:41:43Z","updated_at":"2018-10-11T18:41:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@vinothchandar @n3nash : This is higher priority than my other PRs.

Would this help with your usecase? \r\n\r\nOr do you need source as raw parquet files? I vaguely remember discussing an alternate solution for use case with someone on slack (not sure if its @cb149) .. Let's assume you are currently reading from source system X (which may be kafka, kinesis..) and writing out parquet. Instead of reading these parquet files and writing using deltastreamer (your ask in this issue), could be just have deltastreamer read from X directly and write a hoodie dataset? Then, it also becomes easy to compare the two datasets (plain parquet and hoodie) head-head for freshness, correctness etc.. \r\n\r\nif above don't suffice, yes.
