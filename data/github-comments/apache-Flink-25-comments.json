A KeySelector<X,Y> transparently converts a `DataSet<X>` into a `DataSet<Tuple2<Y,X>` and uses the first tuple field as key. Since the KeySelector used here is an IdentityKeySelector we end up with a `DataSet<X,X>` which unnecessarily doubles the amount of data. \n\nI will look at this PR later in detail and give some feedback how it could be improved.

Take a look at the `BlobServer` and its `shutdown()` method for an example of how to do this robustly.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/90903241/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/90921879","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/202#issuecomment-90921879","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/202","id":90921879,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDkwOTIxODc5","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-08T13:46:17Z","updated_at":"2015-04-08T13:46:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The timeout measures how long java or python are stuck in a blocking udp operation. this generally means how long it takes for the python side to compute one chunk of data. the java side sends a chunk, and then waits for the next signal. if this takes too long, timeout. it's quite fickle to be honest, and without a regular heartbeat one can always construct scenarios where it will break the job.\n\ni _think_ tcp would cover it.\n\nthanks for the hint to remove the shutdown hook, addressed.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/90921879/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/90936379","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/579#issuecomment-90936379","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/579","id":90936379,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDkwOTM2Mzc5","user":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-08T14:41:39Z","updated_at":"2015-04-08T14:41:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi Faye, I made some annotations.

is an interesting idea to collect back a data stream. This solution here has, however, quite a few limitations and implications (I assume it was only locally tested?):\n- It supports only `java.io.Serializable` types. This is a bit inconsistent with the current type handling and serialization in Flink. Some types that work in all other parts do not work here.\n- It does not work in a cluster. It sends \"localhost\" as the name to the worker who should send the data back. In any non-local setup, this cannot work.\n- It requires the worker to be able to connect to the client. This may be tricky, when the client and workers do not run both in the cluster.\n- Selecting the proper interface that opens the port for data communication is actually quite tricky. The TaskManagers spend quite a bit of work to select that interface - otherwise many installations do not work, since in most cases certain interfaces or hostnames are only accessible from certain networks (cloud internal and external network interfaces).\n\nI think this is a very tricky thing to realize. It has implications on the distributed process and communication model. It starts extending streaming to mixed local/remote runtimes and everything. It affects all assumptions we make for fault tolerance. What happens to the stream in case of a failure? There is no notion of restarting the driver.\n\nThat is something that needs a bit more consideration and design, for the sake of building something consistent where the concepts and implications play together well. I hope you do not take it the wrong way, but without clarifying these points, this addition is a bit premature. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/90987769/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/91048962","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/547#issuecomment-91048962","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/547","id":91048962,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDkxMDQ4OTYy","user":{"login":"vasia","id":498957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5ODk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/498957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia","html_url":"https://github.com/vasia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-08T22:00:50Z","updated_at":"2015-04-08T22:00:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks so much for the review @fhueske, @StephanEwen!\nI'll make the suggested changes and merge :-)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/91048962/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/91082306","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/581#issuecomment-91082306","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/581","id":91082306,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDkxMDgyMzA2","user":{"login":"mbalassi","id":5990983,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5OTA5ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5990983?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi","html_url":"https://github.com/mbalassi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-09T01:05:00Z","updated_at":"2015-04-09T01:05:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for picking up the issue, @ggevay.

One of the goals is to support resume/recovery of a job from an intermediate result already produced. Another goal is to rework the deploy logic of the `ExecutionGraph` to schedule tasks in a more optimal way instead of merely deploying them from the source.\n\nThe changes in this pull request are a first step towards these goals. The `scheduleUsingBacktracking` method backtracks from the sinks to the sources while checking for available `IntermediateResultPartitions`. This can already be used if you replace the `ScheduleMode` in `ExecutionGraph` to `ScheduleMod.BACKTRACKING`. In a next commit, proper locking of the intermediate results and resume will be supported.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/93265798/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/93270919","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/594#issuecomment-93270919","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/594","id":93270919,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDkzMjcwOTE5","user":{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-15T08:59:06Z","updated_at":"2015-04-15T08:59:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1
