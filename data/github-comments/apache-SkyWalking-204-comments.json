That's why I want a \"client side\" sampling. I'm not very sure of this behavior so please correct me if this is not the fact.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, the so-called service-side `samplingRate` has nothing about transportation, no matter for gRPC or Kafka. This is not related.\r\n\r\n> The sample n in 3 seconds client config works for us, but a percentage one would be easier to reason about when specifying this option since different topics may have different messages per seconds, in which case a percentage sampling rate seems more suitable\r\n\r\nI think you have a misunderstanding about the sampling. It is not just for the network, sampling at the client side is for reducing the whole agent load, including tracing context, header injection/extraction, span creation/operations, etc. are all not working if not sampling. \r\nKafka reporter is just a pluggable and optional thing. No core-level mechanism related to it. \r\n\r\n___\r\nThe key of all these things, SkyWalking is targeting the APM, rather than just tracing. So, metrics and topology really matter. Any sampling mechanism at the client side would have a side-effect on this. We can't have a clear scenario about sampling rate(client-side) is better than the current one.\r\n\r\nOur final agenda is using `on building` [SkyWalking Satellite](https://github.com/apache/skywalking-satellite), which could be deployed as a sidecar, so no network cost. Then it will analyze the traces to get metrics(we call those **sources**) and forward to the OAP.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/743725407/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/743726544","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/5998#issuecomment-743726544","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/5998","id":743726544,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0MzcyNjU0NA==","user":{"login":"codecov[bot]","id":22429695,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjI0Mjk2OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/254?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/codecov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-12T08:58:55Z","updated_at":"2020-12-12T11:24:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#

And ensure that when creating a new project through the `generator.sh`, a tag like  `<sourceDirectory>new-scenario-name<sourceDirectory>` will be added in `test/plugin/pom.xml`.\r\n2. make `scenarios` to be a maven project and make all projects in its folder become its subprojects\r\nlike method one, I also can modify the  `generator.sh`.\r\nWhich method would be

is not related to the trace. I think they are all traced, but 'T4CPreparedStatement' and 'OraclePreparedStatement' should be filtered out, because they weren't enhanced by 'correct' purpose.\r\n\r\nFrom ConnectionInstrumentation class in Oracle Plugin , I saw it does enhance PhysicalConnection,T4CConnection and intercept prepareStatement method. \r\nAs my preceding post , OraclePreparedStatementWrapper is the return value of 'prepareStatement' method in PhysicalConnection which was already enhanced in ConnectionInstrumentation.  Below is the method name in PhysicalConnection:\r\npublic synchronized PreparedStatement prepareStatement(String paramString, Properties paramProperties) throws SQLException\r\n\r\nSo , i guess OraclePreparedStatementWrapper was set StatementEnhanceInfos when the code intercept 'prepareStatement' method of PhysicalConnection. \r\n\r\nAbout the question why 'T4CPreparedStatement' and 'OraclePreparedStatement' are not enhanced.  \r\n'T4CPreparedStatement' and 'OraclePreparedStatement' were actually enhanced. That's why they still can be intercepted by 'JDBCPreparedStatementSetterInterceptor.beforeMethod'. But they were intercepted by setString interceptor of ' T4CPreparedStatement, OraclePreparedStatementWrapper and OraclePreparedStatement' in 'OraclePrepareStatementInstrumentation' rather than 'PhysicalConnection.prepareStatement' , so they didn't inject StatementEnhanceInfos . That's the cause of NPE.\r\n\r\nThat's my opinion.\r\nPlease let me know if you have any concerns.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/745054369/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/745062096","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/6007#issuecomment-745062096","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/6007","id":745062096,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0NTA2MjA5Ng==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-15T05:29:10Z","updated_at":"2020-12-15T05:29:10Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The current change is ignoring to collect the parameters.Is that right?
