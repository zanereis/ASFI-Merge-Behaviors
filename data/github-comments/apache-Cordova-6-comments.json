However, [the MDN guide on modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules#Other_differences_between_modules_and_standard_scripts) states that:\r\n> You need to pay attention to local testing — if you try to load the HTML file locally (i.e. with a `file://` URL), you'll run into CORS errors due to JavaScript module security requirements. You need to do your testing through a server.\r\n\r\nYou can also go ahead and try to open the minimal reproduction that @jamcoupe posted (thanks, by the way) directly from the file system with Chrome. It will give a `net::ERR_FAILED` when trying to load the script with `type=\"module\"`. Since the Android WebView is Chrome, there's little we can do about this issue.\r\n\r\nThat means, that configuring your build to not use `type=\"module\"` is the correct solution here.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/550289662/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/551878612","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cordova/issues/170#issuecomment-551878612","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/170","id":551878612,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MTg3ODYxMg==","user":{"login":"CatchABus","id":55595100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTk1MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55595100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CatchABus","html_url":"https://github.com/CatchABus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CatchABus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CatchABus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CatchABus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CatchABus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CatchABus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CatchABus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CatchABus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CatchABus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CatchABus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-08T15:46:03Z","updated_at":"2019-11-08T15:46:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Looks

I think it would be good if someone would have a chance to do a more thorough review of the documentation for both accuracy and clarity.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/568223314/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/569418962","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cordova/issues/184#issuecomment-569418962","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/184","id":569418962,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2OTQxODk2Mg==","user":{"login":"breautek","id":11200662,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjAwNjYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11200662?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek","html_url":"https://github.com/breautek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-28T13:50:18Z","updated_at":"2019-12-28T13:50:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"To be clear, this isn't a domain, it is a reverse dns notation.

I would make an exception for console which is very basic universal functionality.\r\n\r\nThe whitelist functionality seems to be a challenging beast since it evidently works differently on Android, iOS, and maybe some other platforms. It would be ideal if we could find a way to abstract it somehow. And the newer iOS WKWebView seems to make this even worse.\r\n\r\nI would personally not really mind if the functionality of some of our core plugins would eventually be superseded by some third-party plugins that some members are involved with to a certain extent. For example:\r\n\r\n- Ionic WKWebView\r\n- https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/cordova-plugin-safariviewcontroller - provides some specific improvements over the InAppBrowser on iOS and Android, though with some major limitations\r\n- SQLite storage plugin - Android implementation was originally extracted from PhoneGap 1.x\r\n\r\nI am fine if we split some of the tasks into separate issues, would like to see the list of deprecated plugins in a pinned issue to help give the user community plenty of warning and opportunity to comment.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/569981196/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/570572438","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cordova/issues/188#issuecomment-570572438","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/188","id":570572438,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MDU3MjQzOA==","user":{"login":"timbru31","id":838003,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzODAwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/838003?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timbru31","html_url":"https://github.com/timbru31","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timbru31/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timbru31/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timbru31/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timbru31/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timbru31/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timbru31/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timbru31/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timbru31/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timbru31/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-03T13:31:05Z","updated_at":"2020-01-03T13:31:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I'm closing this issue and re-quote what the template said:\r\n\r\nApache Cordova uses GitHub Issues as a feature request and bug tracker _only_.\r\nFor usage and support questions, please check out the resources below.

be clear I presume you are only suggesting sunsetting when newer versions of plugins are available aka close-to drop in replacement plugins? \r\n\r\nOften new webAPIs that have core plugin functionality fully supported but cannot alone do the extended things some of those listed plugins can. At least not without months of work all told, or a huge amount of additional build out and refactor (maybe enough to kill businesses) which could honestly accompany this decision on next Cordova upgrade cycle, when these would all possibly become unusable. If for some reason (there often are) projects forced into an upgrade cycle and they find half their app no longer functions.\r\n\r\nThe whole model of Cordova was and is plugin extendability. Certainly hasn't been easy doing so with the complexity of version control, maintainers falling off, conflicts, etc. However, these are all critical plugins for many people who spent massive amounts of time and resources integrating them fully, and as mentioned the extended functionality and use cases in many of the listed plugins is critical to apps functioning correctly.\r\n\r\nWouldn't it make more sense seeing as Capacitor functions also on Cordova plugins, to promote upgrading and ongoing development of them by respective maintainers? Or suggesting the plugins reach out for some help and make the appropriate changes to be current? Users always have the option to opt for webAPIs anyway, so why not take that approach without actively promoting the depreciation of so many complex plugins.\r\n\r\nthe depreciation suggestion of these;\r\n apache/cordova-plugin-contacts\r\n apache/cordova-plugin-device-motion\r\n apache/cordova-plugin-device-orientation\r\n apache/cordova-plugin-file-transfer\r\napache/cordova-plugin-media\r\napache/cordova-plugin-media-capture\r\napache/cordova-plugin-camera\r\napache/cordova-plugin-file\r\nAll of which we use, seems like untold headaches.\r\nFor a small team that could potentially kill us. Took long enough to get all the plugins working correctly.\r\n\r\nWe also additionally use\r\nSplashscreen\r\nWhitelist\r\nbut personally we have no issue for those to be integrated, I've always felt that they should be.\r\n\r\nFurther we also use;\r\nWKwebview (Ionic version)\r\nWhitelist\r\nSQLite storage\r\nBut you have not suggested those to be depreciated, only to superseed core plugins.\r\n\r\nSo I guess I am trying to get a better understanding of how this depreciation is being approached without potentially devistating consequences for thousands of projects moving fwd. Maybe my understanding of stopping active support, development and matenaince on them is elevated due to knowing there is an enevitable dead end with this approach whereby the continuing advancement of the platform will eventually collide with their use at all, rending all the code surrounding each to be unusable. I know (and am grateful) that you maintain many plugins and for your work on Cordova proper. I personally feel if we all took one or two of them under our wings (with webAPI optionality) it's a better approach. Aren't plugin maintainers the ones to decide if they want to continue updating and maintenance on a plugin anyway? \r\n\r\nIn summary; sorry I'm not fully understanding your posts.

This would require significant changes on the native side of each platform.

It simply copies the files to the native app project that it manages for you. \r\n\r\nCordova can use a remote URL as it's content loading point, and the webserver can use gzip so perhaps this is what you were thinking about, but this is **NOT** the recommended approach for final deployments, as it can be a reason for app rejection from the app stores.\r\n\r\nDon't forget that, at least on android, APKs are already compressed (they are simply zip files afterall).

Please accept my apologies for not responding anytime sooner.\r\n\r\nOur Apache Cordova maintenance team is mostly if not 100% unpaid volunteers, generally with busy jobs in other companies or busy with freelance work. Volunteers with busy jobs cannot afford to either quit or go part-time, and freelancers like myself cannot afford to put too much work on hold. (I have made some sacrifices on my own in the past and do continue to give as much as I can to help keep maintenance going.) I think a major root cause is that 2 major companies had stopped sponsoring maintenance work.\r\n\r\nAs a member of Apache Cordova, it makes me extremely unhappy to see things such as:\r\n\r\n- issues and PRs sitting there with no response\r\n- bug fixes take too long to be published\r\n- Cordova falls too far behind platform API and SDK updates.\r\n\r\nDefinitely a stressful situation for myself and for others involved, including the user community.\r\n\r\nI am sure people can understand that the burden of supporting such a large number of old plugins would only add to the unfortunate amount of the existing stress.\r\n\r\nI think it would be ideal if we could see more and more plugins would be supported by user community members that we know, that we can keep documented, just like a number of plugins are famously supported by @EddyVerbruggen and SQLite storage is supported by myself.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/587600131/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/587601667","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cordova/issues/197#issuecomment-587601667","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/197","id":587601667,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NzYwMTY2Nw==","user":{"login":"brody4hire","id":1559888,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTk4ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1559888?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brody4hire","html_url":"https://github.com/brody4hire","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brody4hire/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brody4hire/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brody4hire/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brody4hire/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brody4hire/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brody4hire/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brody4hire/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brody4hire/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brody4hire/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-18T18:18:15Z","updated_at":"2020-02-18T18:18:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"We do not support issues with Ionic CLI.
