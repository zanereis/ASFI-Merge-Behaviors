0.11, when mxnet was built with CUDA enabled, OMP was not used for most operations in mxnet, even on CPU-only operations.  This changed in 0.12.\r\n\r\nIn 1.0, two additional things happened:\r\n  1) @piiswrong refactored broadcast operators from using the deprecated mshadow framework to his Kernel/Launch framework\r\n  2) Auto-tuning for selecting the most optimal OMP or non-OMP modes based upon thread count, number of data items and operator calculation \"weight\", thus using OMP for larger datasets and single-thread for smaller datasets (which is often faster).\r\n\r\nPost 1.0, IntelOMP is built and used by default for cmake builds.\r\n\r\nThese things together make mxnet faster than numpy for most broadcast ops (so far as I have seen so far).  Times I get for the above script:\r\n\r\nPASS 1...\r\n(1000, 10000)\r\navg time over 100 trials: 0.0125194501877s\r\n(1000, 10000)\r\navg time over 100 trials: 0.0115594983101s\r\nPASS 2...\r\n(1000, 10000)\r\navg time over 100 trials: 0.0119210195541s\r\n(1000, 10000)\r\navg time over 100 trials: 0.0114824414253s\r\n\r\nSo, I think that the issue is resolved in current builds.  To get similar performance in your 0.11, you'd probably need to build without CUDA enabled.  \r\n\r\nPlease reopen the issue if necessary.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/349507459/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/349509343","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/8219#issuecomment-349509343","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/8219","id":349509343,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0OTUwOTM0Mw==","user":{"login":"cjolivier01","id":11234557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjM0NTU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11234557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01","html_url":"https://github.com/cjolivier01","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-06T02:21:01Z","updated_at":"2017-12-06T02:21:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@aseyboldt Which code version?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/349509343/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/349509376","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/8219#issuecomment-349509376","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/8219","id":349509376,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0OTUwOTM3Ng==","user":{"login":"cjolivier01","id":11234557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjM0NTU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11234557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01","html_url":"https://github.com/cjolivier01","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-06T02:21:13Z","updated_at":"2017-12-06T02:21:30Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"By the way, I ran this script several times:\r\n```python\r\nimport mxnet as mx\r\nimport time\r\n\r\na = mx.sym.var('a')\r\nb = mx.sym.var('b')\r\n\r\na_ = mx.nd.ones((2**20,))\r\nb1 = mx.nd.ones((2**20,))\r\nb2 = mx.nd.ones((1,))\r\n\r\nfunc1 = (a + b).bind(mx.cpu(), {'a': a_, 'b': b1})\r\nfunc2 = mx.sym.broadcast_add(a, b).bind(mx.cpu(), {'a': a_, 'b': b2})\r\nfunc3 = (a + 1.).bind(mx.cpu(), {'a': a_})\r\n\r\nfor x in range(4):\r\n  print(\"PASS: {}...\", x)\r\n\r\n  # array + array\r\n  start = time.time()\r\n  for i in range(1000):\r\n    func1.forward()[0].wait_to_read()\r\n  print(\"func1: {}\".format(time.time() -

However, rewriting pslite only, without reconsidering data communication pattern like that in GDR or NCCL,  may lose opportunities of further optimization given that uppper-layer info is absent.\r\n\r\nI think here are some questions worth considering when designing RDMA-enable MXNet, hopefully getting some insights from MXNet community and byronyi.\r\n\r\n1.

Looking at the code I don't think so however.\r\n\r\nThe broadcasting `array + array` shouldn't be much slower than plain `array + array`, especially if one of the arrays is smaller than the other, as that helps a lot with the memory bandwidth. Memory bandwidth should be the limiting factor in simple ops on large arrays. This can be seen when we compare to numpy:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport os\r\nos.environ['OMP_NUM_THREADS'] = '1'\r\n\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport mxnet as mx\r\nimport time\r\n\r\na = mx.sym.var('a')\r\nb = mx.sym.var('b')\r\n\r\na_ = mx.nd.ones((2**17, 10, 10))\r\nb_ = mx.nd.ones((1,))\r\nc_ = a_.copy()\r\n\r\nx = a_.asnumpy()\r\ny = b_.asnumpy()\r\nz = c_.asnumpy()\r\n\r\nfunc1 = (a + b).bind(mx.cpu(), {'a': a_, 'b': c_})\r\nfunc2 = mx.sym.broadcast_add(a, b).bind(mx.cpu(), {'a': a_, 'b': b_})\r\n\r\nfor _ in range(2):\r\n    # elemwise\r\n    start = time.time()\r\n    for i in range(100):\r\n        func1.forward()[0].wait_to_read()\r\n    print(\"func1: {}\".format(time.time() - start))\r\n\r\n\r\n    # boadcast_add(array, array)\r\n    start = time.time()\r\n    for i in range(100):\r\n        func2.forward()[0].wait_to_read()\r\n    print(\"func2: {}\".format(time.time() - start))\r\n\r\n    # numpy elemwise\r\n    start = time.time()\r\n    out = np.zeros_like(x)\r\n    for i in range(100):\r\n        np.add(x, z, out=out)\r\n    print(\"numpy1: {}\".format(time.time() - start))\r\n    \r\n    # numpy broadcast\r\n    start = time.time()\r\n    for i in range(100):\r\n        np.add(x, y, out=out)\r\n    print(\"numpy2: {}\".format(time.time() - start))\r\n    \r\n    print()\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich gives me (different machine than the last benchmark)\r\n```\r\nfunc1: 0.9796142578125\r\nfunc2: 9.832738876342773\r\nnumpy1: 0.9367139339447021\r\nnumpy2: 0.6408178806304932\r\n\r\nfunc1: 0.927008867263794\r\nfunc2: 10.026437997817993\r\nnumpy1: 1.091845989227295\r\nnumpy2: 0.646554708480835\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor numpy the broadcasting op is *faster* than the normal one, for mxnet it is 10x slower.\r\n\r\nIn the non-broadcasting case both numpy and mxnet are bound by memory bandwidth, and this is still more or less the case in the broadcasting case for numpy, but not for mxnet. This seems to happen in general for the broadcasting ops in mxnet, not only when a scalar is added. (Although numpy can't use up all the memory bandwidth in some cases either, it never slows down nearly as much as mxnet)\r\n\r\nMy guess as to why func2 is so much slower than func1 is that the index juggling in `ravel` and `unravel` takes time and messes up prefetching. Other explanations could be that maybe some array is traversed in the wrong order (but I don't think this is the case) or that the branch because of `addto` slows things down (but I don't see how that would be a factor of 10).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/349621811/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/349700158","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/8955#issuecomment-349700158","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/8955","id":349700158,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0OTcwMDE1OA==","user":{"login":"fedorzh","id":5185993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxODU5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5185993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedorzh","html_url":"https://github.com/fedorzh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedorzh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedorzh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedorzh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedorzh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedorzh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedorzh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedorzh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedorzh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedorzh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-06T16:46:15Z","updated_at":"2017-12-06T16:47:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"If you take the old interface with mxnet.model, it can be pickled.\r\nTraining of the model is actually not the longest part of my pipeline (sometimes, adds an insignificant part), a lot of other numpy-based machinery is happening outside of it, and parallelization helps immensely with that -

I just want to double check that this is expected from your pov.  Would you be able to explain what's being described in this warning?  Are we really allocating a temporary dense ndarray when we call this operator?\r\n\r\n```\r\nStorage fallback detected:\r\noperator = Cast\r\ninput storage types = [row_sparse, ]\r\noutput storage types = [row_sparse, ]\r\nparams = {\"dtype\" : float16, }\r\ncontext.dev_mask = 1\r\nThe operator with default storage type will be dispatched for execution. You're seeing this warning message because the operator above is unable to process the given ndarrays with specified storage types and parameter. Temporary dense ndarrays are generated in order to execute the operator. You can set environment variable MXNET_STORAGE_FALLBACK_LOG_VERBOSE to 0 to suppress the warnings.\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample test run is here:
