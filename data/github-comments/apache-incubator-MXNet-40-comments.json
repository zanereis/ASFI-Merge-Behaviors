For example, suppose your `image.lst` file is like this:\n\n```\npath_to_img1 1\npath_to_img2 3\npath_to_img3 23\n...\n```\n\nYou could add another column to specify the number of labels.\n\n```\npath_to_img1 1 5\npath_to_img2 3 5\npath_to_img3 23 7\n...\n```\n\nWhen using `img2rec`, use `label_width=2` to read the
