我发现dubbo在异步调用的时候，使用future.get()的方式，会立刻进行一次判断是否isDone，虽然这个属于极端情况，但是个人不太建议这么干。\r\n原因一为了防止并发需要考虑加锁。\r\n原因二万一触发执行会占用执行线程触发业务逻辑，在很多netty+dubbo的场景下，执行线程很可能是netty的IO线程，导致有限的IO线程资源耗尽。\r\n我基于2.5.3版本修改了dubbo的异步工作模式，在context中新增了传入callback方法并在调用方使用netty的nio直接异步执行的方式。\r\npublic class RpcContext {\r\n    ......\r\n    // 新增回调传入\r\n    private ResponseCallback callback;\r\n    // 新增getset\r\n    ......\r\n}\r\n\r\n// 这里注释掉了对外暴露的future引用，个人认为没有必要，仅为个人意见【吐舌】\r\npublic class
