that's a great question -- I need to address that case because right now a task would put it up for retries forever. \n\nHowever, looking at the code, I think there's a larger bug here than just a logging message. In the current code, try_number never gets reset. That means tasks that are re-run (either by force or just because they failed) will not honor their own retry instructions. Their \"first\" run will already appear to be over the retry limit. In quick testing this can put the backfilljob into an infinite loop -- I need to see if #1220 is related. \n\nI'm going to mark this as a bug and add a unit test for retries with my next

You said \"I think you can use the TimeDeltaSensor operator for this\", what are you referring to? (The word \"this\" can refer to a few different things in the conversation.)\n\nThe original post was asking for a way to run tasks inside their scheduled \"period\", rather than after the period has ended (as is the current behavior). Are you saying that a negative TimeDeltaSensor would allow this?\n\nAbout the original post: I agree strongly. As a newcomer to Airflow the fact that tasks run after their period has ended has been my biggest source of confusion. As an Airflow user I am focused on creating tasks and DAGs, and it's confusing that the `start_date` is not the date that my DAGs will start running, but the day before. Is this the default behavior for legacy reasons, or do the Airflow authors believe this is the optimal behavior? Will the original suggestion in this thread ever be implemented? Would a PR to change this behavior be accepted?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/202420343/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/202488040","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1228#issuecomment-202488040","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1228","id":202488040,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwMjQ4ODA0MA==","user":{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-28T17:05:45Z","updated_at":"2016-03-28T17:06:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Nice!
