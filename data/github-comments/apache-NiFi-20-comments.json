A possible way to solve this is, making the read callback to do only creation of extracted attribute map, and do session.putSttributes outside of the callback.\nI've modified that part, tested with running NiFi flow and confirmed that worked.

I've rebased the branch, and addressed the feedback. However, while I was testing this again, I noticed that if it's running on a clustered NiFi environment, every node gets and clears offsets from Kafka. While it's working, I think these method should be executed on only the primary node, or if it's a standalone instance since offsets information is a global state among consumers.\n\nWith `@OnPrimaryNodeStateChange` annotation, it's possible to know if it's a cluster and a primary node. But it's only called if a node get elected as a primary, or a node was primary but revoked. Since other node is not notified, I couldn't distinguish standalone or primary from a processor..\nSo, I left it as it is for now. Do you know If there's a way to know if NiFi is clustered from a processor?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/231122504/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/231122985","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/563#issuecomment-231122985","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/563","id":231122985,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMTEyMjk4NQ==","user":{"login":"olegz","id":172397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjM5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/172397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz","html_url":"https://github.com/olegz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-07T15:54:47Z","updated_at":"2016-07-07T15:54:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ijokarumawak I am not yet done, but good that you have rebased.
