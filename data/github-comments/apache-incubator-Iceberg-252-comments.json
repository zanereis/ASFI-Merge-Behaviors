want to revisit this. I had a chat with @danielcweeks on the interesting subject of time zones. We also discussed how Spark is doing it, and I like that the notion of the session timestamp (same as @rdblue suggested above).\r\n\r\nIn Spark:\r\n```\r\nspark-sql> create table t1(c1 timestamp);\r\nTime taken: 0.572 seconds\r\n\r\nspark-sql> insert into t1 VALUES(now);\r\nTime taken: 4.716 seconds\r\n\r\nspark-sql> select * from t1;\r\n2023-05-10 19:51:48.241101\r\nTime taken: 2.351 seconds, Fetched 1 row(s)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo it is stored in UTC (as described in the Iceberg spec), but the session is already localized to my current timezone (it is 19:51 on the wall clock as well).\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> df = spark.read.table(\"default.t1\");\r\n>>> df\r\nDataFrame[c1: timestamp]\r\n>>> df.show(truncate=False)\r\n+--------------------------+                                                    \r\n|c1                        |\r\n+--------------------------+\r\n|2023-05-10 19:51:48.241101|\r\n+--------------------------+\r\n\r\n>>> pdf = df.toPandas()\r\n>>> pdf\r\n                          c1\r\n0 2023-05-10 19:51:48.241101\r\n\r\n>>> >>> pdf.c1\r\n0   2023-05-10 19:51:48.241101\r\nName: c1, dtype: datetime64[ns]\r\n```\r\n\r\nSpark does not assign any timestamp, which I think is wrong.\r\n\r\nWith PyIceberg:\r\n\r\n```\r\n0   2023-05-10 17:51:48.241101+00:00\r\nName: c1, dtype: datetime64[ns, UTC]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen the question is, should we also localize this information (`tz_convert`the columns to `CEST` for the Dutch).\r\n\r\nLooks like there is no `tz_convert` method for PyArrow. I think we should keep everything in UTC.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1542685254/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1542707624","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/7566#issuecomment-1542707624","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/7566","id":1542707624,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85b89mo","user":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-10T19:39:13Z","updated_at":"2023-05-10T19:39:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@marty-sullivan I think we've found the underlying issue.

Yea I am comparing the two stage trees, nothing immediately jumps out to me to say why MOR is 40 mins and the other is 17 mins.\r\n\r\nComparing the two joins, \r\n* MOR join has shuffle bytes: 207.6 GB and 50.3 GB.  \r\n* COW has two joins (first for determining list of files, second is the actual join with filter on the file list)\r\n    * 1st join has shuflfe bytes: 10.3G and 7.0 G (file list calcluation)\r\n    * 2nd join has 156.9 G and 109.3 G (final join after file filter)\r\n\r\nSo just based on that, I dont see huge difference here.\r\n\r\nAlso I notice that the data for the two runs may be different, you have 785 million and 499 million rows for COW, and then 261 million and 498 million for MOR.\r\n\r\nI am not a huge expert on Spark UI, but it was not too clear just from here how long each stage take, and which is the culprit.

In my experience, performing a rewrite after submitting multiple checkpoints in a row does not work well.\r\n\r\nThis is because the rewrite action is executed synchronously with the stream processing. It will cause the stream write to block(wait rewriteAction checkpoint success). The more data in the partition, the slower the execution. The end result is worse. Therefore, our side in the production environment abandoned such a processing scheme.\r\n\r\nThe ideal way is to start a separate service that monitors the ICEBERG table for small files and periodically initiates asynchronous rewrite tasks. HUDI has adopted this idea and HUDI has integrated the implementation of this idea inside DATASTREAM.  But ICEBERG currently does not have built-in integration of similar features.\r\n\r\nTherefore, if you need to use the data stream to access CDC data, you need to develop some operation and maintenance services for maintaining ICEBERG to assist you in completing the merging of small files.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1544261396/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1544386218","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/7430#issuecomment-1544386218","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/7430","id":1544386218,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85cDXaq","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-11T17:16:11Z","updated_at":"2023-05-11T17:16:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I thought this was already supported, but I don't see it.
