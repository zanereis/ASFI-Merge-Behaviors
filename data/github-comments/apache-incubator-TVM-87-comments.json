Memory allocation constraints are mostly for sequential stored program machines. For distributed data flow and PIM architectures the allocation must occur during execution typically just-in-time underneath the execution wavefront as it emerges in the machine. \r\n\r\nIn the Mathematics of Arrays, this resource allocation is provable optimal, and like any scheduling algorithm, the more information you have about the graph the better job you can do. Looking at the trend forward, the scheduler will disappear completely in the hardware as that is where the queuing and resource constraints are known. \r\n\r\nIt is with this simple observation that stack-based ISAs are unpleasant as the information the hw scheduler can see, is minimal.  It will need to execute the actual program to get to a representation that can feed into an optimizing scheduler for tensor compositions.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate NPU will control and manage the stack frames as well, so it can take advantage of cross function call boundary concurrency. The reason that this becomes essential for parallel hardware is that when the concurrency grows filling and draining the pipeline (think 1M+ ALUs) becomes a major limit on the execution efficiency of the machine. The hw scheduler needs to have all the information to avoid draining the execution resources.\r\n\r\nA lot of the discussion appears to be governed by how to schedule for a sequential machine. But DL is one of those applications where the sequential machine is irrelevant as the computational demands require extreme concurrency. I totally agree with @wweic that organizing this discussion by the demands for specific models is going to be a worthwhile experiment.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/473269155/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/473360766","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/2823#issuecomment-473360766","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2823","id":473360766,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MzM2MDc2Ng==","user":{"login":"kentkolze","id":14083805,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDgzODA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14083805?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentkolze","html_url":"https://github.com/kentkolze","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentkolze/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentkolze/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentkolze/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentkolze/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentkolze/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentkolze/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentkolze/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentkolze/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentkolze/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-15T16:47:48Z","updated_at":"2019-03-15T16:47:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Ah.

Sorry I was a bit late in recommend due to my latest travels. Here are some comments to the proposal\r\n\r\n- Let us start simple, while most of the proposal makes sense, there is always a risk of over-categorize, starting from front-end taxonomy makes sense\r\n   - We can open new RFC for new Error categories when we start to need them.\r\n- Do not use C++ to python callback to handle c++ exception\r\n  - The main reasoning is that we do not want to have too many backward dep from c++ to python\r\n  - Instead, use a common string format(e.g. prefix by Exception name) and translation\r\n  - Introduce an error translation function that translates TVMError message into a specific error type.\r\n- I personally do not like the raise_xyz wrapper, while for certain cases it is convenient, it is only an additional layer of abstraction. I would simply have specific error types when necessary and raise them instead of call into raise_xyz\r\n   - Take a look at other python codebases, e.g. tensorflow or pytorch to see what if there are similar use-cases, at least I did not see such style, which could be a sign on maybe we don't want to do it.\r\n- Put the error namespace under tvm/error.py (single file, because I don't think developers would ever be able to understand error hierarchy that goes beyond a single file) keep things simple\r\n   - Document each error class\r\n   - Edit the RFC to have a clear minimum error convention about each type of error and example.\r\n   - PR the error guideline to contribute/error_handling.rst\r\n\r\nPerhaps I am being pedantic, but I really want us to build something that is minimum and elegant.

We are in a fundamentally different world for executing Relay programs. The VM is only the control plane, the data plane is the the computation contained in highly optimized kernels produced by TVM. \r\n\r\nWe *no longer* compute over scalars the lessons learned from building scalar VMs and ISAs don't really apply.\r\n\r\nThe program of question is a high level data-flow program where *an* order has been selected. One simple implementation of this instruction set changes each function call  to place a future on the stack, which will eventually be completed by executing the function in parallel. \r\n\r\nThis design enables asynchronous and out of order execution while being completely opaque to the VM's compiler and end-users. If we want to enable higher level forms of speculation and parallelism we can borrow ideas from parallel functional languages to change the program before scheduling on the VM (see https://simonmar.github.io/bib/papers/monad-par.pdf). \r\n\r\nSimon has quite a few different designs in place and has used some of them to build a highly concurrent system now deployed at Facebook, the core of the library is here (https://github.com/facebook/Haxl). \r\n\r\nOn the topic of recursion, iteration and recursion are isomorphic. There is no fundamental difference, any tail-recursive function can be converted to a loop and vice-versa. In this case we perform tail-call optimization which removes the recursive call leaving only a goto instruction.\r\n\r\nIf we wanted to perform instruction level scheduling this would be no worse than the code generated by a loop, but maintains the high level properties enjoyed by Relay today.\r\n\r\nOne feature that may be more challenging is speculative execution. Speculative execution at the instruction level isn't particularly interesting in my opinion. The only meaningful speculation is at control boundaries such as loops or conditions such as TensorFlow does (https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/while_loop, see parallel iterations). \r\n\r\nIf we want to provide non-strict semantics we should just transform the source program and use a simple mechanism like the one exposed in the Par paper described above. \r\n\r\nA final argument is that the current graph-runtime is effectively a stack, with each node having pointers into it, the only difference is it can not grow and/or shrink.\r\n\r\nThe most important concern in my opinion is memory optimization. The current prototype has a new allocator API which we intend to leverage. We can perform dynamic allocation with a specialized allocation cache which will avoid repeatedly allocating memory from the system allocator.\r\n\r\nThe next step is to perform an optimization where we group allocations into blocks, and then request a dynamic block of the correct size. In this case code like loops which release, and re-request an identical size block each iteration will end up reusing the same block.\r\n\r\nA final optimization is applying a static analysis like the current memory planner where we recover static allocation sizes, note that we can no longer do this in all cases due to dynamic behavior (loops) and when we introduce dynamic tensors the shapes will not be known until runtime.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/473573466/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/473592227","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/2810#issuecomment-473592227","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2810","id":473592227,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MzU5MjIyNw==","user":{"login":"Ravenwater","id":466641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NjY0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/466641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ravenwater","html_url":"https://github.com/Ravenwater","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ravenwater/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ravenwater/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ravenwater/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ravenwater/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ravenwater/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ravenwater/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ravenwater/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ravenwater/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ravenwater/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-16T20:57:17Z","updated_at":"2019-03-16T20:57:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@jroesch that is a good argument, and I can get behind that.

Similarly, memory allocation transforms to resource reservation guarantees that occur throughout a distributed machine and become implicit during execution. To implement recursion in a domain flow architecture requires complete unrolling of the program graph and mapping it on a physical network. So, recursion on a random access machine may be cute, on a domain flow machine it is still an open research problem.

We can encourage the unified format by introducing a standard \"error message convention\" (see  https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/pull/2838/files#diff-c89317db650ce6bced36dadc47755c5fR51) developers encouraged to copy and then edit. \r\n\r\nSurprisingly, we can go quite far by using copy-editing for such kind of one-liner message and keep things consistent (this is not that different from writing similar docstrings).\r\n\r\nSecondly, there is always a need for refining the error message. For example, in the case of clear_throw,  it says the operator is not supported \"in the MXNet frontend\". If we want to have a common function (_op_not_implemented):\r\n- If it is specific to from_mxnet.py, then it is fine, and we can refine by adding \"in the MXNet frontend\"\r\n- If it is global, then the function itself can become complicated (developer need to go across files to understand such one-liner)\r\n\r\nThe plus side is that the code is easier to maintain:\r\n- Developers can easily follow what is the error message without go across the files\r\n- Refactoring error message style(which is rare) means find-replace and is usually supported by text editors.\r\n\r\nAs a middle ground, I think I am fine introducing _op_not_implemented as long as it is in the same file.

extent\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/473736546/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/473736728","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/2837#issuecomment-473736728","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2837","id":473736728,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MzczNjcyOA==","user":{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-18T01:15:51Z","updated_at":"2019-03-18T01:15:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"my

It is hard to build a single abstraction that maps well to all possible hardware platforms. \r\n\r\nRelay is still relatively high level and can be transformed into an IR subset free of a device's particular challenges, i.e by performing loop unrolling (which is also possible with recursion).\r\n\r\nA key design goal here is to provide a generic VM that satisfies common general purpose devices (i.e x86, ARM, GPU), and integrates with a class of accelerator designs. For example TPU-like devices can easily be integrated into this design as packed functions which offload a subset of the network to the device. \r\n\r\nThere are classes of models which are fundamentally recursive, and will not map to hardware devices which can not support dynamic, unbounded iteration/recursion. Many accelerators will never support executing entire models of this class, and heterogenous execution is required. \r\n\r\nA goal of Relay is to optimize and execute arbitrary models without restricting the program representation or runtime system by the semantics of the minimally expressive device. Devices with limited semantics will be unable to execute some programs and there is no way around that. \r\n\r\nIf your architecture can map dataflow style token passing to your device, i.e TensorFlow loops, then by definition you can execute a large set of recursive programs just by performing a program transform. This transformation is the inverse of the recent TF loop decompilation, and the transformation from Relay to TF is far easier.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/473758406/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/473764920","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2721#issuecomment-473764920","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2721","id":473764920,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3Mzc2NDkyMA==","user":{"login":"hlu1","id":14827759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODI3NzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14827759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlu1","html_url":"https://github.com/hlu1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlu1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlu1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlu1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlu1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlu1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlu1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlu1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlu1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlu1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-18T04:19:25Z","updated_at":"2019-03-18T04:19:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tqchen, the topi tests run in the ci-gpu.\r\n``` \r\n[topi-python-gpu] Running shell script\r\n+ docker/bash.sh tvmai/ci-gpu:v0.50 ./tests/scripts/task_python_topi.sh\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/473764920/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/473767609","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2821#issuecomment-473767609","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2821","id":473767609,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3Mzc2NzYwOQ==","user":{"login":"kazum","id":812126,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMjEyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/812126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum","html_url":"https://github.com/kazum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-18T04:38:29Z","updated_at":"2019-03-18T04:38:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tqchen I think your comment has been addressed.

I agree with your argument that the VM design should be generic and allow different ways to implement an executor. But I have a different perspective on stack VM vs register VM. I think register VM is more general than stack VM in this sense. \r\n\r\nFor example, as @Ravenwater mentioned, it's easier to implement a dataflow executor from a register VM since registers naturally reveal the data dependency. In comparison, you need more analysis to track such dependency from a stack VM. I quickly scan the monad par paper, and feels that it's an overkill and adds more complexity to VM's compiler. Using future and callback might cause more overhead imho.\r\n\r\nNow compare the complexity of register VM and stack VM. I think they're similar. Both VM designs need optimization passes like tail recursion, live-cycle analysis, memory planning. We can also have AllocTensor instructions in the register VM such that we can use memory manager to make the memory sharing opaque to VM's compiler. And we don't need to worry about register spilling if we support resizable register file.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/474132549/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/474137027","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2829#issuecomment-474137027","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2829","id":474137027,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NDEzNzAyNw==","user":{"login":"icemelon","id":2696494,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTY0OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2696494?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon","html_url":"https://github.com/icemelon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-18T23:14:06Z","updated_at":"2019-03-18T23:14:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@junrushao1994 I'm investigating whether we should go with this change...

Data Flow has no concept of space and time, just dependencies. Domain flow has a relative concept of space and time. Mapping onto a Domain Flow Architecture is akin to place-and-route, although computational graphs tend to be simpler and more structured than circuit graphs. The relationship between these two models of computation is that if you expand the computational graph to the bit-level operators you end up with a circuit graph, on which synthesis operations such as retiming and path length alignments are possible.\r\n\r\nFor tensor math and in particular tensor compositions, we want to take advantage of the structure of the tensors and tensor operators, so we will stop well short of the circuit graph and synthesize a Domain Flow program instead. But true gate synthesizers may not want to stop there and they may want to generate the full bit-level operator graph and the associated circuit graph to place-and-route on future 100BGate FPGAs. Recursion is a Random Access Memory concept that only understands sequence dependencies, and thus will never be a good abstraction for parallel hardware.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/474139097/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/474141100","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2843#issuecomment-474141100","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2843","id":474141100,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NDE0MTEwMA==","user":{"login":"slyubomirsky","id":5624871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MjQ4NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5624871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky","html_url":"https://github.com/slyubomirsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-18T23:32:20Z","updated_at":"2019-03-18T23:32:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"(Don't know what caused the test failure but it doesn't look to have anything to do with this change.)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/474141100/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/474141443","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/2812#issuecomment-474141443","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2812","id":474141443,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NDE0MTQ0Mw==","user":{"login":"yidawang","id":4458509,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NTg1MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4458509?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yidawang","html_url":"https://github.com/yidawang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yidawang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yidawang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yidawang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yidawang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yidawang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yidawang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yidawang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yidawang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yidawang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-18T23:34:06Z","updated_at":"2019-03-18T23:34:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"How should we embrace the control flow primitive changes introduced by TF 2.0?

Their operations are pretty similar to nnvm ops.  I translated the two mobilenets and the four inception models.  There's a cmake config that pulls down all the models and converts them.  Please feel free to use whatever you want from it.  I forked the NNEF Tools project, [https://github.com/jnorwood](url) and put the converter under the contrib/converters/tflite_converters/tflite_to_nnef\r\n\r\nI only added processing for the ops I needed, and I only did quantized data.  tflite uses uint8 quantization, btw, with offsets for both weights and features.
