The third cube has topN measure with my modified code.\r\nBoth  the topN measure of  the second and third cube is top100. The amount of source data is 22million, I build cube  30 days and using the same query sql. \r\n\r\nI find that both the second  and  third topN cube have a few errors to the actual. But  the second and third topN cube  is very fast than the first normal cube.\r\nThe error of the  third cube is less than the second cube about position relatively to the actual. The third \r\noptimized cube has  less error  than the second cube about the   aggregated  value.\r\n\r\nI think that  the third optimized cube may be  better than the second current code
