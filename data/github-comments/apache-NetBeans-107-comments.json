The editor will not report errors on usage of some APIs, even of the build will consequently fail. This will apply to HTML4j, I believe.\n2. The Java index won't have information about the bootclasspath, so that e.g. adding imports may not see all the required classes.\n\nSo, while I understand this fixes one problem you are seeing, I suspect it will introduce new ones.

Yes, that's what you had already written. My reply was: the current behavior is buggy and this PR makes it more acceptable.

I can add a test (source level 15, using text blocks to compile on all JDKs without errors) to make my change more acceptable.

I meant simply running as if DISABLE_SOURCE_LEVEL_DOWNGRADE was set to true. But right, for source > 8, a modular boot path is needed, and that is not readily available from JDK 8. So you are right it is not as simple as long as we need to support 8.\n\n> \n> > who will be responsible\n> \n> `TextBlocksOnAnyJavaTest` deserves to be fixed.  Once it is integrated, anyone doing changes into the IDE compiler will be responsible for not breaking it.\n\nI meant new bugs introduced by this patch. For example, with your patch, when I write `of(1, 2, 3,4)` into AsyncJavaScriptAction.storeLater, there will be no fix to add static import java.util.List.of. But if I add the import manually, there is no error in the editor. And build will fail. So there's apparently some bug somewhere in your code. At least no error in the editor, but an error during build. So if it is not fixed here, then it must be a bug in HTML4j and will be fixed there, right?\n\n> \n> > another problem ... may crash\n> \n> If you lead me I can write a test to simulate such crash.

And yes, may turn out the concerns are not valid.\n\nAnyway, in this case, set the source level in the test to some very high level '9999' for example. This crashes the test for me with a NPE at JavacParser:963.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1078847653/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1078968901","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/3851#issuecomment-1078968901","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/3851","id":1078968901,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5AT8JF","user":{"login":"ebarboni","id":6940099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDAwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6940099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni","html_url":"https://github.com/ebarboni","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-25T12:10:34Z","updated_at":"2022-03-25T12:10:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mbien add the two properties for maven user will be easy to get both I guess even if user doesn't want them at the end.

It seems, that the error comes out of the `javac` which is fed incomplete information.\r\n\r\nLocally I can reproduce the problem sometimes. Using this branch on JDK 11 I get the error after a clean build (with JDK 11 on the PATH):\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clean -f -x -d\r\nant\r\nant commit-validation\r\n```\r\n\r\nMaybe you have an idea how we could stabilize this. This might be a real problem in the infrastructure, as the test was not run on 9+ before this PR (see the removed filter in `ide/ide.kit/test/qa-functional/src/org/netbeans/modules/ide/kit/VerifySimpleTemplatesTest.java`). If I read the test procedure correctly, the test fails because it is configured to fail if an exception is logged, which is the case.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1079706207/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1079721201","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/3873#issuecomment-1079721201","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/3873","id":1079721201,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5AWzzx","user":{"login":"jgneff","id":1413266,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTMyNjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1413266?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgneff","html_url":"https://github.com/jgneff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgneff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgneff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgneff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgneff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgneff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgneff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgneff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgneff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgneff/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-26T15:55:13Z","updated_at":"2022-03-26T15:55:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"When the build fails to download an external binary because of an `IOException`, the root cause of the failure is always `null`.
