of the opinion that there are two usecases:\r\n1) BeamSqlCli: this makes sense for a registration mechanism that spans the lifetime of the CLI session. Since the interface the user is using is the CLI, the Java interface is not important to them.\r\n2) Programmatic pipeline builders: I believe that these people will be developers and \r\na) I believe that having a \"global\" registration mechanism makes it difficult for someone to reason about the code. Imagine you had the following line of code `BeamSql.simpleQuery(\"select * from TABLE_A where ...\"));`. As a developer I need to search the entire codebase for where `TABLE_A` was defined. If the code was `pcollection.apply(BeamSql.simpleQuery(\"select * from TABLE_A where ...\")));`, as a developer I can use my IDE to find and follow where `pcollection` came from. \r\nb) That a \"global\" registration mechanism doesn't allow for libraries to provide meaningful names for tables and is error prone. Imagine you had a library that used BeamSql and it had a function `myFancyQueries(...)` that ran several queries based upon several attributes. What table names should the function use (when consuming outside tables, when producing new tables, what about intermediate tables)?, What if the user invoked it multiple times at different places within their codebase (should it overwrite previous tables or define new ones)?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/309493847/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/309494094","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3385#issuecomment-309494094","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3385","id":309494094,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwOTQ5NDA5NA==","user":{"login":"vikkyrk","id":1114748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTQ3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1114748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikkyrk","html_url":"https://github.com/vikkyrk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikkyrk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikkyrk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikkyrk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikkyrk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikkyrk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikkyrk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikkyrk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikkyrk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikkyrk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-19T16:30:03Z","updated_at":"2017-06-19T16:30:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Retest
