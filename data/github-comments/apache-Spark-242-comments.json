For example,\n\n```\nassert(a ~== b absErr 0.01)\nassert(a ~== b relTol 1e-5)\n```\n\nI still recommend using `err`/`tol` that switches automatically between absolute error and relative error at `1.0`. But it is fine to be explicit.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50045370/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50047400","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1180#issuecomment-50047400","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1180","id":50047400,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMDQ3NDAw","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-24T17:05:05Z","updated_at":"2014-07-24T17:05:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA

haven't looked at the code yet.\n\nI'm a little conflicted about exposing running apps in the history server, especially this way. First, \"history\" sort of implies things that happened in the past.\n\nSecond, misbehaving apps can cause log files to never go into a \"finished\" state (e.g. by failing to call `SparkContext::stop()`) - although you can make the argument that anyone can write anything to the root log dir anyway.\n\nThird, the user experience from your screenshots is very weird. When just looking at finished apps, things are sorted one way, but when including unfinished ones, they're sorted another way. That's super confusing, especially when you have paging.\n\nIf listing running apps in the HS is really wanted, I'd suggest an approach where running apps are shown separately from finished ones. Either in a separate table, or a separate tab in the UI.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50052724/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50052884","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1576#issuecomment-50052884","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1576","id":50052884,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMDUyODg0","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-24T17:48:23Z","updated_at":"2014-07-24T17:48:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA tests have started for PR 1576.

Davies, I tried this out a bit and saw two issues / areas for improvement:\n\n1) Since the ExternalMerger is used in both map tasks and reduce tasks, one problem that can happen is that the reduce task's data is already hashed modulo the # of reduce tasks, and so you get many empty buckets. For example, if you have 2 reduce tasks, task 0 gets all the values whose hash code is even, so it can only use half its buckets. If you have 64 reduce tasks, only one bucket is used.\n\nThe best way to fix this would be to hash values with a random hash function when choosing the bucket. One simple way might be to generate a random integer X for each ExternalMerger and then take hash((key, X)) instead of hash(key) when choosing the bucket. This is equivalent to salting your hash function. Maybe you have other ideas but I'd suggest trying this first.\n\n2) I also noticed that sometimes maps would fill up again before the old memory was fully freed, leading to smaller spills. For example, for (Int, Int) pairs the first spill from 512 MB memory is about 68 MB of files, but later spills were only around 20 MB. I found that I could get better performance overall by adding some gc.collect() calls after every data.clear() and pdata.clear(). This freed more memory faster and allowed us to do more work in memory before spilling. The perf difference for one test job was around 30% but you should try it on your own jobs.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50072248/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50072351","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1460#issuecomment-50072351","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1460","id":50072351,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMDcyMzUx","user":{"login":"mateiz","id":228859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODg1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz","html_url":"https://github.com/mateiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-24T20:19:42Z","updated_at":"2014-07-24T20:19:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"BTW here's a patch that adds the GC calls I talked about above: https://gist.github.com/mateiz/297b8618ed033e7c8005\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50072351/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50073250","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1541#issuecomment-50073250","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1541","id":50073250,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMDczMjUw","user":{"login":"kayousterhout","id":1108612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDg2MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1108612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout","html_url":"https://github.com/kayousterhout","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-24T20:27:13Z","updated_at":"2014-07-24T20:27:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"When is this accessed concurrently?
