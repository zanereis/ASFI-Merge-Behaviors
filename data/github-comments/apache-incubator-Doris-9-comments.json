\r\n\r\nGood proposal, I have some questions about this proposal.\r\n\r\n1. If we support other type of index, for example B+Tree, do we need to store all index type in one index file?\r\n\r\n2. I think we should keep file immutable, so I don't agree with the second option to  add new index. What about having multiple index files for one data file? If we add a new index, we can create a new index file for it. and we can merge all index files into one index file when we do compaction.\r\n\r\n3.

The biggest advantage is drop index operation can delete the index file right away, but that operation is less frequent than add index IMO and marked delete in other approaches isn't necessarily bad.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/526113327/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/526136160","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/1716#issuecomment-526136160","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/1716","id":526136160,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNjEzNjE2MA==","user":{"login":"wuyunfeng","id":5183061,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxODMwNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5183061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuyunfeng","html_url":"https://github.com/wuyunfeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuyunfeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuyunfeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuyunfeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuyunfeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuyunfeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuyunfeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuyunfeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuyunfeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuyunfeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-29T11:00:36Z","updated_at":"2019-08-29T11:00:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-doris/issues/1525","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/526136160/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/526166188","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/issues/1723#issuecomment-526166188","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/1723","id":526166188,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNjE2NjE4OA==","user":{"login":"imay","id":1249159,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDkxNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1249159?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay","html_url":"https://github.com/imay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-29T12:39:23Z","updated_at":"2019-08-29T12:39:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@morningman \r\n\r\n我觉得我们应该还是保留Backend这个实体，而不是将Storage全部替换为Backend。\r\n1.

Storage放在一起我觉得也有不妥。FE、BE、Broker都是Doris自身的模块，是个物理存在的实体。但是Remote Storage更像是一个逻辑的概念，感觉跟其他节点放在一起讨论并不是十分适合。\r\n\r\n> Resource Attribute\r\n资源属性。一个资源可以被赋予一个多个属性。属性用于表述资源能够提供的功能或服务。比如将 Computation 和 Storage 属性赋予 Backend 这个资源。则这个 Backend 可以提供计算和存储功能。\r\n\r\n> Default\r\nDefault 属性专门赋予一些暂不支持属性，或者属性未定义的资源。如 Frontend，Broker 等。这些资源通常功能比较明确，或者暂时无需通过属性来划分功能。\r\n\r\n属性我理解更像是一个set，如果对于FE、Broker这种没有属性的节点，我个人觉得让他们的属性为空会更加好一些。属性是Default太难理解了，而且未来再增加新的属性的时候，会跟这个Default可能会有兼容性的问题。\r\n\r\n> Resource Group\r\n多个拥有相同资源属性的资源可以组成一个资源组。一些操作可以指定一个资源组，来使用组内的资源共同完成一项功能。比如在建表时，可以指定数据分片的副本分布在指定的一组拥有存储属性的 Backend 资源中；或者在查询时，指定一组拥有计算属性的 Backend 资源进行查询。\r\n\r\n> 资源必须属于至少一个资源组。因为对资源的使用，是以资源组为单位的。一个资源可以属于多个资源组。资源组中只能包含相同类型的资源，但是资源的属性可以不同。\r\n\r\n我觉得我们可以没有group的概念，只是提供tag机制。其实这我觉得是可以跟attribute合成一个的。如果说拆出来的话，可能是作为用户自定义属性？因为你定义为Group，可能就需要Group的管理，但其实我们的Group可能是个很松散的Group，是用时才发现的Group。所以我理解这里作为一个attribute扩充就可以了。\r\n\r\n但是我们需要考虑的一个问题是，假如我们要支持跨机房部署，那么我们可以把三个副本分配在不同的Group中。但是查询的时候我们可能要某个查询尽量的都在一个Group中。但是这个很难表达，所以我们可能需要支持一些指定的属性，比如，“location”这种属性。\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/527861098/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/527863509","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/issues/1652#issuecomment-527863509","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/1652","id":527863509,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNzg2MzUwOQ==","user":{"login":"gaodayue","id":1198446,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTg0NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1198446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaodayue","html_url":"https://github.com/gaodayue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaodayue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaodayue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaodayue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaodayue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaodayue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaodayue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaodayue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaodayue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaodayue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-04T11:39:52Z","updated_at":"2019-09-04T11:39:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I
