two cents: If the developer requires a long running container containing previous state (i.e. cache files) from previous ation/function run, then maybe the workload is not best fit for to be solve using serverless. The workload looks like is best solve by normal deamon/server platform.\n\nI'm not familair with the specific use case but I would solve the problem in a different way if I was going to use serverless. \nIf there is a large archive 500MB-1GB that the function needs to be initialize, then I would consider this archive part of the definition of the action. \nI would create a new docker action specific for the function include the 500MB archive and push the docker image. creating, and deleting actions unique actions are trivial in whisk.\nThen whisk will use the container at the time of doing the computation and run the docker container containing logic code and archive (model).\n\nToday there is small delay for whisk to pull down and cache the docker action, but this can be optimized in the future if whisk were to offer a docker registry that user can push their docker images to.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/238057832/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/238072614","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/994#issuecomment-238072614","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/994","id":238072614,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzODA3MjYxNA==","user":{"login":"mbehrendt","id":4745697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDU2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4745697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbehrendt","html_url":"https://github.com/mbehrendt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbehrendt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbehrendt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbehrendt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbehrendt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbehrendt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbehrendt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbehrendt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbehrendt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbehrendt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-07T09:27:24Z","updated_at":"2016-08-07T09:27:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"i
