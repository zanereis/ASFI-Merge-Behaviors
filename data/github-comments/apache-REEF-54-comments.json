I'm not sure if there are many use-cases when the user would want to submit the second type of workload, but everything should just work fine as long as the final aggregation is associative and the groupings can be done arbitrarily. Going with the second API makes constructing the submission objects a lot more verbose and there will be more objects to serialize. With the first API, the user won't need to match the return values to their input-function pair, but only to their input since there is only one single \"map\" function, so to speak. If the user wants different logic in their function based on their input, the user can always incorporate the different types of logic into a single `VortexFunction` via if-else, although this isn't particularly ideal.\n\nWhat do you think? Personally I am leaning towards the first API.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/172609455/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/172691308","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/768#issuecomment-172691308","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/768","id":172691308,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MjY5MTMwOA==","user":{"login":"yunseong","id":1748276,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDgyNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1748276?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunseong","html_url":"https://github.com/yunseong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunseong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunseong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunseong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunseong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunseong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunseong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunseong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunseong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunseong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-19T00:25:14Z","updated_at":"2016-01-19T00:25:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@afchung I'm totally +1 on the first API.
