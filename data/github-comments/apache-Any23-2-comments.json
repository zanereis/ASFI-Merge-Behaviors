@ansell , in my last commit I've pushed a coupe of (hopefully) satisfying additions, namely\r\n * removal of open module from CLI (meaning that, by default the open extractor is not executed by default during normal unit test execution)\r\n * addition of some class loading logic which improves the flexibility of extractor detection based upon the presence of the open extractor.\r\n\r\nBy default now, open tests are not executed by default... this will dramatically reduce 1) the time of tests, and 2) he memory required to execute the tests.\r\n\r\nThanks for any final review.\r\nLewis","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/any23/issues/comments/324436113/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/any23/issues/comments/328227427","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/any23/pull/43#issuecomment-328227427","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/any23/issues/43","id":328227427,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyODIyNzQyNw==","user":{"login":"lewismc","id":1165719,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjU3MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1165719?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc","html_url":"https://github.com/lewismc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-08T22:22:03Z","updated_at":"2017-09-08T22:22:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@jgrzebyta

don't have time right now to debug this or work on its design. It isn't a pattern I have worked on in the past. All ``ServiceLoader`` projects that I have worked on in the past either have all of the service Factory objects initialised as startup, or they do periodic scans, but always create and initialise the service Factory objects whenever they are discovered. \r\n\r\nIs this issue attempting to delay/extract the OpenIE initialisation by delaying/postponing the Factory initialisation? If so, the focus could possibly be on making the OpenIE initialisation lazy to only occur when the Factory is actually required/used to create an object instance.\r\n\r\nA more configurable lifecycle possibly requires OSGi, which I again have absolutely no experience with, but from the little understanding each time I look, it appears to allow user driven initialisation (push rather than pull, if that makes sense).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/any23/issues/comments/364256849/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/any23/issues/comments/364555954","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/any23/pull/60#issuecomment-364555954","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/any23/issues/60","id":364555954,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDU1NTk1NA==","user":{"login":"ferrerod","id":4383317,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzODMzMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4383317?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferrerod","html_url":"https://github.com/ferrerod","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferrerod/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferrerod/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferrerod/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferrerod/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferrerod/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferrerod/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferrerod/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferrerod/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferrerod/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-09T20:28:43Z","updated_at":"2018-02-09T20:28:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@HansBrende @lewismc: Today, I cloned master and tried to build: mvn clean install and the core build is failing.
