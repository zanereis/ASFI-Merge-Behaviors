is the database backend? Postgres? Druid?\r\n\r\nOne path towards a solution is to improve the json serializer function `utils.json_iso_dttm_ser` to handle that specific object type in a specific way.\r\n\r\nWe may want Superset to support some sort of spacial pivot format that we'd serialize towards. Something as simple as `[lat, long]` in json. Then we'd have to add support for that in a fancy spacial control where you'd have the choice to select one of these new spacial column, or point to a 2 different columns for lat and long (like we do currently in the mapbox viz). People may have a spacial column, or they may have a lat and a long column. Superset should work with both.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, if you just want stuff to work, you need to write 2 column expressions, one for lat and one for long, using your database's engine builtin function. I'd assume there's some sort of `get_longitude(spacial_typed_column)` function you can use, and used that in the mapbox

I can't just flush the dataframe to a SQLA database as a one-off exercise because I need the slice to be able to show up to date information (bearing in mind the cache timeout on the slice).\r\n\r\nI'm new to Superset, so I may have misunderstood the processing - in which case, please correct me...\r\n\r\nThere seem to be two main types of web request going on:\r\n\r\n1. requests from the editors (slices or SQL Lab) while an analyst is designing a new slice.\r\n2. requests from the slices when they are being visualized\r\n\r\nIn the event that you have a SQLA connector, then each web request involves creating a connection to the DB (unless pooled), executing a query which does the read/filter/aggregate/compute and returns the data. I.e. the work to be done is the same, but in the SQLA case we are doing it on the database server, whereas I was proposing doing it on the web server. I recognize that doing it on the database server is sensible for most use cases.\r\n\r\nMy understanding of how Superset works is that once the slices have been designed, then the results of the query can be cached. I.e. once a slice has been published that does its filter/aggregate/compute in Pandas, it would only be doing it once per cache expiry period, because the result of that computation would be stored in the cache and each time the slice is viewed the result would be returned directly from cache.\r\n\r\nI did think of an alternative approach where `PandasConnector` is a subclass of `SqlaTable` with extra fields/columns for the remote URL and the Pandas read method. When we define the \"table\", we pull the file/url, read it using `read_csv` or whatever method has been designated, and then save it to the designated table name using `Dataframe.to_sql`. Then we can allow all the functionality inherited from `SqlaTable to be used for filtering, grouping, etc.\r\n\r\nIf we take this approach, then each time we need to read the data from SQLA table, we need to first fetch the up to date data from the remote URL, read it into Pandas, drop the existing SQL table, write a new table from the Pandas DataFrame, then execute the query. As far as I can tell, executing the query involves reading the results back into a Pandas Dataframe using `pd.read_sql`. This also seems inefficient, and in many cases it will be slower that the pure Pandas approach, because the cost of writing the table to the database just in order to execute the query and then read it back could well be slower than the time taken to just do the filter/group/aggregate in Pandas. However, the `SqlaTable` could be in a SQLite `:memory:` database, or a \"temporary\" database (memory with overflow to disk) which might speed things a little.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/323587548/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/323595124","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/2743#issuecomment-323595124","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/2743","id":323595124,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMzU5NTEyNA==","user":{"login":"dofine","id":440101,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MDEwMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/440101?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dofine","html_url":"https://github.com/dofine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dofine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dofine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dofine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dofine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dofine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dofine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dofine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dofine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dofine/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-20T16:15:18Z","updated_at":"2017-08-20T16:17:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Doesn't seem to work for me. \r\nI believe I have set the flag to True and added datasource to the Public role.\r\nPublic role can see the dashboard, but clicking it, the slices in the dashboard says access is denied.\r\nCan you help me plz @qq273681448 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/323595124/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/323603943","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/3302#issuecomment-323603943","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/3302","id":323603943,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMzYwMzk0Mw==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-20T18:49:13Z","updated_at":"2017-08-20T18:49:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I'm guessing your REST API is backend by some sort of database, couldn't you just access that?\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if you don't own that database and want to run analytical workloads off of it, shouldn't you just write a data pipeline to bring that data over into a local datastore?\r\n\r\nHow would the owner of that service feel when front-loading the cache in the morning?

The data is largely stored in a monolithic table which contains a JSONB column that contains the data of real interest. The fields in the JSONB column vary in a NoSQL fashion. The REST API extracts this data and presents it in a recognizable tabular form to the analysts.\r\n\r\nI don't think I could give the analysts access to the underlying table using Superset because it would be too hard for them to write the SQL to extract the data values that they want from the JSONB column.\r\n\r\nWe have considered creating views on the monolithic table that provide the correct view of the data, and we could automate that step. But if we give analysts direct access to those views then we loose all the fine-grained permissions that are enforced by the REST API and we would have to duplicate the permissions model in Postgresql.\r\n\r\nWe think we have a design for pushing down the filtering to our specific REST API in a subclass of a generic PandasConnector. I can also imagine how some other specific implementations might be able to push down grouping and aggregating.\r\n\r\nAt the moment though, any custom connector has to be prepared to implement the whole `BaseDatasource` API and that will be too hard and/or expensive for many people. I was hoping for a generic connector that could be used as a starting point for those want to connect to niche data sources. A generic connector that uses Pandas to read and then a local SQLA database as a interim data store would also work.\r\n\r\nI accept that my use case with small data volumes from a REST API is not the main target audience for Superset and it might not be that valuable to others.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/323612803/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/323618011","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/875#issuecomment-323618011","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/875","id":323618011,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMzYxODAxMQ==","user":{"login":"alanmcruickshank","id":4670904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NzA5MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4670904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanmcruickshank","html_url":"https://github.com/alanmcruickshank","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanmcruickshank/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanmcruickshank/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanmcruickshank/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanmcruickshank/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanmcruickshank/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanmcruickshank/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanmcruickshank/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanmcruickshank/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanmcruickshank/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-20T23:09:07Z","updated_at":"2017-08-20T23:09:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@gclsoft -
