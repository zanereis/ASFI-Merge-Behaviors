Compatibility is not the serializers immediate concern.\r\n  - The current design means that the serializer mutates internal fields on reconfiguration. That is error prone. Consider a serializer like the KryoSerializer, where the configuration is not fully deep copied on duplication (makes sense, it is read only during serialization). Mutating that configuration would change the behavior of other previously duplicated serializers as well, which is unexpected.\r\n\r\nThoughts for improvements with lower priority:\r\n\r\n  - Can we avoid setting the ClassLoader into a field in the config snapshot, and then deserializing? I think such solutions are fragile and should be avoided if possible. The ClassLoader is not really part of the snapshots state, it is an auxiliary to the deserialization and should, as such, be passed as an argument to the read method: read(in, classloader). This means that the TypeSerializerConfigSnapshot would not implement `IOReadableWritable`, but that might be not a problem.\r\n\r\n  - Is the TypeSerializerConfigSnapshotSerializationProxy needed? It seems like an unnecessary indirection given that it is used exclusively in the TypeSerializerSerializationUtil and could be a static util method instead.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/403020970/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/403021796","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6210#issuecomment-403021796","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6210","id":403021796,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMzAyMTc5Ng==","user":{"login":"twalthr","id":5746567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDY1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5746567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr","html_url":"https://github.com/twalthr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-06T12:38:21Z","updated_at":"2018-07-06T12:38:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"After knowing that we have to use the `run-single-test.sh` script.

@zhangminglei , thanks very much for your PR. \r\n\r\nAs for dependencies, I think it is better to move ORC related classes into the module of `flink-orc`, so we don't need to add orc dependency in module of `flink-connector-filesystem`.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the `OrcFileWriter` should implement interface `CheckpointedFunction` to prevent loss of data in `rowBatch` during job failover. During checkpointing, you can store the data in `rowBatch` into state, or call `flush()`. Similar logic can be found in `BucketingSink`.\r\n\r\nBest, Hequn.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/403212376/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/403213373","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6266#issuecomment-403213373","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6266","id":403213373,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMzIxMzM3Mw==","user":{"login":"hequn8128","id":4971479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NzE0Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4971479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hequn8128","html_url":"https://github.com/hequn8128","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hequn8128/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hequn8128/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hequn8128/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hequn8128/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hequn8128/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hequn8128/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hequn8128/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hequn8128/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hequn8128/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-07T12:45:46Z","updated_at":"2018-07-07T12:45:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @yanghua , I think if the description is too long, we can simply cut off the description.

There is a couple of problems with this implementation though:\r\n* ConfluentSchemaRegistry follows the idea that schemas are grouped by topic name. Providing the topic name in ctor of `SerializationSchema` will break this assumption when used with topic pattern. I think we should somehow enable passing schema from `KafkaProducer` to `SerializationSchema`, but it would require far more changes.\r\n* You assume in `RegistryAvroSerializationSchema` that schema is always represented with a single  id(`int`). That is true only for the ConfluentSchemaRegistry, e.g. HortonworksSchemaRegistry uses metadata-id(`long`) and version id(`int`). The idea of `SchemaCoder` was to abstract away all \"vendor\" specific features.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/403404110/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/403408096","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6176#issuecomment-403408096","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6176","id":403408096,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMzQwODA5Ng==","user":{"login":"kent2171","id":8298494,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyOTg0OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8298494?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kent2171","html_url":"https://github.com/kent2171","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kent2171/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kent2171/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kent2171/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kent2171/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kent2171/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kent2171/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kent2171/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kent2171/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kent2171/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-09T08:53:35Z","updated_at":"2018-07-09T08:53:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"nice
