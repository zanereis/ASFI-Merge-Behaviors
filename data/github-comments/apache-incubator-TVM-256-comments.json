@areusch , @tqchen , @manupa-arm , \r\nAbout the target vs build discussion. I think we all agree that the executor should not be part of the target, but it should be a build parameter. \r\n\r\nThe question is if adding the build parameter now, or if doing it in another PR. The point is that the executor is really only used in `build_module.cc` , so moving it as a build parameter seems the best choice. This also avoids hacky workarounds in situations where the `target_host` is not defined (e.g., `cuda`). \r\n\r\nI understand the argument to leave it as a target option now and then move all the target options in an option object in a later PR. But I would prefer to reduce the number of hacks for AOT from day 1, and in a later PR try to uniform crt and link-params to AOT. In other words, if there are no drawbacks, let's try to make AOT the \"proper\" way and let's then address the other target options to uniform to AOT.

The point is that the executor is really only used in `build_module.cc` , so moving it as a build parameter seems the best choice. This also avoids hacky workarounds in situations where the `target_host` is not defined (e.g., `cuda`).\r\n> \r\n> I understand the argument to leave it as a target option now and then move all the target options in an option object in a later PR. But I would prefer to reduce the number of hacks for AOT from day 1, and in a later PR try to uniform crt and link-params to AOT. In other words, if there are no drawbacks, let's try to make AOT the \"proper\" way and let's then address the other target options to uniform to AOT. Thoughts?\r\n\r\nMy two cents for this is : for now \"executor\" being only consumed by relay build, I'd would prefer it be an argument over putting it in the target (between the two options of having it inside the target vs relay.build arg).\r\n\r\nI agree with the general direction we need to a way to convey compilation flags that are not strictly associated with target. However, the options described here (runtime, link-params) runs deeper than the relay.build, therefore when those could be refactored into compiler options \"object\", we could also make the executor part of it. What do others think ?\r\n(I think what we are discussing is where to put the \"executor\" until compiler options \"object\" is introduced)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/828430178/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/828544206","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/7849#issuecomment-828544206","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7849","id":828544206,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyODU0NDIwNg==","user":{"login":"AlexanderSerov","id":33323782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzIzNzgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33323782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderSerov","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexanderSerov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderSerov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderSerov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderSerov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderSerov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderSerov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderSerov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderSerov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderSerov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderSerov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-28T15:20:45Z","updated_at":"2021-04-28T15:20:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tqchen Thanks, that works.

The overarching problem is the Target string is used to key autotvm logs, so adding non-autotuning attrs to Target means that tuning logs can't be directly used when those attrs change. To address this, we will either need: a) a new e.g. runtime-options object or b) a way to filter the non-autotvm related attrs from Target when building the tuning log key. A related question is whether or not we have a way to raise an exception when a user specifies an unregistered Target key--I can't remember offhand but suspect @zxybazh knows. This would become more important when we split config into two objects and need to provide feedback when the user accidentally specifies e.g. executor as part of Target.\r\n\r\nWe also discussed that it's possible executor could have a place in Target in the future, should graph-level tuning further evolve. However, here we need to implement something that reflects the present-day state of the repo. We have two options proposed:\r\n1. add `--executor=` with no default to Target, which will not affect tune logs except in cases where aot executor is used.\r\n2. add `executor=` as a `relay.build` kwarg.\r\n\r\nBoth of these are hacky--the proper thing is something like the a) or b) solutions proposed above. Between hacks 1 and 2, the downside of 1 has been spelled out earlier here, and the downside of 2 is that it creates a fairly central kwarg we'll have to deprecate in the near future. I guess I have a preference for solution 1), because we already include `--runtime` in Target, so in that we'll need to \"deprecate\" the `--runtime` Target attr as well, we are deprecating things in a single place rather than in two.

tensor(float)\r\n`Gemm`: tensor(double), tensor(float)\r\n`Add`, `Mul`, `Sub`: tensor(double), tensor(float), tensor(int32), tensor(int64)\r\n\r\nIt shows that the above operators cannot accept int8

successfully, should TVM support the import of them and generate correct qnn ops?

I agree that a decision about output aliasing can be a big undertaking to mark in the IR itself. The rationale that brings the current PR os structured as follows:\r\n\r\n- K0 The reshape only property is a property with respect to the function itself, without breaching into the property of the phyiscal execution\r\n- K1 The graph execution generator takes that property to generate eliding.\r\n\r\nNote that majority part of the property marking in K0 more strict than C1, due to the reason that aliasing info breaches the semantics while K0 is considered as an annotation of the function property, the backend can still choose to implement reshape only function by actually running the code or eliding and nop. The annotation K0 does not imply the decision.\r\n\r\nK1 have to happen at some time point, and can be both target and operation dependent. Given that right now the memory planning and executions are coupled at the graph runtime codegen, the current change to the graph runtime is consistent with that choice. \r\n\r\nAs we start to factor out more of memory alloca and execution into seperate passes, I agree that introducing physical specific annotations  would then make sense since the decisions will then be passed across a few stages.\r\n\r\nThe target dependence of K1 is indeed something worth thinking about. Given that the current graph planner already assumes flat memory, my assumption is that a separate planning and execution generator will be needed for the N-D case, where we can skip this choice for now(note that the reshape only is a property tag rather than a tag that enforces the execution).\r\n\r\nBack to the general topic of aliasing memory. I think that problem would be a bigger decision indeeds deserves an RFC and more in-depth thoughts(I don't think marking aliasing in the graph directly is the right approach as you said it changes the semantics of the graph in an early stage). This PR is mainly intended as a incremental improvement to the graph executor that is handle the case of reshape in a consistent way as VM(which already elides reshape) in the case of flat memory scenario. \r\n\r\nWe can certainly bring followup refactors once we have a good proposal to handle aliasing memory. \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/829551076/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/829558024","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7945#issuecomment-829558024","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7945","id":829558024,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyOTU1ODAyNA==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-29T20:01:42Z","updated_at":"2021-04-29T20:01:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Added comments about the flat memory assumptions and TODOs about what can be done under non-flat settings once the support is introduced","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/829558024/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/829611498","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7945#issuecomment-829611498","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7945","id":829611498,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyOTYxMTQ5OA==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-29T21:35:04Z","updated_at":"2021-04-29T21:40:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"reshape only was a property about the function itself, the property have well-defined meaning in functional land.

While alias tag would likely need to only appear when we start to think about memory planning.\r\n\r\nFor general ops, having alias information alone may not give a complete picture, as the operator semantics itself is also part of the picture. For some ops, alias needs to be enforced(e.g. case of scatter sparse add to dense), while others the impact is more minimum(e.g. reshape).  Reshape only in that regard is a more narrow tag that specifies the op semantics as well\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/829611498/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/829660797","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7928#issuecomment-829660797","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7928","id":829660797,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyOTY2MDc5Nw==","user":{"login":"AndrewZhaoLuo","id":13855451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODU1NDUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13855451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo","html_url":"https://github.com/AndrewZhaoLuo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-29T23:21:47Z","updated_at":"2021-04-29T23:21:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ok ONNX integration is done now, as should be most frontend tests.
