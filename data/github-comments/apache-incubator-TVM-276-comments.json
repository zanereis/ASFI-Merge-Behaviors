If the schedule is almost the same for the two target, maybe a better approach is to modifiy the target process part of tvm.\r\n\r\n@jcf94 Thanks for the feedback. This is a very good call actually.\r\n\r\nYes Bifrost is the second generation of Mali GPU but not the most recent one. Although most of the recently released devices are probably Bifrost-based. \r\n\r\nMy goal at the moment is to allow more models being compiled with Mali and Bifrost without adding too much maintenance and duplication. But in a longer term, it might make sense to revisit Mali target design in TVM. I just don't have enough familiarity with it at the moment to suggest good viable directions yet.

For example, ONNX graph also put some shapes to the model parameters, but their constant values are maintained in the model artifacts when the model is frozen, so it may just need `extra_param_names`. As a result, instead of fixing this issue one-by-one, I'm wondering if we could have a unified solution. Specifically, can we do the following to achieve the same goal?\r\n1. Get a dynamic graph via a frontend.\r\n2. Bind parameters (i.e., `batch_size`) by name.\r\n3. Run `DynamicToStatic` to get a static graph.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the above flow should result in the same outcome without this PR (assuming `DynamicToStatic` is doing a good job). If that works, it could be the best practice for not only TF but all frameworks IMHO.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/891185932/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/891213392","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8274#issuecomment-891213392","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8274","id":891213392,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM41HtZQ","user":{"login":"mbrookhart","id":4065489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNjU0ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4065489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart","html_url":"https://github.com/mbrookhart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-02T17:45:41Z","updated_at":"2021-08-02T17:45:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tmoreau89 @zhanghaohit those comments did not, in fact, prevent the tutorial from being run, so this still failed.

On CPU targets, our sorting related ops are implemented in C++ https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/main/src/runtime/contrib/sort/sort.cc#L436, and they don't support fp16. So ops like `topk`, `argsort`, `nms` etc do not work on fp16 + cpu target combination. We can add all of them to the NEVER list, but then that would introduce unnecessary cast for GPU targets because sorting on GPU is implemented in TIR so it doesn't have issues with fp16.\r\n\r\nMaybe we need to add a specialized CPU sort for fp16 or rewrite CPU sort in TIR...
