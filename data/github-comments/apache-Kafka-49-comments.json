I was hoping to just prefix _all_ the log configs in `KafkaConfig` with log and the `LogConfig` doc would simply say that the server defaults are the same but with a prefix of log.

E.g., `flush.ms` in `LogConfig` `flush.interval.ms` in `KafkaConfig`; and even trickier: `log.roll.jitter.{ms,hours}` in `KafkaConfig` vs `segment.jitter.ms`\n\nThese changes just ensure that the server log configs are prefixed with log., but do not eliminate the need for a conversion table.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/194691809/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/194718922","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1024#issuecomment-194718922","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1024","id":194718922,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5NDcxODkyMg==","user":{"login":"ewencp","id":47366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp","html_url":"https://github.com/ewencp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-10T07:43:06Z","updated_at":"2016-03-10T07:43:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM.

I have measured the latency of processing `KafkaApis.getTopicMetadata` in `handleTopicMetadataRequest`. I pre-create 1000 topics with 5 partitions each, and observe the latency of the topic metadata requests while issuing produce requests from the same producer to a random topic out of the 1000 created. This setup essentially issues a topic metadata request every time the producer hits an unknown topic. The latency of `getTopicMetadata` is currently around 4ms once the number of topics requested gets larger, which is pretty much what I get with 0.8.2. Before this latest change it was around 8-9ms with this branch.   \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/194906675/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/194907304","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/988#issuecomment-194907304","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/988","id":194907304,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5NDkwNzMwNA==","user":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-10T15:35:38Z","updated_at":"2016-03-10T15:35:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Good to know @fpj, thanks for checking.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/194907304/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/194964066","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/792#issuecomment-194964066","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/792","id":194964066,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5NDk2NDA2Ng==","user":{"login":"bondj","id":4749778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDk3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4749778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bondj","html_url":"https://github.com/bondj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bondj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bondj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bondj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bondj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bondj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bondj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bondj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bondj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bondj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-10T17:18:59Z","updated_at":"2016-03-10T17:18:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@granthenke @ewencp @ijuma will this be included in to the next release of kafka?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/194964066/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/194971426","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/932#issuecomment-194971426","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/932","id":194971426,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5NDk3MTQyNg==","user":{"login":"vahidhashemian","id":13593506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTkzNTA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13593506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian","html_url":"https://github.com/vahidhashemian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-10T17:39:42Z","updated_at":"2016-03-10T17:39:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@gwenshap @granthenke @ijuma @ewencp Thanks for your feedback.

I had a look at this and I updated the benchmark a little:\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/ijuma/da362d00ae45cf477e7e\n\nData points of interest:\n\n``` scala\nval numTopics = 100\nval numPartitions = 1000 // per topic\nval numBrokers = 10\nval querySize = 100\n```\n\nCompiled with Scala 2.11.8, executed with JDK 8 update 76:\n\n```\n[info] Benchmark                                Mode  Cnt   Score   Error  Units\n[info] MetadataCacheBenchmark.getTopicMetadata  avgt   10  50.082 ± 6.523  ms/op\n```\n\nI tweaked things a little and got it down to less than half the time:\n\n```\n[info] Benchmark                                Mode  Cnt   Score   Error  Units\n[info] MetadataCacheBenchmark.getTopicMetadata  avgt   10  20.170 ± 0.459  ms/op\n```\n\nA couple of observations:\n- The innermost statement of the innermost loop is executed (numTopics \\* numPartitions \\* aliveReplicas) + (numTopics \\* numPartitions \\* aliveIsr), which can be a relatively large number.\n- The new protocol classes do a bit more work than the old ones as they populate the `Struct` instance during construction.\n- It's actually not straightforward to cache the protocol responses as the security protocol is passed as a parameter. It would be easy to replace `PartitionStateInfo` with `UpdateMetadataRequest.PartitionState`, but this isn't much of a win in terms of performance.\n\nPull request is here:\n\nhttps://github.com/hachikuji/kafka/pull/1\n\nTests passed locally.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/195380067/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/195430785","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1051#issuecomment-195430785","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1051","id":195430785,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5NTQzMDc4NQ==","user":{"login":"enothereska","id":14234336,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjM0MzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14234336?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska","html_url":"https://github.com/enothereska","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-11T16:10:29Z","updated_at":"2016-03-11T16:10:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The string change makes the test pass, but more is needed to actually meet the exact spec of what the test is about.

For example, we called producer.send() on 10 messages to a partition and after that buffer is full. Now if user send the 11th message they will receive TimeoutException which is an API exception. callback of the 11th message will be fired in the user thread before the callbacks of the previous 11 messages are invoked in the sender thread.\n\nAlso, if an application wants order guarantee without data loss. They will close the producer with zero timeout in the callback. However, this assumption is based on the fact that the callback is only fired in the sender thread. If an exception is thrown in the user thread, it is always safe for user to retry.\n\nAnother thing a little weird is that It seems currently timeoutException is an API exception because it extends from RetriableException. But TimeoutException seems a purely client side exception.  Maybe we should just extend from runtime exception. But this is orthogonal to this fix.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/195645342/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/195677429","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1009#issuecomment-195677429","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1009","id":195677429,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5NTY3NzQyOQ==","user":{"login":"lindong28","id":5873403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NzM0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5873403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28","html_url":"https://github.com/lindong28","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-12T07:13:15Z","updated_at":"2016-03-12T07:13:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@junrao Would you have time to take another look at the patch?

I agree with you about the out-or-order callback triggering issue. As for the fix, I think we can either 1) change all the ApiExceptions to KafkaExceptions to still guarantee that they are only thrown in callback, hence compatible APIs; 2) push the exception to the corresponding batch to let the sender thread to trigger these exceptions in order instead of throwing it directly from caller thread.\n\nAFAIK there are two exceptions that can be thrown by caller thread: RecordTooLargeException and TimeoutException (I may miss any exceptions). I think TimeoutException is treated as RetriableException since in consumer client, it is used to decide that metadata refresh can be retried upon timed up; and RecordTooLargeException is treated as an ApiException since it could be returned from broker and has a corresponding error code. So I feel both of them cannot be simply moved out of ApiException category.\n\nSo I'm thinking the most appropriate fix would be 2) above, it would be more complex than your proposal, but it guarantees the separate handling as @ijuma mentioned.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/196025325/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
