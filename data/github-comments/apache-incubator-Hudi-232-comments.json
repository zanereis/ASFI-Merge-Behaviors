See how tests in `TestHoodieDeltaStreamer` and `TestHoodieSparkMergeOnReadTableCompaction` are setup.

@fengjian428 Thanks for adding integ test. I would recommend if you can extract the integ test to a separate PR then it would be easier to review this one.

See how tests in `TestHoodieDeltaStreamer` and `TestHoodieSparkMergeOnReadTableCompaction` are setup. We need to change the payload class config there.\r\n> \r\n> So, let's keep integration test in a separate PR and add unit tests as suggested above in this PR. This way we can isolate failures if any and fix them sooner.\r\n\r\nSure, will create another pr for integ-test\r\n\r\n@codope For now,  we only check row count In `TestHoodieDeltaStreamer` and `TestHoodieSparkMergeOnReadTableCompaction` . Do you mean I need to check what the data is when testing partial update payload?\r\nIf so, seems I need to implement a new TestDataSource and use HoodieTestDataGenerator to generate some partial update
