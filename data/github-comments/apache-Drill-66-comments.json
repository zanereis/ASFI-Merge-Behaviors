\r\nThanks for the quick review!  I have a few more things to tweak before it's ready for the next round of review, but I've noticed a very significant improvement in query performance on my machine with the log files with the refactoring.  Did you see any difference?\r\n\r\nI have a question for you regarding the file extension.  Right now, Drill uses the file extension to determine which format plugin to use for parsing the file(s).  One other option that Drill has is the `defaultInputFormat` which is an option for a given workspace.  I'd imagine that in a real world situation, web server logs would be contained as they are generated in a directory or series of directories.  What you could do in that case, is define a workspace and set the `defaultInputFormat` to httpd and that would tell Drill to use the HTTPD plugin even when there are no file extensions specified.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n       \"weblogs\": {\r\n         \"location\": \"<path to logs>\",\r\n         \"writable\": false,\r\n         \"defaultInputFormat\": \"httpd\"\r\n       }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith that said, I do like the idea of allowing users to define a pattern for filenames that would be associated with a particular file type. I think that might be out of scope for this PR however.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/727583315/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/727583459","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2115#issuecomment-727583459","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2115","id":727583459,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyNzU4MzQ1OQ==","user":{"login":"nielsbasjes","id":240096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDA5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/240096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes","html_url":"https://github.com/nielsbasjes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-15T15:01:30Z","updated_at":"2020-11-15T15:01:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It worked on my machine \r\n```\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Reactor Summary for Apache Drill Root POM 1.19.0-SNAPSHOT:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Apache Drill Root POM ..............................

I do have a few questions for you:\r\n\r\n1. Is there a dissector for user agent strings?  I'd like to include that if possible so that the user doesn't have to call UDFs to get user agent info.  However, this could cause performance degradation, so if this is possible, I might make a config option to disable it by default. \r\n\r\n2.  I made some modifications to use the default timestamp parser instead of asking this from the user.  (The user can still specify one, but if the field is `null` then it doesn't get passed.). In doing so, I ran into another issue.  If you look at the setter below, I still need to get an actual timestamp so that I can send the timestamp to the Drill `ScalarWriter`.  Unfortunately, the parser is sending a `String` and hence, I still need a format string. Is there a way to either: \r\na.  Get the format string from the parser? Or\r\nb.  Get the parser to return a timestamp of some sort so that I don't have to do the conversion?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/drill/blob/a53402eb9cc3c602aa55565e95ce01ef9b917249/contrib/format-httpd/src/main/java/org/apache/drill/exec/store/httpd/HttpdLogRecord.java#L120-L140\r\n\r\nHere's where the results are being mapped to the setters:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/drill/blob/a53402eb9cc3c602aa55565e95ce01ef9b917249/contrib/format-httpd/src/main/java/org/apache/drill/exec/store/httpd/HttpdLogRecord.java#L321-L326\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/727600766/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/727842570","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2112#issuecomment-727842570","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2112","id":727842570,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyNzg0MjU3MA==","user":{"login":"nielsbasjes","id":240096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDA5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/240096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes","html_url":"https://github.com/nielsbasjes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-16T09:08:10Z","updated_at":"2020-11-16T09:08:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Regarding 1: There is a LogParser Dissector (UserAgentDissector) that uses Yauaa: https://yauaa.basjes.nl/UDF-LogParser.html . \r\nYou can of course enable/disable this with a setting. I think you can also simply enable it by default as the parsing is automatically optimized out if you do not ask for the parse result fields. So if you only select certain fields then the runtime performance difference should be 0.\r\n\r\nRegarding 2: In the LogParser there is already code to further parse the timestamp format into usable parts. For this situation I think the best way to obtain the timestamp in a usable generic form is by retrieving (for example) the `TIME.EPOCH:request.receive.time.epoch` as this is a `long` that is the number of milliseconds since 1970-01-01 which would simplify the code to having a setter `public void setTimestamp(long value)` which can then simply do something like `Instant.ofEpochMilli(something)`. This way you are leveraging the parsing capabilities I've already built into the system.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/727842570/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/727902776","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2112#issuecomment-727902776","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2112","id":727902776,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyNzkwMjc3Ng==","user":{"login":"nielsbasjes","id":240096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDA5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/240096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes","html_url":"https://github.com/nielsbasjes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-16T10:55:02Z","updated_at":"2020-11-16T10:55:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"As an experiment I added this to your code:\r\n```\r\ndiff --git a/contrib/format-httpd/pom.xml b/contrib/format-httpd/pom.xml\r\nindex 10a9e35b4..02ae984ac 100644\r\n--- a/contrib/format-httpd/pom.xml\r\n+++ b/contrib/format-httpd/pom.xml\r\n@@ -51,6 +51,12 @@\r\n       </exclusions>\r\n     </dependency>\r\n \r\n+    <dependency>\r\n+      <groupId>nl.basjes.parse.useragent</groupId>\r\n+      <artifactId>yauaa-logparser</artifactId>\r\n+      <version>${yauaa.version}</version>\r\n+    </dependency>\r\n+\r\n     <!-- Test dependencies -->\r\n     <dependency>\r\n       <groupId>org.apache.drill.exec</groupId>\r\ndiff --git a/contrib/format-httpd/src/main/java/org/apache/drill/exec/store/httpd/HttpdParser.java b/contrib/format-httpd/src/main/java/org/apache/drill/exec/store/httpd/HttpdParser.java\r\nindex 326a074d1..8a0f23063 100644\r\n--- a/contrib/format-httpd/src/main/java/org/apache/drill/exec/store/httpd/HttpdParser.java\r\n+++ b/contrib/format-httpd/src/main/java/org/apache/drill/exec/store/httpd/HttpdParser.java\r\n@@ -17,6 +17,7 @@\r\n  */\r\n package org.apache.drill.exec.store.httpd;\r\n \r\n+import nl.basjes.parse.useragent.dissector.UserAgentDissector;\r\n import org.apache.drill.common.expression.SchemaPath;\r\n import org.apache.drill.common.types.TypeProtos;\r\n import org.apache.drill.common.types.TypeProtos.MinorType;\r\n@@ -67,6 +68,7 @@ public class HttpdParser {\r\n     } else {\r\n       this.parser = new HttpdLoglineParser<>(HttpdLogRecord.class, logFormat, timestampFormat);\r\n     }\r\n+    this.parser.addDissector(new UserAgentDissector());\r\n     this.requestedColumns = scan.getColumns();\r\n \r\n     if (timestampFormat != null && !timestampFormat.trim().isEmpty()) {\r\n@@ -119,6 +121,7 @@ public class HttpdParser {\r\n      * because this will be the slowest parsing path possible for the specified format.\r\n      */\r\n     Parser<Object> dummy = new HttpdLoglineParser<>(Object.class, logFormat);\r\n+    dummy.addDissector(new UserAgentDissector());\r\n     dummy.addParseTarget(String.class.getMethod(\"indexOf\", String.class), allParserPaths);\r\n \r\n     for (final Map.Entry<String, String> entry : requestedPaths.entrySet()) {\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow I ran into something strange.\r\nWhen I run this test code:\r\n```\r\n    String sql = \"SELECT `request_user-agent`, `request_user-agent_device__name`, `request_user-agent_agent__name__version__major` FROM cp.`httpd/hackers-access-small.httpd` LIMIT 1\";\r\n    RowSet results = client.queryBuilder().sql(sql).rowSet();\r\n    results.print();\r\n```\r\n\r\nI see this\r\n```\r\n#: `request_user-agent` VARCHAR, `request_user-agent_device__name` VARCHAR, `request_user-agent_agent__name__version__major` VARCHAR\r\n0: \"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1;

What should happen is that Drill will create a map of the parsed cookies and uri query.  If you don't think this is the most effective way of doing this, I'm definitely open to refactoring it.  \r\n\r\nJust as an FYI, I only chose to do it this way because that's how it was done in the original Drill/HTTPD integration.

So if you have a URL with params `field1` and `field2`, you'll get vectors (regardless of whether they are in a map or not) of `field1` and `field2`. \r\n\r\nNow, if the next record has `field2` and `field3` the result will be that the `field1` will be `null` for row2 but fields2 and 3 will be populated. \r\n\r\n> Note that the underlying parser does support this; the example for Apache Pig makes this the most clear:\r\n> https://github.com/nielsbasjes/logparser/blob/master/examples/apache-pig/src/main/pig/demo.pig#L34\r\n> \r\n> Now the response cookies are special because they have limited support for a wildcard in the middle:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> `response_cookies_$_comment` VARCHAR,\r\n> `response_cookies_$_domain` VARCHAR,\r\n> `response_cookies_$_expires` TIMESTAMP,\r\n> `response_cookies_$_path` VARCHAR,\r\n> `response_cookies_$_value` VARCHAR,\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> See https://github.com/nielsbasjes/logparser/blob/master/httpdlog/httpdlog-parser/src/test/java/nl/basjes/parse/httpdlog/ApacheHttpdLogParserTest.java#L161\r\n> \r\n> These are intended so you can ask for something like`STRING:response.cookies.jsessionid.path`\r\n> \r\n> Here I found that these seem to always return a null also.\r\n\r\nWhat I think you're getting at here is it might be advantageous to flatten the wildcard fields rather than putting them in a Drill map and in so doing, create many null columns.  Is that correct?  If so, my thought here is that the best way to go about that would be to add a config option called `flattenWildcardFields` and if the user selects that, you would get a column for every value in the wildcard fields rather than a map. \r\n\r\nThe advantage that I see in doing this is easier queries. For instance if you wanted to find particular values from a query string, you could do something like:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT <fields>\r\nFROM ...\r\nWHERE request_firstline_uri_query_aap = 1234\r\n```\r\n\r\nWould that work for you?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/731204034/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/736367332","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2112#issuecomment-736367332","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2112","id":736367332,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczNjM2NzMzMg==","user":{"login":"nielsbasjes","id":240096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDA5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/240096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes","html_url":"https://github.com/nielsbasjes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-01T09:58:33Z","updated_at":"2020-12-01T09:58:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm cool with what makes it work for Drill.\r\nDo note that if you have a LOT of query params and you only need a single won then putting them all into a map will have a impact on performance as all parameters are extracted, urldecoded and put into a map.

So if it says `LONG` as one of the options you can specify a setter that receives a `Long`. This is a property that differs per field, yet the old implementation in Drill used a single value for all fields. When this value is STRING it will all work, but when I sorted the fields this changed and it all fell apart.\r\n\r\nRemapping: \r\nThe logparser constructs a tree of dissectors based upon types like `STRING`, `TIME.EPOCH`, `IP` and `HTTP.USERAGENT`.\r\nA specific Dissector is capable of parsing a certain input type into one of more pieces which will have different types than the input.\r\nNow in my example the `request.firstline.uri.query.ua` is a `STRING` for which no Dissector exists. \r\nIn the logparser you can remap this to a different type like `HTTP.USERAGENT`. If you specify this the UserAgentDissector will automatically be attached and dissect this further into the parts it can produce.\r\nWhat I see in the Drill code is that there is an option to add a '#' (REMAPPING_FLAG) and then specify a new type and this is then used to call the remapping code of the logparser. Yet I have not found any tests or documentation that show how this must be used. \r\n\r\nI have an idea on how to make this possible.\r\n\r\nConfig option:\r\nIf you enable the useragent parser and then you do not ask for any fields from it the following happens.\r\n1) An instance of UserAgentDissector is created to see what can be parsed (takes about 1 second).\r\n2) If then no fields are asked from it this instance of the UserAgentDissector is simply removed from the parsing again. \r\nSo during the actually parsing run there is no performance impact, only during the startup phase.\r\n\r\nI'll improve this.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/741637555/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/741783736","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2123#issuecomment-741783736","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2123","id":741783736,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0MTc4MzczNg==","user":{"login":"cgivre","id":5513150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTMxNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5513150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre","html_url":"https://github.com/cgivre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-09T13:51:17Z","updated_at":"2020-12-09T13:51:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@luocooong \r\nThanks for updating the docs.

It's more of a demonstration of Netty jar up-gradation. As we tried to upgrade the Netty jar, we found there are many breaking changes that have been introduced. \r\nSo, the issue is not to resolve the conflict and merge the code. It's about how can we upgrade some jars that are being used in opensource code.\r\nWe have tried to upgrade from our end and modify the code accordingly. But, it didn't seem to work. If there is some suggestion on how to upgrade some of the jars used by open-source code or should we wait for the Netty jar up-gradation by the open-source community?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAlka","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/752885403/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/753733624","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2133#issuecomment-753733624","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2133","id":753733624,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1MzczMzYyNA==","user":{"login":"cgivre","id":5513150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTMxNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5513150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre","html_url":"https://github.com/cgivre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-04T03:08:47Z","updated_at":"2021-01-04T03:08:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> @cgivre The `To EVF` work needs these good ideas. Is it possible to add a comment for `openPossiblyCompressedStream()` function to describe the differences of them?\r\n\r\n@luocooong \r\nThanks for the review.   The `openPossiblyCompressedStream()` function opens an InputStream but if the file is compressed you can get a ZipCompressedStream or something like that.  In most cases, it won't matter, however, I found that in the case of a proprietary plugin that I was working on which read a byte array.  I'm not sure exactly why, but the Zip stream was breaking the reader.   The plugin in question also didn't work on S3 for the same reason.   \r\n\r\nI'm working on refactoring the LTSV plugin and was running into the same issue.   Hopefully this will make future development a little easier. \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/753733624/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/753733783","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2133#issuecomment-753733783","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2133","id":753733783,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1MzczMzc4Mw==","user":{"login":"cgivre","id":5513150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTMxNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5513150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre","html_url":"https://github.com/cgivre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-04T03:09:40Z","updated_at":"2021-01-04T03:09:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I can add a comment.
