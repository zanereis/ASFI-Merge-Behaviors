There will be no dependency on a build tool, it is a dependency on an external jar similar to any other external jar dependency.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/383101891/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/383118645","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1232#issuecomment-383118645","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1232","id":383118645,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MzExODY0NQ==","user":{"login":"vvysotskyi","id":20928429,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTI4NDI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20928429?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi","html_url":"https://github.com/vvysotskyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-20T14:42:36Z","updated_at":"2018-04-20T14:42:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@arina-ielchiieva, @parthchandra could you please take a look at this?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/383118645/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/383157678","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1227#issuecomment-383157678","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1227","id":383157678,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MzE1NzY3OA==","user":{"login":"ppadma","id":1904860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDQ4NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1904860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppadma","html_url":"https://github.com/ppadma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppadma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppadma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppadma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppadma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppadma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppadma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppadma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppadma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppadma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-20T16:54:59Z","updated_at":"2018-04-20T16:54:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Ben-Zvi Thanks a lot for the review. updated PR with review comments taken care of.

On probe side, I am using stats for each batch coming in and adjusting the output row count. So,  we can skip applying sizing for batches spilled from build side and continue to do what I am doing on the probe side.

Apache Drill is an Apache project that must work with other Apache projects such as Apache YARN. The Apache Drill DoY support is designed to work well with Apache YARN (and has a few special additions for MapR YARN's unique limitations.) It is important that the Apache DoY work well with the generic YARN. No harm in adding tweaks (such as this one) to work with vendor-specific limitations. But, the overriding concern is that the DoY feature be useful in Apache.

CPU is something that the user specifies in the DoY config file. That information is passed to YARN in container requests. This feature asks the user to modify the drill-env.sh file to enable cgroups to limit CPU. As a result, the user must specify the CPU limit in two places.\r\n\r\nDoY went to extreme lengths to unify memory configuration so it is set in one place. The assumption was that, since Apache YARN handles cgroups, we've also got unified CPU specification. But, in this \"side-car\" approach we don't. So, would be good to capture the CPU amount from the YARN config as explained earlier and use that to set the Drill cgroups env vars -- but only if some \"self-enforcing cgroup\" flag is enabled in the config (which can be done by default for the limited MapR YARN.)\r\n\r\nAlternatively, MapR users can be told to set the CPU limit twice: once in drill-env.sh, and another time in the YARN config. But, the numbers must match.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/384396359/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/384411761","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1225#issuecomment-384411761","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1225","id":384411761,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NDQxMTc2MQ==","user":{"login":"arina-ielchiieva","id":15086720,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDg2NzIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15086720?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva","html_url":"https://github.com/arina-ielchiieva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-25T19:48:12Z","updated_at":"2018-04-25T19:48:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@vrozov re-implemented using maven embedder.

There seem to be two problems. The original \"nested column\" issue is an artifact of the JDBC driver. In Drill, a Map (the thing that contains your nested column) is just a nested tuple. But, JDBC does not have the idea of a nested field, there is no way to ask, for, say \"myMap.ts\". All you can ask for is \"myMap\" if it is a Map. The Drill JDBC driver has to invent a value to return. It invents a Java map.\r\n\r\nFor JDBC, which does not support nested fields, you can project your field up to the top level just by naming it in the select clause:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT `t`.`context`.`date` as `context_date` ... FROM ... AS `t`;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe second problem that this PR seems to address is how dates are stored. Many tests have been changed to double-down on Drill's original sin: that generic dates (2015-04-15, say) are represented a a timestamp in UTC. But, if April 15 is your birthday, it is your birthday in all timezones. We don't say your birthday (or order date, or newspaper issue date or...) is one day in, say London and another day in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nDrill should have a \"Date\" type that is not associated with a timezone. But, we don't so we get tied up in the \"treat the local time zone as if it were UTC\" issue.\r\n\r\nThe original set of Drill types did have types to handle these, but they didn't quite make it into the final version. Also, this issue has been discussed (with some vigor) on the mailing list once or twice.\r\n\r\nOne flaw, that you seem to have spotted, is that if I read data on a server in one TZ, then display it on a client in another TZ, the dates and times are all messed up. The server reads dates in local TZ, then simply stores the ms value in a date. The client thinks that date is UTC and adjusts it to its own local TZ. All heck breaks loose.

For example, \"we have lunch at 11:30 AM\" applies regardless of TZ.\r\n* Timestamp: an absolute time relative to UTC.\r\n\r\nThen, functions can convert back and forth. Joda (and, in Java 8, the new Date/time classes) work this way.\r\n\r\nThis means that the many tests that were modified to turn a generic date into a timestamp are simply making the problem worse: we are saying that 2015-04-15 is midnight, April 15 in London, which is highly unexpected.\r\n\r\nBottom line: we've got two very difficult issues here: how to handle maps in JDBC and how to fix Drill's date/time types.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/384512202/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/384522954","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1184#issuecomment-384522954","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1184","id":384522954,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NDUyMjk1NA==","user":{"login":"paul-rogers","id":3248881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDg4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3248881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers","html_url":"https://github.com/paul-rogers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-26T06:00:15Z","updated_at":"2018-04-26T06:00:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"One additional note. We noted that JDBC does not support the idea of a nested tuple (a Drill \"map\".) JDBC does support columns that return a Java object. To bridge the gap, Drill returns a Map column as a Java object.\r\n\r\nBut, why a JSON object? The answer seems to lie with the `sqline` program. If we query a one-line JSON file with a nested object in `sqlline`, we get the following display:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT * FROM `json/nested.json`;\r\n+---------+----------------------------------+\r\n| custId  |               name               |\r\n+---------+----------------------------------+\r\n| 101     | {\"first\":\"John\",\"last\":\"Smith\"}  |\r\n+---------+----------------------------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, it seems likely that the the value of a Map object was translated to a JSON object so that when `sqlline` calls `toString()` on it, it ends up formatted nicely as above.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, it may be hard to change the kind of objects returned from JDBC for a Map column.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/384522954/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/384595332","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1232#issuecomment-384595332","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1232","id":384595332,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NDU5NTMzMg==","user":{"login":"arina-ielchiieva","id":15086720,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDg2NzIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15086720?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva","html_url":"https://github.com/arina-ielchiieva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-26T10:44:51Z","updated_at":"2018-04-26T10:44:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"LGTM.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/384595332/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/384678859","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1214#issuecomment-384678859","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1214","id":384678859,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NDY3ODg1OQ==","user":{"login":"arina-ielchiieva","id":15086720,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDg2NzIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15086720?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva","html_url":"https://github.com/arina-ielchiieva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-26T15:15:52Z","updated_at":"2018-04-26T15:15:52Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@parthchandra

 There are at least two issues.  \r\n\r\nOne is about how Drill represent Date, Time, Timestamp internally using a UTC based instant representation and fudges the timezone in order to make the none time zone fields looking right, that Paul outlined nicely above.  To really fix this, one would need to first define how Drill wishes to handle Date, Time, Timestamp: e.g. no time zone at all, time zone aware but not preserving, time zone aware and preserving, etc.  One can look at how databases handle time zones to get some inspirations.  This part is too ambitious for me to fix here.\r\n\r\nThe second is to obtain a complex object value from JDBC interface.  Drill doesn't make a JSON object in order to send the data to a JDBC interface.  It looks like the JDBC interface is simply an alternative accessor to vector data being transmitted from the server side to the client side.  Once the vector data arrives on the client side, the JDBC layer builds a Map (or List) object by reading the values from the vectors.  The issue I found was that inside this process, date|time|timestamp values from their respective vector classes were all read and then placed into the same Java class, hence losing its type information all together when the Java object is nested inside the Map|List.  For my use case, I am not trying to get the string representation, I am access Drill via the JDBC interface and need to see the Java objects returned.\r\n\r\nSo a fix for this part is simple (in concept), just use different Java types.  Except, when making this change, the first issue popped up as a complexity since one has to figure out how to make Date and Time out of UTC instant values.

It is even worse for ODBC which (last I checked) did not even have an API to return an Object type (which is why in ODBC we return a JSON string representation). \r\nFor Jiang-wu's use case, since the string representation is not enough, we might look at returning a java.sql.Struct [1] type for Maps and java.sql.Array [2] types.\r\n\r\n[1] https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/sql/Struct.html\r\n[2] https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/sql/Array.html\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/384745759/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/384747323","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1214#issuecomment-384747323","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1214","id":384747323,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NDc0NzMyMw==","user":{"login":"parthchandra","id":6529136,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MjkxMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6529136?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra","html_url":"https://github.com/parthchandra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-26T18:37:57Z","updated_at":"2018-04-26T18:37:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks Good.

I ran into most of the problems dealing with the timezones surrounding the data|time|timestamp.  java.sql.Struct and Array are interfaces and not actual classes.

You can just declare JsonStringHashMap implements Struct, and JsonStringArryaList implements Array.  \r\n\r\nNow the harder issue.  The semantics of \"date\", \"time\" are tricker comparing to \"timestamp\".  Timestamp is understood to be an instant in time (java/joda Instant class).  Timestamp is a single point in time and not impacted by time zones.\r\n\r\ndate and time can have two uses:\r\n\r\n1) logical date and time, which is not fixed point or range in time.  e.g. 2018-01-01 is the new year day and this day happens for a different 24 hour window depending on where your time zone is.  So this is a logical date, and we don't celebrate the start of the New Year day at the same time.\r\n\r\n2) date and time with offset/timezone -- This refers to a specific point or range in time.  This type of date/time is absolute.  e.g. NYSE opens on \"7:30 am EST\".

You celebrate it the same day regardless of where you are in the world. Same with an order date. So, a key problem is that, for dates, they are not relative to UTC, they are just dates. They become relative to UTC only when a time and timezone is supplied.\r\n\r\nAs @jiang-wu explained, storing in UTC is fine when times are absolute (date + time + tz). The problem is \"2018-04-15\" or even \"2018-04-15 3 PM\" is not an absolute: it is local and cannot be stored as UTC unless we know the TZ. Guessing that the TZ is that of the server really does not help, and actually produces wrong results when client and server timezones differ.\r\n\r\nThat's why the data structures need to support the data model @jiang-wu suggested:\r\n\r\n* Date without TZ\r\n* Time without a TZ\r\n* Date/time without TZ, and\r\n* Timestamp implied in UTC.\r\n\r\nAnd, yes, it is because people abused the Java `Date` class that the Joda time classes were invented. We just need to have Drill types that parallel the Joda types. Granted, this is more than this fix can tackle, but the point stands. \r\n\r\nAgreed that the issue of how to handle JDBC/ODBC needs to be resolved. Can we make up synthetic column names? Implicitly flatten the results so that \"context.date\" will pick out the \"date\" element within \"context\". This will allow JDBC to provide metadata and a reasonable type for each column, at the cost of potentially creating a very wide row (if you have deeply nested maps.) The \"auto-flatten\" option seems cleaner than any object-based format we make up.\r\n\r\nA related solution is to fix `sqlline` so that it has a formatter other than `toString()` as @jiang-wu suggested. We register a format class and `sqlline` uses that to format, say, a Drill Map. That way we don't have to use a JSON object so that its `toString()` produces nice output.

What do you mean by \"Json representation\"? Do you instead mean the \"Local[Date|Time]\" class representation?  There are no \"Json\" being returned from the JDBC layer.  It uses Java collections Map or List objects.  Inside the Map | List, the change in this pull request properly uses objects of different classes: Local [Date|Time|DateTime] to represent the various date/time/timestamp values.\r\n\r\nSo far so good.  Now, it is possible in the future, we may want to further translate the Local [Date|Time|DateTime] objects inside the Map|List to java.sql.[Date|Time|Timestamp] upon access.  But to do that inside the SqlAccessor, you would need to deep copy the Map|List and build another version with the date|time translated into java.sql.date|time.  That would seem like a lot of work for little gain. \r\n\r\nI would say let's hold off on that for now.  A few databases seem to be moving toward using non-timezone based representation in JDBC if the database does not support timezones: https://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/head/8-date-time.html  It would make sense to consider changing the class used after deciding on what to do with Drill handling of timezones.\r\n\r\nI am almost done with the changes locally.

In your view, receivers are pass-through operators that get batches from fragment queue or some other queue and pass them to downstream. As there is no wait and no processing between getting a batch from fragment queue and passing it to the next operator, I don't see why a receiver needs to take the ownership.
