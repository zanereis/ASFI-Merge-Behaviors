sorry it took me so long to review. I wanted to review properly and give proper feedback to complement your hard (and very professional!) work here.\n\nSo,\n1. This makes sense. This is in-line with our .NETification spirit, and as far as we don't remove important functionality I'd say this makes sense and can be removed altogether - or changed to work in a way that makes sense.\n2. This makes sense as well. We took this approach in several other places in the code base. I agree the guideline here should be code readability / usability / fluidity.\n3. Using an Enum does make sense, and indeed better to wait for tests to stabilize.\n4. This might diverge from other places in our codebase. Why is it public API anyway? I can't really see anyone using it, except from people trying to customize the SimpleQueryParser - which is simplistic in it's nature. I'd say let's make it nullable and either accept it's a public API with not much expected usage, or hide it as non-public API. WDYT?\n5. From my familiarity with the Java code base, you pass a flag to enable a feature. I think it's just confusing test names, and then a bug somewhere. @uschindler can you confirm? I vaguely recall hitting this one before, will try to look into it too later this week.\n6. I will help here. Give me a few (more!) days.\n\nAwesome work dude, thanks very much. I'll leave the decision up to you whether to get this PR merged or still work on it a bit more until it stabilizes.

This branch is based off of #173 and contains all of its work (except your last commit which I reverted because it would have conflicted).\n\nThis branch is at a stable point - I fixed most of the bugs in it and there is only 1 failing test now. It is basically release-ready (at least for another pre-release).\n\nanalysis-work-2 is further along and includes everything in NightOwl888/analysis-work. It has over 800 passing tests (out of ~835). I was just trying to break this into smaller chunks for you to review, but if you would rather just grab it all at once, that is fine too. In that case analysis-work-2 is the branch to grab.\n\nI am now working on completing the Snowball namespace.

Why is it public API anyway? I can't really see anyone using it, except from people trying to customize the SimpleQueryParser - which is simplistic in it's nature. I'd say let's make it nullable and either accept it's a public API with not much expected usage, or hide it as non-public API. WDYT?\n\nWhat I meant was, it needs to pass the value through to the public API of another class (I don't recall which offhand). The other class (or classes?) doesn't accept a nullable as part of its public API, so to make it compatible (and do what the Java version does) it would also either need to be nullable, or there would need to be a \"guess\" at that point in the event it is null. I suppose I could try to figure out what the other class does in the event of a null and move that logic into this class, but that would mean moving business logic from one class into another.\n\nAnyway, can't rule out the possibility that those new flags are part of the problem causing those 9 failing tests.

The only sections yet remaining are `Collation` and `Analysis.Compound`. Nearly all tests have been ported and there are currently 42 failing out of 1384. However, I have run into a few snags. \n\nI have managed to make `Analysis.Hunspell` pass all of the tests for this Lucene version. However, when I started porting the `RunAllDictionaries` and `RunAllDictionaries2` tests (that use live data), it turns out that version 4.8.0 of Lucene doesn't work with the latest dictionaries because the dictionary format has changed.\n\nI think the simplest solution would be to upgrade just the Hunspell namespace to a more recent version of Lucene. I have BeyondCompare, so it is pretty simple to determine what the delta is and just port that part over. I wanted to run this by the team before going forward, and also get some opinions on whether the latest released version of Lucene is the appropriate point to upgrade to (this functionality doesn't appear to have changed much beyond what it takes to support newer dictionaries).\n\nAnother problem I ran into is that the OpenOffice dictionaries aren't available at the [location specified](https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/master/lucene/analysis/common/src/test/org/apache/lucene/analysis/hunspell/TestAllDictionaries.java#L35) (http://archive.services.openoffice.org/pub/mirror/OpenOffice.org/contrib/dictionaries/). As you can see here (http://archive.services.openoffice.org/pub/mirror/), the OpenOffice.org directory no longer exists. Any ideas where I can obtain them?\n\nOne other related matter is _where_ to actually put these files. In Java the binaries are not in the repository. So, should I add a line to .gitignore and use the `\\test-files\\analysis\\data\\thunderbirdDicts\\` directory as the point to look for them, or do you have another preference?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/241184100/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/241242179","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/180#issuecomment-241242179","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/180","id":241242179,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MTI0MjE3OQ==","user":{"login":"synhershko","id":212252,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjI1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/212252?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko","html_url":"https://github.com/synhershko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-21T06:54:44Z","updated_at":"2016-08-21T06:54:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Awesome, thanks!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/241242179/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/241333517","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/181#issuecomment-241333517","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/181","id":241333517,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MTMzMzUxNw==","user":{"login":"synhershko","id":212252,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjI1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/212252?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko","html_url":"https://github.com/synhershko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-22T07:26:43Z","updated_at":"2016-08-22T07:26:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Awesome, thanks!

I was going to keep looking into it today, however if you already have it fixed, perhaps I can pick something up off of your branch that you aren't working on?\n\nThanks!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/241465081/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/241477163","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/181#issuecomment-241477163","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/181","id":241477163,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MTQ3NzE2Mw==","user":{"login":"NightOwl888","id":1538288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzgyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1538288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888","html_url":"https://github.com/NightOwl888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-22T16:54:19Z","updated_at":"2016-08-22T16:54:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sure.

You might want to also check to make sure I didn't miss anything else.\n\nThere are also currently 45 failing tests out of about 1400. Most of the failing tests are in the Synonym and Th namespaces if you want to have a go at them.\n\nAdditionally, I haven't gone through the API to ensure the accessibility of fields and members is the same as it was in Java. Certain functionality, such as the Pattern namespace could use some more overloads to make them more .NET friendly (for example, passing regex's in as strings/regex options in addition to passing in pre-made Regex objects). I am sure there must be other tweaks to the API that need to be done, I was just giving this as an example.\n\nFYI - I am currently working on the Hunspell namespace - the rest is fair game.

I noticed that there is a reference to ICU4NET in the project, however that project only has the BreakIterator class ported. After looking through the [dev mailing list](http://apache.markmail.org/search/?q=ICU4NET#query:ICU4NET+page:1+mid:wklj554al772n53m+state:results), I found that it is still up in the air as to whether Lucene.NET should use ICU4NET or not.\n\nI was currently looking into the possibility of porting just a few of the classes from the ICU4J project. Doing a manual port of the classes needed for Lucene would allow there to be no C++ dependencies. Also, if there are plans to compile against .NET Core (which I have read that there is), then using ICU4NET is not going to be feasible as it is using C++ CLI, which only works on Windows against full .NET. There are some discussions about this in the mailing list [here](http://apache.markmail.org/search/?q=ICU4NET#query:ICU4NET+page:1+mid:ni5d2wvsoahrqmr5+state:results).\n\nHere is what I have done so far.

The most complicated part is working out how to use the culture in a .NET-centric way. I took a stab at it in [this commit](https://github.com/NightOwl888/lucenenet/commit/e6a037b2bb971b1015b2fc96eca663267df08273), which you can grab if you want a starting point.\n\nBTW - I took a look at your stuff and noticed you still have the Locale class in there. I have basically been using the System.Globalization.CultureInfo class as a direct replacement for Locale, although in .NET we normally set the locale on the current thread and then use it from there, so it might make more sense to just pick it up from the current context rather than affixing it to the class.\n\nAFAIK, ICU4NET is _only_ for supporting Thai. And I just got that part working in #182 (although I had to wrap the BreakIterator and add some functionality because it doesn't break on Thai/non-Thai combinations of characters like it does in Java). This seems like it will work for now.\n\nFrankly, I live in Thailand and can read and write Thai, but I am not even sure I will be able to take advantage of the Thai support in Lucene.Net. I read through some of those posts as well and from what I gather, this is supposed to be the interim solution to get Lucene.Net off the ground and at some later point we can port ICU. I don't really see any reason why a .NET core release couldn't just exclude Thai and the other classes that touch BreakIterator.\n\nBut I understand where you are coming from. It would be nice not to have any unmanaged code references, if possible. And if that is a priority for you, then go for it.\n\nDo note I have added pretty much all of the other missing Analysis.Common pieces/tests (other than collation and Analysis.Miscellaneous.PatternAnalyzer and its tests) in #182. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/242902258/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/242906624","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/182#issuecomment-242906624","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/182","id":242906624,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MjkwNjYyNA==","user":{"login":"NightOwl888","id":1538288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzgyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1538288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888","html_url":"https://github.com/NightOwl888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-27T09:21:23Z","updated_at":"2016-08-27T09:21:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ok, this is now down to 23 failing tests.\n\nThe 17 failing tests in Synonym are still really no closer to being solved. I went over the SynonymMap and SynonymFilter classes line by line 3x. Wherever the problem is, it is hidden well.\n\nAfter spending a whole day stepping through code, I finally found a clue - all of the failing tests are failing when the expected synonym input has a space in it. For example, TestMatching doesn't fail until [this line](https://github.com/NightOwl888/lucenenet/blob/analysis-bugz/src/Lucene.Net.Tests.Analysis.Common/Analysis/Synonym/TestSynonymMapFilter.cs#L875) when the first expected input is \"z x c v\". It is unclear how that is supposed to happen, though since the tokenizer makes \"z\" a separate token which causes the logic to exit out at that point without comparing \"z x\", \"z x c\", and \"z x c v\". I went online hunting for a clue, but only found [this question on SO](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17283100/lucene-synonym-filter-behavior) in which the poster is just as confused about it as I am.\n\nI also tried again at the 5 failing tests in the Compound namespace. I went over everything line by line. Then I tried stepping through the code. However, I don't have a clue what the code is supposed to do, only what the expected output is. In [this test](https://github.com/NightOwl888/lucenenet/blob/analysis-bugz/src/Lucene.Net.Tests.Analysis.Common/Analysis/Compound/TestCompoundWordTokenFilter.cs#L84), the first output succeeds. The second output is expected to be \"ba\". The first token [comes back as \"b\"](https://github.com/NightOwl888/lucenenet/blob/analysis-bugz/src/Lucene.Net.Analysis.Common/Analysis/Compound/hyphenation/HyphenationTree.cs#L414) (is that right?), it then looks up [TernaryTree.Find()](https://github.com/NightOwl888/lucenenet/blob/analysis-bugz/src/Lucene.Net.Analysis.Common/Analysis/Compound/hyphenation/HyphenationTree.cs#L415) and it maps to \"a\" (is that right?), it then puts it as the second letter of the word array (that seems right..?). The next letter is \"a\", it looks it up and comes back as \"z\"(is that right?) it adds it as the 3rd element in the array (now that can't be right, can it?), the next letters it looks up are \"r\" and \"j\".  The documentation is scarce. I really don't see any hope of solving this without running side-by-side with the Java Lucene to see where the paths diverge. Although, the most likely cause has something to do with replacing the SAX parser with XmlReader and the HyphenationTree isn't being populated right. But, it is difficult to know what \"right\" is, since there are no tests on the HyphenationTree itself.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/242906624/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/242908502","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/181#issuecomment-242908502","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/181","id":242908502,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MjkwODUwMg==","user":{"login":"NightOwl888","id":1538288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzgyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1538288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888","html_url":"https://github.com/NightOwl888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-27T10:07:55Z","updated_at":"2016-08-27T10:07:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I am pulling down your work on Collation so I can work with it.

That should eliminate a lot of types from being considered.\n\nI did a quick search and the NamedSPILoader and AnalysisSPILoader are the only 2 classes that use the SPIClassIterator in lucene, so it should be safe to do this.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/243397693/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/243956566","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/183#issuecomment-243956566","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/183","id":243956566,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0Mzk1NjU2Ng==","user":{"login":"conniey","id":10136526,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2NTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10136526?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/conniey","html_url":"https://github.com/conniey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conniey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conniey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conniey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conniey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conniey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conniey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conniey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conniey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conniey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-01T02:11:08Z","updated_at":"2016-09-01T02:11:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@NightOwl888 I updated the [iterator to filter](https://github.com/conniey/lucenenet/blob/5611f70455199a97e3b7180300d356612f07a97e/src/Lucene.Net.Core/Util/SPIClassIterator.cs#L90-L108) for types with default constructors or `IDictionary<string,string>`.

The idea about mimicking the iterator by using yield return was pretty clever, but unfortunately won't work because it won't stop the outer loop when a stale key is hit. We need an iterator for it to work.\n\nUnfortunately, although the logic works on one thread (you can verify that by commenting [these lines](https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/blob/c67366fd4b383c31971a8ae68b458dec7aee2d7f/src/Lucene.Net.Tests/core/Util/TestWeakIdentityMap.cs#L286-L289)), when you hit it with multiple threads it blows up.

However, we are not inventing something new here, this is a port of an existing application and therefore must exhibit the same behavior. If you require a cache with different behavior than what is built-in, you can [implement your own ITaxonomyWriterCache](https://github.com/NightOwl888/lucenenet/blob/facet-bugz/src/Lucene.Net.Tests.Facet/Taxonomy/Directory/TestDirectoryTaxonomyWriter.cs#L275-L296). But without passing tests we are missing our mark for Lucene.Net.\n\nThe [documentation comments](https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/8fdf89690404c0e65784b2c5477552b9dec58591/lucene/facet/src/java/org/apache/lucene/facet/taxonomy/LRUHashMap.java#L24-L48) and supporting tests are very clear on how the LRUHashMap is supposed to behave. There is not supposed to be any bulk removal of elements, they are removed one by one as new elements are added. We only remove the _least recently accessed_ element. There are no expiration dates or number of accesses to contend with.\n\nI took a look at your implementation and it looks very similar to the original code that I changed to the current implementation. I am not sure why there is \"Usage\" being tracked in there, but it is certainly not something that is required to determine which element was _used least recently_. We don't really even need a date or timestamp for that - just an `int` counter would be enough. Also, we don't seem to be gaining anything from using ConcurrentDictionary since the only multi-step actions it supports are inadequate for LRU, so we would need locking anyway.\n\nBut my current implementation could also use some work. I think that it might work best to break this up into 2 or more internal data structures - perhaps one SortedSet and one Dictionary. I suspect that adding an item to an existing SortedSet in the right position is far more efficient than sorting a _whole_ set. Then when we come along to delete the _least recent_ item, it is simply a matter of getting the key of the item from the top of the SortedSet and using that key in Dictionary.Delete.\n\nPerhaps it could be smarter than that, too. There could be a queue and some internal worker thread that manages the updates as well as the deletes in the background, but I am not sure if that would pass our tests, since they need to see the changes immediately.\n\nAnyway, this is worth another pass, which is why I noted it above.\n\nBTW, if you _really_ want to thank me for doing this, please spend a weekend porting one of the remaining sections that doesn't have an open pull request. There are still a few sections that don't have any large library dependencies that would also need to be ported. Many of them were already ported in Lucene 3.0.3, which is a big help if you are stuck on trying to figure out how to make the pieces fit. We are almost there, but that doesn't mean we don't still need help!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/250434592/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/250459052","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/188#issuecomment-250459052","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/188","id":250459052,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MDQ1OTA1Mg==","user":{"login":"eladmarg","id":3823205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjMyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3823205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladmarg","html_url":"https://github.com/eladmarg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladmarg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladmarg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladmarg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladmarg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladmarg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladmarg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladmarg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladmarg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladmarg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-29T13:00:41Z","updated_at":"2016-09-29T13:00:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@NightOwl888

[Here is my branch](https://github.com/NightOwl888/lucenenet/tree/facet-lurch-table) showing it functioning.\n1. [NameIntCacheLRU was updated](https://github.com/NightOwl888/lucenenet/blob/facet-lurch-table/src/Lucene.Net.Facet/Taxonomy/WriterCache/NameIntCacheLRU.cs#L73) to use `LurchTable` for LRU, and it is now passing all of the concurrency tests.\n2. [LRUHashMap](https://github.com/NightOwl888/lucenenet/blob/facet-lurch-table/src/Lucene.Net.Facet/Taxonomy/LRUHashMap.cs) is now just an adapter around `LurchTable` so we get the right `Get` and `Put` behavior to match Java.\n3. [I added some unit tests](https://github.com/NightOwl888/lucenenet/blob/facet-lurch-table/src/Lucene.Net.Tests.Facet/Taxonomy/TestLRUHashMap.cs#L63-L67) to demonstrate that the `Put` behavior functions properly. Although it took some work to figure out out how to achieve it, it turned out to be [quite simple](https://github.com/NightOwl888/lucenenet/blob/facet-lurch-table/src/Lucene.Net.Facet/Taxonomy/LRUHashMap.cs#L80-L86) to mimic Java's behavior in a thread-safe way.\n\nHowever, there are a couple of issues:\n1. The `Limit` property is readonly, but [in Lucene it needs to be changed](https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/releases/lucene-solr/4.8.0/lucene/facet/src/java/org/apache/lucene/facet/taxonomy/directory/DirectoryTaxonomyReader.java#L330-L347) (increased) dynamically. So, for now I have it [throwing a `NotImplementedException`](https://github.com/NightOwl888/lucenenet/blob/facet-lurch-table/src/Lucene.Net.Facet/Taxonomy/LRUHashMap.cs#L69-L74).\n2. We are getting this Lucene.Net implementation to work on .NET core, and there is currently no support for it with `CSharpTest.Net.Collections`.\n\nThe first issue can be easily patched. We could ultimately go back to putting the locks into DirectoryTaxonomyReader to update that property safely.\n\nHowever, the second issue isn't something we can ignore. If there aren't too many dependencies, it might make the most sense to bring the code over into our Support namespace. \n\nIf not, our only option may be to fork it, patch it, rename it, and post it on NuGet since the code hasn't been touched in over 2 years, there was only 1 release, and it is not very likely we will be able to get the original owner to update it (although we should try that first). I don't imagine getting a set of data collections to work on .NET core will be too much of a challenge.\n\nStill, despite these issues, this is looking like our best option, because it is thread-safe.\n\nThe alternative would be to port `LinkedHashMap` from Java. While it is only ~750 lines of code, half of which are comments, its base class is `HashMap` and I am not sure how well it will fit with our current .NETified `HashMap` implementation (which doesn't have `Put` or `Get` methods). But even the author of the Lucene LRUHashMap [said it would be better if it were thread-safe rather than going this route](https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/releases/lucene-solr/4.8.0/lucene/facet/src/java/org/apache/lucene/facet/taxonomy/LRUHashMap.java#L42-L48).\n\n@synhershko - what are your thoughts on this?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/250956202/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/250957166","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/188#issuecomment-250957166","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/188","id":250957166,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MDk1NzE2Ng==","user":{"login":"eladmarg","id":3823205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjMyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3823205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladmarg","html_url":"https://github.com/eladmarg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladmarg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladmarg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladmarg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladmarg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladmarg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladmarg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladmarg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladmarg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladmarg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-02T06:54:40Z","updated_at":"2016-10-02T06:56:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@NightOwl888  this is fantastic news,\n\nthere are few files of the LurchTable, so all we need is @csharptest permission, and then we can just copy them to the solution and fork the relevant parts.\n\nI think if we'll contact @csharptest, he won't have any opposition.\nThe LurchTable is a tested and working solution already, so i think its better to use what's working.\n\n@synhershko is it possible to email @csharptest ?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/250957166/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/250964045","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/185#issuecomment-250964045","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/185","id":250964045,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MDk2NDA0NQ==","user":{"login":"synhershko","id":212252,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjI1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/212252?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko","html_url":"https://github.com/synhershko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-02T10:15:56Z","updated_at":"2016-10-02T10:15:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"At some point I looked at WeakDictionary as a replacement but didn't go forward with it because of some behavior mismatch.

Once we see a lot of usage, we may reconsider the implementation. WDYT?\n\nIn that case this is ready to go. But if we can spend 2-3 hours copying over an existing implementation that is almost a drop-in replacement for what we need, why not do one better?\n\nPersonally, I have a stake in faceted search - heck I have a whole open source project [BoboBrowse.Net](https://github.com/NightOwl888/BoboBrowse.Net), and I would like to have alternatives.\n\nAlso, Facet and Suggest are both brand new things to Lucene.Net. If you want to sway people's attention to this project, give them features they don't already have in Lucene.Net 3.0.3 (and make them as good as they can be). I have seen a few questions on the user mailing list from people who were trying to get this to work. Why not give them something useful?\n\n> Let's have this discussion in the dev@ mailing list please. The list Shad provided may be correct, but our priorities are different - the spatial module needs work, and there are still failing tests at core. We can also skip Analysis.Kuromoji and Analysis.SmartCNand completely now - they aren't worth our efforts now. So, Let's have that discussion in the right place so other people could chime in as well.\n\nActually, I am nearly done with Analysis.Stempel now. I know it is not that critical, but it looked to be less than a day of work to finish and I started it before I knew whether these pull requests were going to be merged.\n\nAlso, nearly all of the \"failures\" in the core are due to the test runners screwing up. Many tests are in abstract classes that are meant to be run for multiple test subclasses. Those subclasses provide the setup that is necessary for the tests to run successfully. But, depending on what test runner you use, they are either being run without the setup _and_ are being skipped or are being run _one additional time_ in the abstract class without any setup, causing them to fail in the out-of-context run.\n\nI know @conniey is currently working on setting up xUnit and I am hoping that its test runner(s) and/or specialized attributes are also a fix for this issue. If not, we need to find another solution that works regardless of the test runner used. The only thing I have come up with so far is to make those tests virtual, override them in the sub classes and only put the `[Test]` attribute on the stub methods in the sub classes, not in the abstract class. In fact, I did that in the Suggest tests before I realized how widespread this issue is (and that it also affects the QueryParser tests). It works, but creates a lot of duplicate stub methods that do nothing but call their base class.\n\nAnd yes, I will continue this on the mailing list...\n\n> On that note, @NightOwl888 I have no idea where you are located, but if I happen to be in your neighborhood during my travels do let me know and I'll buy you beers.\n\nI am in Jomtien Beach, Thailand.

If you have a text comparison tool like [Beyond Compare](http://www.scootersoftware.com/) (a free trial is available here(http://download.cnet.com/Beyond-Compare/3000-2242_4-10015731.html)) and some help from Git, you can easily determine the lines that have _changed_ between the 2 versions and only port those lines into spatial4n.\n\nI used the following procedure to upgrade BoboBrowse.Net. A project that took 3 weeks to port, took only 2 days to upgrade.\n1. Clone the spatial4j repo (note it helps to name the folder the version that you will checkout).\n2. Copy the whole spatial4j repo and all of its folders into another folder (note it helps to name the folder the version that you will checkout).\n3. In one copy, checkout the original branch (in Java) that this is based on. \n4. In the other, check out the branch that we are porting to.\n5. Using explorer, find all of the files that no longer exist in the new version and in the .NET version, move them into a folder outside of the repository folder (they may come in handy for code that moved from one class to another).\n6. Using explorer, right click on a file in the old Java version, and click \"`select left file for compare`\".\n7. Using explorer, go to the folder with the updated Java version and on the same file, right click and select \"`compare to <filename>`\".\n8. Filter out all of the unimportant changes (line breaks and comments) in Beyond Compare and port only the diff of the two into the corresponding file in spatial4n.\n9. Remove the unimportant differences filter, and choose \"*\" to view the entire file and go back through to get the latest documentation comments and change them in spatial4n accordingly.\n10. Repeat 6-9 for each file.\n11. In explorer, locate all of the _new_ files that didn't exist in the old version and port them to spatial4n.\n\nLet us know if you will be working on this - I was thinking about taking it up after working on the failing tests in Lucene.Net and missing tests in Lucene.Net.Codecs.\n\n@synhershko - You should also seriously consider using this approach to get to the next version of Lucene.Net after 4.8.0 is released.

Whitespace differences (different number of tabs/spaces, different line break chars, etc)\n2. Different code formatting\n\nBeyond Compare is great because it gives you the ability to ignore whitespace and even code comments. I am not sure if it has an API that can be utilized, though.\n\nLet's say version 1 in Java has this function signature:\n\n``` java\npublic int Foo(string arg1, string arg2, string arg3, string arg4, string arg5, string arg6, string arg7)\n{\n    return doSomething(string arg1, string arg2, string arg3, string arg4, string arg5, string arg6, string arg7);\n}\n```\n\nThen for version 2, someone decided the code format should change to:\n\n``` java\npublic int Foo(string arg1, string arg2, \n    string arg3, string arg4, \n    string arg5, string arg6, string arg7)\n{\n    return doSomething(string arg1, string arg2, \n        string arg3, string arg4, \n        string arg5, string arg6, string arg7);\n}\n```\n\nIf your diff tool isn't smart enough to understand code formatting, it will see this as a new function even though it is functionally equivalent.\n\nMost diff tools are only smart enough to work line by line. That is why I like Beyond Compare because it can at least tell you _which characters_ on the line changed and ignore trivial things such as tabs and spaces. Unfortunately, it isn't smart enough to detect code formatting changes, though (which would have cut about half of the time off of the BoboBrowse.Net port) - or maybe it is and I haven't found the setting for it... The main issue there was that someone decided that all of the opening curly braces `{` should be on the same line as the function header instead of the line after.\n\nI am not saying this is something that can't (or shouldn't) be automated, but to ensure it works properly you should make the tool smart enough to know when two different formats of the same Java code are functionally identical - otherwise you have copied a lot of useless code into the .NET part that will need a lot of manual cleanup.\n\nOf course, then there is also the matter of having the tool figure out _where_ in the .NET code it should insert the function, since we will have completely different file headers and the functions will probably have different bodies, possibly different method accessibility, slightly different parameter types, different code formatting, possibly different function names, Java getters and setters that were made into .NET properties, etc.\n\nIf it just spit out the diffs into a new directory of files that could then be manually copied/ported into the .NET part you would have the best balance of automation vs manual cleanup. Maybe you could go a step further and automate the process of removing the files from .NET (and backing them up somewhere) that have been deleted in Java and creating new `.cs` files for the corresponding new files in Java (and maybe even porting the code using one of the existing automated porting tools).\n\n@nazjunaid - thanks for the update.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/251645389/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/257823951","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/191#issuecomment-257823951","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/191","id":257823951,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NzgyMzk1MQ==","user":{"login":"NightOwl888","id":1538288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzgyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1538288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888","html_url":"https://github.com/NightOwl888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-02T10:14:11Z","updated_at":"2016-11-02T10:14:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"FYI - There are 2 branches that still need to be integrated before this is up to date with master:\n- https://github.com/NightOwl888/lucenenet/tree/core-tests\n- https://github.com/NightOwl888/lucenenet/tree/analysis-stempel\n\nBut neither of those affects the `Lucene.Net.Analysis.Common` or the `Lucene.Net.Expressions` tests, so you are doing the right thing by finding those problems first.\n\nThe core-tests branch adds ~120 missing tests and has several dozen bug fixes (including fixing the 2 failing tests in `Lucene.Net.Queries` and 32 failing tests in `Lucene.Net.QueryParser`). The tests in `Lucene.Net.Tests` are now 100% complete (including parts of tests that were previously commented out, but excluding tests that only apply to JRE/JUnit).\n\n# Test Context\n\nThe test context issues have been \"fixed\" by creating stub methods to put the `[Test]` attribute on in the subclasses where the tests are supposed to be run. You probably already know that part, but there have been some additions and the new commit where these can be reverted (if needed) is: 4dbc3590361814d13fae64c8d030820eb4987489\n\nThat is, if xUnit properly pulls the base class tests into the right context (if or when it is put in place), this commit can be reverted to rollback those test method stubs.\n\n# LuceneNetSpecificAttribute\n\nI added an attribute to apply to tests that were added as part of the port so they can be filtered (and compared with) the tests from Java Lucene. The filter can be applied in Visual Studio as `trait:LUCENENET`.\n\n# SuppressCodecsAttribute\n\nFixed this attribute to accept an array of strings and added the correct suppressions to all of the tests in `Lucene.Net.Core`. We still need to fix the Test Framework to randomize codecs and utilize this attribute to filter them.\n\n# ChangeNotes\n\nI noticed you have begun [listing some of the questions you have and unfinished tasks](https://github.com/conniey/lucenenet/blob/netcoremigration/src/Lucene.Net.Core/ChangeNotes.txt) about certain areas of the project and I know a few of the answers and have some comments as well.\n\n> TODO: Confirm HashMap emulates java properly\n\nAlthough these already seem to be doing the job (tests are passing), we could raise confidence about this by porting some of the tests over from the JDK. I have already begun doing this for certain pieces that were ported from or are meant to emulate parts of Java.\n\n> TODO: Tests need to be written for WeakDictionary\n\nLooks like we [have some tests already](https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/blob/master/src/Lucene.Net.Tests/core/Support/TestWeakDictionary.cs) from Lucene.Net 3.0.3 that exist in the repo, but haven't yet been added to the project. I am not sure how well they match up against the JDK tests.\n\n> TODO: Tests need to be written for IdentityDictionary -> Verify behavior\n\nWe should probably move this into the Support namespace. AFAIK, the Support namespace is for pieces that need to be sourced from the JDK and/or close approximations to what is in the JDK that don't exist in the .NET framework. We can then port over the applicable tests for IdentityDictionary from the JDK to verify it works as expected.\n\n> ParallelReader - extra data types, using SortedDictionary in place of TreeMap.  Confirm compatibility.  Looks okay, .NET uses a r/b tree just like Java, and it seems to perform/behave just about the same.\n\nIn many cases `SortedDictionary` will function as a suitable replacement for `TreeMap`. The primary difference is that `TreeMap` allows duplicate keys, where `SortedDictionary` does not.\n\nThat said, it is unlikely any of the tests cover this scenario because they would have all been written under the assumption that duplicates are allowed (and therefore the functionality doesn't need to be tested per se, since it is already covered under JDK tests).\n\nIn `Lucene.Net.Grouping` (WIP), `TreeMap` is required to make it work. There is a suitable TreeMap in the [C5 library](https://github.com/sestoft/C5) (see [The Working Programmer - .NET Collections: Getting Started with C5](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/jj883961.aspx)), which seems to do the job. I have ported `TreeMap` over to our Support namespace along with `TreeDictionary` and several other dependencies (as well as the tests).\n\nDo note that C5 currently doesn't have .NET core support, but someone has recently made a pull request for it. So whether to integrate it into the Support namespace and get rid of the external dependency or reference it in specific places is a matter of preference.\n\n> FuzzyQuery - uses java.util.PriorityQueue<T>, which .net does not have.  Using SortedList<TKey, TVal> in it's place, which works, but a) isn't a perfect replacement (a SortedList<TKey, TVal> doesn't allow duplicate keys, which is what is sorted, where a PriorityQueue does) and b) it's likely slower than a PriorityQueue<T>. I can't tell if the PriorityQueue that is defined in Lucene.Net.Util would work in its place.\n\nThere are 2 different `PriorityQueue` types in Lucene.Net:\n- Lucene.Net.Util.PriorityQueue\n- Lucene.Net.Support.PriorityQueue\n\nThe one in the `Util` namespace is an exact match for the one in Lucene. The PriorityQueue in the `Support` namespace is intended to be an approximate match for `java.util.PriorityQueue` (it could use some tests to verify that, though).\n\nFuzzyQuery doesn't have a PriorityQueue, so you are likely referring to the wrong type where this issue exists.\n\n> Dispose needs to be implemented properly around the entire library.  IMO, that means that Close should be Obsoleted and the code in Close() moved to Dispose().\n\nAFAIK, `close()` is being universally replaced with `Dispose()` rather than dealing with the (confusing) redundancy. There are cases where it is required, though - for example, `TextWriter`. IMO, removing (where applicable) makes more sense than obsoleting the `Close()` method.\n\n> TODO: NamedThreadFactory.java - Is this needed?  What is it for, just for debugging?\n\nAFAIK, no it is not needed. It is used as a parameter to generate a concrete `ExecutorService` in Java. \n\n``` java\n    ExecutorService service = new ThreadPoolExecutor(4, 4, 0L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS,\n                                   new LinkedBlockingQueue<Runnable>(),\n                                   new NamedThreadFactory(\"TestIndexSearcher\"));\n```\n\nIt looks like someone has already worked out that `TaskScheduler` is the rough equivalent in .NET (not confirmed). In all places where this is utilized in the tests, `TaskScheduler.Default`, or the [`Lucene.Net.Support.LimitedConcurrencyLevelTaskScheduler`](https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/blob/master/src/Lucene.Net.Core/Support/LimitedConcurrencyLevelTaskScheduler.cs) (which I grabbed from MSDN) seems to work well enough to get the tests to pass.\n\nWhile we _could_ port the `ThreadPoolExecutor` from the JDK and make it a concrete `TaskScheduler` so we would have a place to utilize the `NamedThreadFactory`, it feels like that is a step away from .NETification rather than just allowing people to use the `TaskScheduler` natively. IMO, it makes more sense just to comment it out or remove the file from the project (but not from the repo - it would be best to keep the file around with comments explaining why it wasn't utilized).\n\n> TODO: LockStressTest.java - Not yet ported.\n> TODO: MMapDirectory.java - Port Issues\n> TODO: NIOFSDirectory.java - Port Issues\n\nThese are now ported and most of the bugs they had were addressed.\n\n## Additional Items to Add to the List\n\n**`AlreadyClosedException`** - In .NET, we already have an `ObjectDisposedException` so this is reinventing the wheel. The `IndexReader` and `IndexWriter` classes depend heavily on the right exception type being caught in order to provide the correct response. This may be an issue if a nested .NET type throws an `ObjectDisposedException` rather than the expected `AlreadyClosedException`. While we could partially address this by inheriting `ObjectDisposedException` from `AlreadyClosedException`, and always catch `ObjectDisposedException`, it still provides a window where consumers could incorrectly catch `AlreadyClosedException` and later be bitten by an uncaught `ObjectDisposedException`. We should probably just remove this type and use the native `ObjectDisposedException`.\n\n**`ICharSequence`** - Many types have replaced the use of `ICharSequence` with `string`. Its too bad that .NET doesn't have an equivalent interface as `ICharSequence` that is shared between `string` and `StringBuilder` that could be utilized. But using only `string` has limited the API to a certain extent. A few types within Lucene.Net implement `ICharSequence` (`CharTermAttribute`, `CharBlockArray`, `OpenStringBuilder`, `StringCharSequenceWrapper`). It could save a step to have overloads for `string`, `ICharSequence`, and `StringBuilder` in all places that were `ICharSequence` in Lucene rather than having to call `ToString()` on the latter two.\n\n---\n\nIs there anything I can do to help you get this up to date?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/257823951/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/258252865","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/192#issuecomment-258252865","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/192","id":258252865,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1ODI1Mjg2NQ==","user":{"login":"synhershko","id":212252,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjI1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/212252?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko","html_url":"https://github.com/synhershko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-03T19:44:33Z","updated_at":"2016-11-03T19:44:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi, thanks, but we are not maintaining 3.0.3 anymore at this point, all resources are geared towards the 4.8.0 release and you are welcome to try it out https://myget.org/gallery/lucene-net\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/258252865/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/258362030","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/192#issuecomment-258362030","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/192","id":258362030,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1ODM2MjAzMA==","user":{"login":"ecortese","id":6595457,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1OTU0NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6595457?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecortese","html_url":"https://github.com/ecortese","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecortese/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecortese/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecortese/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecortese/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecortese/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecortese/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecortese/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecortese/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecortese/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-04T07:31:58Z","updated_at":"2016-11-04T07:31:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi, ok it's clear.\nAnyway 3.0.3 branch is very largely used and referenced by other popular libraries (eg.
