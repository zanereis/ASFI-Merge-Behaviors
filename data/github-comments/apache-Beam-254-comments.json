@aviemzur.\r\n\r\nSome licensing comments:\r\n- Anything that is included in our jar should be relocated, so there's no classpath collision if some other dependency uses the same thing. On the high level, our jars shouldn't include any classes outside `org.apache.beam.<component>`, because everything is relocated.\r\n- There should be a corresponding `SurfaceTest` to make sure we are not relocating something that is on the API surface, hence making it impossible to relocate (this may already exist -- didn't check).\r\n- Janino copyright notice should to be copied into our NOTICE with text \"Parts of the software are licensed as\" phrasing.

Perhaps I'm unfamiliar with typical use cases of Tika, but I'd assume that the order of content in a document often matters, and when you're reading many documents (e.g. a few thousand PDFs), it matters which document the data came from. Is this usually not the case? (it is usually _not_ the case for the kind of stuff people parse with TextIO - log files, CSV files and alike - that's why such an API is acceptable for TextIO)\r\n\r\n**The \"non-blocking\" thing.** I still do not understand exactly what you're trying to accomplish by having two threads where one waits for the other to do all the work, instead of having one thread that does all the work. The amount of work done is the same either way, right? - you still need to read and parse all the files.\r\n\r\nAre you, perhaps, assuming that a runner will wait for a ParDo's `@ProcessElement` call (or a whole bundle) to complete before applying downstream ParDo's to results of the current call (and are you assuming that this is not the case for a `BoundedSource`?) This doesn't have to be the case, e.g. it's definitely not the case in the Dataflow runner: `c.output(element)` under the hood will recursively apply downstream ParDos until a GroupByKey (see fusion https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/service/dataflow-service-desc#fusion-optimization). \r\n\r\nAlternatively: Do you have experiments that show that your implementation provides a substantial performance improvement over the simple ParDo-based implementation?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/330396001/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/330425375","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3858#issuecomment-330425375","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3858","id":330425375,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMDQyNTM3NQ==","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-19T04:23:13Z","updated_at":"2017-09-19T04:23:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Run Dataflow ValidatesRunner","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/330425375/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/330479798","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3378#issuecomment-330479798","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3378","id":330479798,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMDQ3OTc5OA==","user":{"login":"sberyozkin","id":467639,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NzYzOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/467639?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sberyozkin","html_url":"https://github.com/sberyozkin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sberyozkin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sberyozkin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sberyozkin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sberyozkin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sberyozkin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sberyozkin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sberyozkin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sberyozkin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sberyozkin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-19T09:14:37Z","updated_at":"2017-09-19T09:14:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi, \r\nre the **typing of the transform result**: \r\nI think it is just the way I was writing the test, I was not sure how large or small the chunks reported by PDF/ODT parsers would be, so I was updating the test values bit by bit after the test failures till I got the test passing, you can see from the code that the chunks are added to the tail of the internal queue by the Tika content handler and collected from the start of the queue by the reader, the ordering of the data is maintained. \r\n\r\nre **the non-blocking thing**: \r\nyes, I was thinking yesterday, and in a way it is probably nearly the same (I was not assuming the ParDo would block till the whole file gets parsed). My thinking was, that decoupling the pipeline read from the actual parsing of the content would make the data chunks available faster to the pipeline (not yet backed up by the runs against the massive set of files - I just wanted to make this feature avail to the Tika and Beam communities - and then make it totally right).\r\nThe other useful thing with the current approach is that one can try to optimize around the size of the data chunks, for ex, given \"A feature\" text fragment, one parser may report it as a sequence of \"A\" and \"feature\" which might be noisy, so one can try to tune it to make sure only a \"A feature\" is reported, one of the tests shows it, and it would require ParDo do have its own state to make it work...\r\nPerhaps the right idea would be simply to avoid the polling (to min even the theoretical risk of losing the data) and simply block on the blocking queue - I believe Beam can heal itself if one of the pipelines blocks due to some parser going into some buggy spin, so that might be a good short-term compromise ? \r\nLet me send a summary to the dev list (as you suggested earlier), I guess indeed it can be made @Experimental till no concerns are left. \r\n   ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/330479798/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/330589687","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3861#issuecomment-330589687","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3861","id":330589687,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMDU4OTY4Nw==","user":{"login":"swegner","id":674021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NDAyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/674021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner","html_url":"https://github.com/swegner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-19T16:08:24Z","updated_at":"2017-09-19T16:08:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for this contribution.
