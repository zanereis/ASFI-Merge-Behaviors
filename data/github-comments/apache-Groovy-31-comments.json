While automatically creating the parent directories is in some ways super nice, it might also be surprising for folks familiar with current Java behavior. I think I prefer the `mkParentDirs` suggestion mentioned in the Jira issue, though I'd probably call it `createParentDirectories` these days to match the newer nio styling. Then it could also be used for `setBytes` and so on, not just `write`. What do you think about that suggestion and if you like the idea, would you feel up for altering the PR?\r\nSuggested methods to add:\r\n```\r\nFile ResourceGroovyMethods#createParentDirectories(File self)\r\nPath NioExtensions#createParentDirectories(Path self, FileAttribute<?>... attrs)\r\n```\r\nUsage:\r\n```\r\nfile.createParentDirectories().write(...)\r\npath.createParentDirectories().bytes = ...\r\n```\r\n@xaaria What do you think? Or if you want me to progress, just let me know.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/822236024/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/823911713","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/1566#issuecomment-823911713","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/1566","id":823911713,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyMzkxMTcxMw==","user":{"login":"paulk-asert","id":280016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MDAxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/280016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert","html_url":"https://github.com/paulk-asert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-21T09:15:33Z","updated_at":"2021-04-21T09:15:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Merged,
