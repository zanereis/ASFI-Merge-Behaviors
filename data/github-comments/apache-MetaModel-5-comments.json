is acceptable from me, but I think it would be better to separate \"parser\" from \"reader\" here. A reader is a stateful thing IMO - it has a pointer/cursor to some data that it is reading through and it is also closeable. The parsing part however can have a different scope or maybe even be completely stateless. So I would prefer if we make two different classes for it (the reader will probably use the parser, but not the other way around).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/221327239/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/221797097","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metamodel/pull/106#issuecomment-221797097","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/106","id":221797097,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMTc5NzA5Nw==","user":{"login":"albertostratio","id":7139146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMzkxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7139146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertostratio","html_url":"https://github.com/albertostratio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertostratio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertostratio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertostratio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertostratio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertostratio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertostratio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertostratio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertostratio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertostratio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-26T07:25:53Z","updated_at":"2016-05-26T07:25:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"OK to merge?
