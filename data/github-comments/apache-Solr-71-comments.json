If I want to run Gradle and the project on different Java versions.\r\n\r\nIn our scenario, if the system is configured with JDK 21, that version will be used to run all tasks for Solr and SolrJ. JDK 21 can generate class files with version 61 without issues. However, if we want SolrJ to compile only with JDK 17, Toolchain can accomplish that. Otherwise, the Java version used by Gradle will be applied globally.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2404958996/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2404966268","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2682#issuecomment-2404966268","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2682","id":2404966268,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6PWN98","user":{"login":"iamsanjay","id":6595915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1OTU5MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6595915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamsanjay","html_url":"https://github.com/iamsanjay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamsanjay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamsanjay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamsanjay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamsanjay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamsanjay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamsanjay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamsanjay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamsanjay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamsanjay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-10T12:33:19Z","updated_at":"2024-10-10T12:33:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"From Intellij docs:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/gradle.html#gradle_jvm\r\n\r\n> Language level: the language level settings are applied for a source root or for a module.
