The code in question is the task receiver, which processes tuples sent to a bolt.  It expects to see a list of tuples in a batch, not individual tuples. If an individual tuple showed up it would cause an exception like this.  There are a few places in the code where tuples are injected directly into a receiver queue, the tick tuple, and the metrics tick are the ones that come to mind, but all of them explicitly insert a list for the single tuple they put in.  There is also the possibility that something in the batching code is not handling one use case properly and not putting in a list, but without a reproducible use case it is really hard to tell.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612560130/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/153374899","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/842#issuecomment-153374899","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/842","id":153374899,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MzM3NDg5OQ==","user":{"login":"revans2","id":3441321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDEzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3441321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2","html_url":"https://github.com/revans2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-03T14:41:03Z","updated_at":"2015-11-03T14:41:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1

It is a dependency for an HttpServletFilter pulled over from Hadoop that can be added in after the fact.  When people try to look at storm dependencies they see that hadoop-auth is not used and they remove it.  Perhaps what we really need to do is to have a separate external package that pulls in the ui filter and all the dependencies it needs.  Then we can have simple instructions on how to configure the filter using either the </p>\n<div class=\"code panel\" style=\"border-width: 1px;\"><div class=\"codeContent panelContent\">\n<pre class=\"code-java\">${storm.home}/extlib-daemon</pre>\n</div></div>\n<p> directory or preferably the </p>\n<div class=\"code panel\" style=\"border-width: 1px;\"><div class=\"codeContent panelContent\">\n<pre class=\"code-java\">STORM_EXT_CLASSPATH_DAEMON</pre>\n</div></div>\n<p> environment variable and </p>\n<div class=\"code panel\" style=\"border-width: 1px;\"><div class=\"codeContent panelContent\">\n<pre class=\"code-java\">storm_env.ini</pre>\n</div></div>\n<p>.  This way it would not add an unnecessary dependency on the classpath for anyone, and it is properly packaged + documented as an official part of

String search:<br/>\n    In UI, user can search certain string, e.g., \"Exception\", in for a certain worker log.<br/>\n    This search can happen for both normal text log or rolled zip log files. In addition, user can specify the number of matches to show in the search result.<br/>\n    2. Deep search:<br/>\n    User can search for a string for a certain topology, which means the UI will try to search on all the supervisor nodes in a distributed way to find the matched string in all logs for this topology.<br/>\n    Then the matched results can be shown on the UI with url links, directing user to the certain logs on each supervisor node. This powerful feature is very helpful for users to find certain problematic supervisor nodes running this topology.</p>\n\n<p>    Also, the topology history REST API is added to give hints for the previously launched topology IDs for a certain user. And the html files, images files, js file, test resource files and unit tests are added for log search and its tests.</p>\n\n<p>You can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:</p>\n\n<p>    $ git pull <a href=\"https://github.com/zhuoliu/storm\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/zhuoliu/storm</a> 902</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/848.patch\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/848.patch</a></p>\n\n<p>To close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch<br/>\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:</p>\n\n<p>    This closes #848</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>commit 20db09cc5da62bd1b13e8c563e55f9e8e5103a4a<br/>\nAuthor: zhuol <zhuol@yahoo-inc.com><br/>\nDate:   2015-10-30T19:35:32Z</p>\n\n<p>    <span class=\"error\">&#91;YSTORM-902&#93;</span> log search, init commit</p>\n\n<p>commit ad64c5d94607ebaa696171c2f67cf7d3a621f5a1<br/>\nAuthor: zhuol <zhuol@yahoo-inc.com><br/>\nDate:   2015-11-02T02:06:00Z</p>\n\n<p>    Continue on logviewer search</p>\n\n<p>commit 04577758baee3258d2be4401f009e95658a17405<br/>\nAuthor: zhuol <zhuol@yahoo-inc.com><br/>\nDate:   2015-11-02T02:14:48Z</p>\n\n<p>    lv compile passed, to do html and then manual test, unit test</p>\n\n<p>commit 13194c612eb55a4d4254860172139878e46dee67<br/>\nAuthor: zhuol <zhuol@yahoo-inc.com><br/>\nDate:   2015-11-02T03:03:33Z</p>\n\n<p>    Add html image files</p>\n\n<p>commit dfb5e90852e221af6027df35d61c0951a6973ecc<br/>\nAuthor: zhuol <zhuol@yahoo-inc.com><br/>\nDate:   2015-11-02T19:41:21Z</p>\n\n<p>    Now able to search, except the magnifying lens stuff (related to topo history)</p>\n\n<p>commit ca24ea096adc37375e83febb105df5532a720d17<br/>\nAuthor: zhuol <zhuol@yahoo-inc.com><br/>\nDate:   2015-11-02T19:58:38Z</p>\n\n<p>    Support TopologyHistory (just a couple of topoId for a user)</p>\n\n<p>commit 4d1acbf7fb60d7a09fbb861fd5ef309638eca864<br/>\nAuthor: zhuol <zhuol@yahoo-inc.com><br/>\nDate:   2015-11-02T23:31:37Z</p>\n\n<p>    Debug, thrift, topo history, now working well for deep search.</p>\n\n<p>commit 90ef371aadc14585f6db785fc0058f0790136eb6<br/>\nAuthor: zhuol <zhuol@yahoo-inc.com><br/>\nDate:   2015-11-03T16:52:26Z</p>\n\n<p>    Unit test and add related resurces files</p>\n\n<hr />","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612573908/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/153427884","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/847#issuecomment-153427884","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/847","id":153427884,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MzQyNzg4NA==","user":{"login":"revans2","id":3441321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDEzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3441321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2","html_url":"https://github.com/revans2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-03T17:37:10Z","updated_at":"2015-11-03T17:37:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@zhuoliu yes sorry typo I had a Y in front of it.

I know you want to be careful about what gets merged in, and if you insist we will go through the IP clearance process, but if we can avoid it I really would prefer to do so.  We have not had any issues in the past with large commits, like when we contributed the security code to storm which followed essentially the same process as this code. On my end it is probably going to take longer than the 72 hour waiting period to track down the right people to get signatures and they will all ask me why we have to do this when my team has blanket approval to contribute to storm.\n\nLike I said if you insist on getting IP clearance we will do it, but all it is just going to do is add more pain for me which I really would like to avoid if I can.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/153448299/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612624586","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/5000#issuecomment-2612624586","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/5000","id":2612624586,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI2MjQ1ODY=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-03T18:39:10Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T14:11:13Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a
