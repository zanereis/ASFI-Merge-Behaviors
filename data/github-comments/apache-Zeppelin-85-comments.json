Currently in zeppelin there are two locations for storing these passwords - 1. shiro.ini for AD passwords and 2. interpreter.json for the rest of the data systems. These passwords are stored in clear text as of now. \n\n**Solution** - Encrypt the password and store in a file that can be read only at runtime, by zeppelin process to connect successfully. Question is where? Either on the zeppelin host system or hdfs where big-data users are akin to storing passwords. JCEKS is a java supported concept and has worked well for most users, and therefore can be used. Creating a .jceks file is possible on a host, \n`jceks://file/tmp/test.jceks`, whereas on HDFS the user may have to connect to hdfs and then create the file such as `jceks://hdfs@nn1.example.com/my/path/test.jceks`, when the password is being stored on hdfs. \n\nAt this point in time we have solved the problem for not storing passwords in Shiro.ini, which can be stored at the zeppelin host itself. However we have to improve this solution and make it work for the rest of the use cases and that's where Credential API comes into play. \n\nCredential API is a generic solution which allows users to create password files for both of the cases - on the host and hdfs. Needless to point out that this has been used across Knox, which is a good standard for security. \n\nPlease let me know if this makes sense, or if you have any more questions. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/241483752/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/241543510","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/928#issuecomment-241543510","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/928","id":241543510,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MTU0MzUxMA==","user":{"login":"rawkintrevo","id":5852441,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NTI0NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5852441?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rawkintrevo","html_url":"https://github.com/rawkintrevo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rawkintrevo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rawkintrevo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rawkintrevo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rawkintrevo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rawkintrevo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rawkintrevo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rawkintrevo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rawkintrevo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rawkintrevo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-22T20:41:54Z","updated_at":"2016-08-22T20:41:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"for what it's worth (probably not much) this passed travis CI on my branch- \n[https://travis-ci.org/rawkintrevo/incubator-zeppelin/builds/154183905](https://travis-ci.org/rawkintrevo/incubator-zeppelin/builds/154183905)\n\nFailing on profile 1, onClick in webserver hits time out (unrelated).\n[https://travis-ci.org/apache/zeppelin/jobs/154156408#L16359](https://travis-ci.org/apache/zeppelin/jobs/154156408#L16359)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/241543510/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/241598707","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1352#issuecomment-241598707","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1352","id":241598707,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MTU5ODcwNw==","user":{"login":"bustios","id":7907284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MDcyODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7907284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bustios","html_url":"https://github.com/bustios","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bustios/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bustios/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bustios/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bustios/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bustios/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bustios/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bustios/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bustios/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bustios/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-23T01:13:07Z","updated_at":"2016-08-23T01:13:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The [CI failure](https://s3.amazonaws.com/archive.travis-ci.org/jobs/154284590/log.txt) seems not to be related to this change.\n\n```\nINFO  [22:02:24,946][] org.apache.zeppelin.cassandra.CassandraInterpreter@:<clinit> Bootstrapping Cassandra Interpreter \nERROR [22:02:24,950][] org.apache.zeppelin.interpreter.Interpreter@:register Static initialization is deprecated.

The download button only converts existing JSON response retrieved from Zeppelin server and converted in to CSV format with UI button. You should look at which specific interpreter you are using. Most example set the max row to display for dataframe or result for 1000.\nFor example, [file](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/5afd7cacdb6ac35d19ebf63bac9f2d20298cfc5c/python/src/main/resources/interpreter-setting.json)\n\n``````\n[\n  {\n    \"group\": \"python\",\n    \"name\": \"python\",\n    \"className\": \"org.apache.zeppelin.python.PythonInterpreter\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"zeppelin.python\": {\n        \"envName\": null,\n        \"propertyName\": \"zeppelin.python\",\n        \"defaultValue\": \"python\",\n        \"description\": \"Python directory. It is set to python by default.(assume python is in your $PATH)\"\n      },\n      \"zeppelin.python.maxResult\": {\n        \"envName\": null,\n        \"propertyName\": \"zeppelin.python.maxResult\",\n        \"defaultValue\": \"1000\",\n        \"description\": \"Max number of dataframe rows to display.\"\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"group\": \"python\",\n    \"name\": \"sql\",\n    \"className\": \"org.apache.zeppelin.python.PythonInterpreterPandasSql\",\n    \"properties\": { }\n  }\n]```\n\nHowever, be aware of how many rows you are requesting. The more rows you request, the more memory it uses to build the JSON response and the longer it takes for the browser to do the file format conversion. \n\nI am not entirely sure how optimized is the JSON parsing and encoding library used by Zeppelin or what library it is. Based on what I have seen, it seems the default library and direct toString() conversion.\n``````\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/241718112/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/241728798","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1355#issuecomment-241728798","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1355","id":241728798,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MTcyODc5OA==","user":{"login":"AhyoungRyu","id":10060731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYwNzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10060731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu","html_url":"https://github.com/AhyoungRyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-23T13:24:40Z","updated_at":"2016-08-23T13:24:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM

non-publicly.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/242427252/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/242581553","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1364#issuecomment-242581553","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1364","id":242581553,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MjU4MTU1Mw==","user":{"login":"zjffdu","id":164491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu","html_url":"https://github.com/zjffdu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-25T23:49:08Z","updated_at":"2016-08-25T23:49:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"\\cc
