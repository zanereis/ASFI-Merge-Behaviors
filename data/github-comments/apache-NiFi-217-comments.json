I will incorporate that approach and include you as a co-author on the commit.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2414693743/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2414724298","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/9379#issuecomment-2414724298","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/9379","id":2414724298,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM6P7cTK","user":{"login":"dan-s1","id":8440116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NDAxMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8440116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1","html_url":"https://github.com/dan-s1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-15T18:27:07Z","updated_at":"2024-10-15T18:35:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@exceptionfactory With that change should we should also then improve what is returned by ExcelRecordReader on line 146.\r\nCurrently we return a `java.util.Date` with `cell.getDateCellValue()` but I think we should employ similar logic to determine if its a DATE/TIME then call `cell.getLocalDateTimeCellValue()` to return a `java.time.LocalDateTime`.\r\n\r\ne.g.\r\n```\r\ncase NUMERIC -> {\r\n                    if (DateUtil.isCellDateFormatted(cell)) {\r\n                        final double numericCellValue = cell.getNumericCellValue();\r\n                        final long roundedCellValue = (long) numericCellValue;\r\n                        if ((numericCellValue > 0 && numericCellValue < 1) || (roundedCellValue == numericCellValue)) {\r\n                            yield cell.getLocalDateTimeCellValue();\r\n                        } else {\r\n                            yield cell.getDateCellValue();\r\n                        }\r\n                    } else {\r\n                        yield cell.getNumericCellValue();\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2414724298/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2414736837","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/9379#issuecomment-2414736837","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/9379","id":2414736837,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM6P7fXF","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-15T18:34:00Z","updated_at":"2024-10-15T18:34:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> @exceptionfactory With that change should we should also then improve what is returned by ExcelRecordReader on line 146?

It may also require more significant refactoring, but I think keeping it in mind, in this particular change, is worth doing, so I recommend avoiding the switch to `BaseMetastoreCatalog`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2419300387/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2419383255","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/9395#issuecomment-2419383255","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/9395","id":2419383255,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM6QNNvX","user":{"login":"mark-bathori","id":57758037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NzU4MDM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57758037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-bathori","html_url":"https://github.com/mark-bathori","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-bathori/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-bathori/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-bathori/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-bathori/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-bathori/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-bathori/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-bathori/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-bathori/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-bathori/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-17T12:16:45Z","updated_at":"2024-10-17T12:16:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I just wanted to embed the closing part and stick with the  \"try-with-resources\"  auto close but maybe a finally block is the best option here.

Under ideal conditions (100B message size, nothing else running in NiFi), 1 batch size versus 25 did **160k versus 350k** (messages per 1 minute), so roughly double.  Under more real-world conditions (5KB message size, NiFi busy doing lots of things) 1 versus 25 batch size did **30k versus 300k**, which was more noticeable.  Super big batch size like 10,000 didn't perform much different than 25 in my environment.\r\n\r\nI even put a speedbump latency generator between activemq and nifi, but results were predictable.  Though it did seem like PublishJMS was more affected by latency than ConsumeJMS, I didn't dive deeper there.\r\n\r\n[edited - I remember my measurements were per minute, not per 5 mins]","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2423400073/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2424890630","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/9426#issuecomment-2424890630","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/9426","id":2424890630,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM6QiOUG","user":{"login":"EndzeitBegins","id":16666115,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjY2MTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16666115?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndzeitBegins","html_url":"https://github.com/EndzeitBegins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndzeitBegins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndzeitBegins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndzeitBegins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndzeitBegins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndzeitBegins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndzeitBegins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndzeitBegins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndzeitBegins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndzeitBegins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-20T12:09:36Z","updated_at":"2024-10-20T12:09:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks good, thank you for the adjustments @exceptionfactory. 👍🏻","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2424890630/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2426549131","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/9347#issuecomment-2426549131","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/9347","id":2426549131,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM6QojOL","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-21T12:35:54Z","updated_at":"2024-10-21T12:35:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> While this does solve the issue, I'm a bit conflicted on the current approach. Not only this could have a performance impact (we are likely going to not use the serialized form as often), but it also feels like the default should be to ignore the unknown fields when reading the record.\r\n> \r\n> If we consider the below scenario:\r\n> \r\n>     * GFF Processor, generating a JSON with 3 fields: `a`, `b`, and `c`\r\n> \r\n>     * ConvertRecord with JSON Reader / JSON Writer\r\n>       \r\n>       * JSON reader with a schema only specifying fields `a` and `b`\r\n>       * JSON writer with a schema specifying fields `a`, `b`, and `c` (`c` defaulting to `null`)\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> It feels like the expected result should be a JSON with the field `c` and a `null` value, because the reader would drop the field when reading the JSON and converting it into a record and pass it to the writer.\r\n> \r\n> If we agree on the above, then it may be easier to juste override `nextRecord()` in `AbstractJsonRowRecordReader` and default to `nextRecord(true, true)`.\r\n\r\nThanks for summarizing the options and highlighting this alternative approach @pvillard31.\r\n\r\nBased on your summary, I agree that changing the behavior of `nextRecord()` to set `dropUnknownFields` to `true` in `AbstractJsonRowRecordReader` seems like a better way forward.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2426549131/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2426881963","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/9427#issuecomment-2426881963","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/9427","id":2426881963,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM6Qp0er","user":{"login":"joewitt","id":3057465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTc0NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3057465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt","html_url":"https://github.com/joewitt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-21T14:39:14Z","updated_at":"2024-10-21T14:39:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"cant argue with how fast this happened!  saw the tika 3.0 announcement this weekend and planned to do this as well!

Other than that, it is true that the lists are mostly unused.\r\n\r\nIt seems like a good idea that failure messages might be logged somehow, or that non-zero successCount / failureCount could be added as FlowFile attributes.  I wish I had considered this during the original implementation.  It is also a great idea to expose the FlowFileResult as processor level bulletins.\r\n\r\nGiven the timing of this (pending releases), and depending on your availability, would you consider a two-phase approach here?  I could put up a simple PR to synchronize the lists, which would prevent the hang.

Removing a NAR completely is fine, in case someone needs it later, just picks the last available version and it most probably works with latest NiFi. No vulnerabilities in NiFi, this is a win-win deal for everyone. \r\nHowever this case is far more complex, leaving the NAR in NiFi but removing features used by members of the community, making their lives much more difficult. \r\n\r\nBy timining I mean:\r\n-Do we want to have it in 2.0? As this is behind a profile, doesn't get built into NiFi unless the user explicitly wants it, no vulnerability is introduced by default, on the other hand we release 2.0 with half-functioning Iceberg services.\r\n-Do we plan to merge it after 2.0? In this case we are not in a rush and we should do it properly (replacing the deprecated Hive 3 dependecy with Hive 4 libs, which should eliminate most of the security concerns raised here). I'm pretty sure some members of the community are happy to help in these activities, for eg @mark-bathori \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2441139502/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2441176748","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/9452#issuecomment-2441176748","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/9452","id":2441176748,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM6RgWas","user":{"login":"mark-bathori","id":57758037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NzU4MDM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57758037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-bathori","html_url":"https://github.com/mark-bathori","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-bathori/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-bathori/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-bathori/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-bathori/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-bathori/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-bathori/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-bathori/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-bathori/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-bathori/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-28T10:24:50Z","updated_at":"2024-10-28T10:24:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 on @arpadboda's opinion, Hive 3 support should be removed but doing this right before the release and removing the hive support from Iceberg could lead to confusion.\r\nAlso I'm happy to work on the Hive4 upgrade and testing.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2441176748/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2441373223","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/9452#issuecomment-2441373223","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/9452","id":2441373223,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM6RhGYn","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-28T11:53:35Z","updated_at":"2024-10-28T11:53:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the feedback @joewitt, @arpadboda, and @mark-bathori.\r\n\r\nRegarding removing a component versus removing a NAR, it is important to note that the `HiveCatalogService` is a separate Controller Service, distinct from the other implementations. Although the existing module layout placed this service together with the others, it could be repackaged in a separate NAR bundle for better isolation from the other implementations. From that perspective, I'm not quite following the concern regarding the complexity of removing a component versus removing a NAR.\r\n\r\nRegarding the timing, I realize that Hive 4 is fairly new and that the decision to declare Hive 3 EOL is also fairly recent. As we have an opportunity to provide a cleaner baseline for NiFi 2.0, that is the reason for raising this right now. We could revisit this after the NiFi 2.0 release, and consider this an acceptable change given that Hive 3 is no longer receiving updates. \r\n\r\nAnyone who needs Hive 3 Catalog support could continue to use the 2.0.0-M4 release version, with the understanding that it is not supported from either NiFi or Hive. I think there is actually more confusion from releasing the current version, because it implies support from the NiFi project, which we are not able to provide, given that Hive 3 is EOL.\r\n\r\n@mark-bathori Do you have a rough idea of what would be involved in implementing support for Hive 4?\r\n\r\n@arpadboda For clarification, if the current Hive 3 version of `HiveCatalogService` were in its own NAR, would you be in favor of removing it?
