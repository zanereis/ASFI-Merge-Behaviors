I must have misunderstood the purpose then, is the purpose of to use docker as a transportation mechanism for a tarball?

I'm not sure what the details of this are but effectively Aurora will take care of getting the docker image from the registry and inflating it, it will then configure the sandbox such that it's reachable from the executable that are in the docker image. Basically using this serves 2 purposes.\n1) It makes it so that fetching the topology tar doesn't rely on something like 'curl' or 'hdfs' being installed on the mesos slaves. Generally speaking making the slaves stupid enough to just use docker is the advice I've gotten for Aurora.\n2) It allows multiple instances of the job on the same machine to leverage the same docker image download preventing it from repeating downloads.\n\nAs part of 2 if you were to build a docker image with all the docker core libraries and set it as the base image in the uploader config Mesos/Aurora is smart enough to cache that base image on the executors which means that if you're running a number of different topologies they'll each only download the bits that make them different. I haven't explicitly configured things for this use case as I'm expecting that each user will end up wanting <their preferred linux distro> + <their required software> + <heron core

However I'm guessing it would be the addition of a \"CMD\" directive at the end of the Dockerfile basically saying what to run. Because the heron core binaries have to be compiled to the target system (Ubuntu, CentOs, etc.) you can't install those as part of creating this image without tying yourself to a specific distribution so you would need to rely on base image that was specified having them installed already. Additionally at the point when the uploader is invoked you don't know most of the information you need to actually run the topology (ie. Ram Map) so in practice what would be required is a CMD directive that looks a lot like the command_to_start_executor in the heron.aurora file, which is to say a lot of variables that can be specified. The scheduler would then need to specify things like the path to the Core binaries to the docker command so that they can be turned into environment variables.\n\nI like the idea of getting this Docker container to be executable but I think it's beyond the scope of this PR. Assuming that the base image on which this container is built includes the core binaries it's possible to take the output of this uploader and run it by specifying the executor binary to the docker run command.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/250209752/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/250309281","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1443#issuecomment-250309281","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1443","id":250309281,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MDMwOTI4MQ==","user":{"login":"maosongfu","id":3028698,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMjg2OTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3028698?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu","html_url":"https://github.com/maosongfu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-28T21:41:34Z","updated_at":"2016-09-28T21:41:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"#1445

Running locally I'm seeing the following failure:\n\n## exec ${PAGER:-/usr/bin/less} \"$0\" || exit 1\n\n============================= test session starts ==============================\nplatform darwin -- Python 2.7.11 -- py-1.4.27 -- pytest-2.6.4\nERROR: file not found: heron/statemgrs/tests/python/zkstatemanager_unittest.py\n\n===============================  in 0.00 seconds ===============================\n\nThe cause seems to be the script that is generated to run the unit tests as part of the Pex Test target which is:\nPYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 /private/var/tmp/_bazel_cpardy/9b99ba7514b33ef96b48f910b2c02c50/execroot/heron/bazel-out/local-fastbuild/bin/heron/statemgrs/tests/python/statemanager_unittest.pex /private/var/tmp/_bazel_cpardy/9b99ba7514b33ef96b48f910b2c02c50/execroot/heron/heron/statemgrs/tests/python/configloader_unittest.py heron/statemgrs/tests/python/zkstatemanager_unittest.py heron/statemgrs/tests/python/statemanagerfactory_unittest.py\n\nyou can see that the existing tests (configloader_unittest.py) has generated a path in the bazel build directory while my added unit tests have not. I'm not sure if I can get the logs on the CI server but I'm guessing there's a similar problem. \nIf I copy and paste the code above into my terminal and run it the result is passing tests, I also made the tests fail and verified that they do actually run. I dug through the pex rule and it doesn't seem to be doing anything that would treat my new tests differently. I'm guessing at this point that the problem is something with bazel itself. Any thoughts?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/250476808/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/250499578","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1443#issuecomment-250499578","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1443","id":250499578,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MDQ5OTU3OA==","user":{"login":"vbhavsar","id":412438,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjQzOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/412438?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vbhavsar","html_url":"https://github.com/vbhavsar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vbhavsar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vbhavsar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vbhavsar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vbhavsar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vbhavsar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vbhavsar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vbhavsar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vbhavsar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vbhavsar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-29T15:25:52Z","updated_at":"2016-09-29T15:26:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"That was super fast.
