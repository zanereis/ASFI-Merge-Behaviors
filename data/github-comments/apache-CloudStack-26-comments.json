@kishankavala,\n\nIf it doesn't match the content of rules.v4 perhaps the iptables-save is not being called when dhcpsrvr.\n\nBy adding the change you suggested the code on the CsAddress.py line 367 will be executed:\n\n```\n    if self.get_type() in [\"control\"]:\n        self.fw.append([\"filter\", \"\", \"-A FW_OUTBOUND -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\"])\n        self.fw.append([\"filter\", \"\", \"-A INPUT -i %s -p tcp -m tcp --dport 3922 -m state --state NEW -j ACCEPT\" % self.dev])\n```\n\nI can add the changes here and run tests before you create the PR, if that's okay with you.\n\nCheers,\nWilder\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/125889027/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/125890106","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/627#issuecomment-125890106","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/627","id":125890106,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyNTg5MDEwNg==","user":{"login":"kishankavala","id":11205932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjA1OTMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11205932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishankavala","html_url":"https://github.com/kishankavala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishankavala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishankavala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishankavala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishankavala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishankavala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishankavala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishankavala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishankavala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishankavala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-29T09:22:28Z","updated_at":"2015-07-29T09:22:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@wilderrodrigues
