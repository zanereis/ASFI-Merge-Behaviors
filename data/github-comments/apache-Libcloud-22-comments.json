When you spin up a GKE cluster, it provisions VMs with k8s pre-installed and exposes the k8s API endpoint. After the GKE cluster is up, you interact directly with the [k8s API](http://kubernetes.io/v1.1/api-ref.html) for deploying / managing apps (docker images) using native resources like Pods, ReplicationControllers, Services, etc. Interaction with the k8s API endpoint is done either with `kubectl` or REST. At no point do you interact directly with Docker.\n\nSo, in terms of what you have for CaaS so far, I'd say it fits very well with GKE w.r.t to cluster CRUD operations, but not so much w.r.t underlying kubernetes (e.g. `install_image` or `list_image`). I supposed you could implement `deploy_container` such that it would, for k8s, deploy the specified docker image inside of a k8s Pod and have many `ex_` params. But I'm not sure how this would work well with other k8s resources.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/169390930/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/169440600","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/666#issuecomment-169440600","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/666","id":169440600,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2OTQ0MDYwMA==","user":{"login":"tonybaloney","id":1532417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzI0MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1532417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney","html_url":"https://github.com/tonybaloney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-06T19:55:57Z","updated_at":"2016-01-06T19:55:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@erjohnso I seperated the class into 2 types.

I'm by no means a k8s expert, nor am I as well versed in public container / docker services as you are.\n\nWhile I think what you propose will work, my biggest worry (non-blocking!) is on Kubernetes users having to map resource primitives and methods to the CaaS driver's point of view.  A common deployment option for k8s is to use Google Container Engine (GKE) to spin up clusters. And I _do_ think GKE fits very well with the CaaS driver (same with ECS). But I do think the CaaS driver isn't as good a fit for k8s (especially within GKE).  For instance, you'd have `list_clusters` support listing k8s clusters if the connection points to GKE, but return a list of namespaces if the connection points to the k8s endpoint.  Having two separate concepts of 'clusters' in this context seems odd to me.\n\nI also feel the CaaS driver is not a good fit as a client library for k8s. I would suspect k8s users to look for methods like `create_pod`, `list_namespaces`, etc.  My two cents would be to either drop k8s from the CaaS driver, or clutter it up with a bunch of `ex_` methods that actually fit with k8s resources (which goes against your point-2 above).\n\nBut, please feel free to blaze ahead. As I said, I'm not expert, and I'm also not directly affiliated with the k8s team nor its community. Please consider my input as just another libcloud user. :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/172991966/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/173026681","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/666#issuecomment-173026681","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/666","id":173026681,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MzAyNjY4MQ==","user":{"login":"tonybaloney","id":1532417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzI0MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1532417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney","html_url":"https://github.com/tonybaloney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-19T23:50:48Z","updated_at":"2016-01-19T23:50:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@erjohnso I've marked the driver subject to change. I agree with your observations, of all the drivers k8s is the one I've lost the most sleep over.\n\nI've been trying to ask people who are using either GKE and ECS and see how they would use a k8s driver and what for. The common response is this:\n- We have ECS/GKE for production containers\n- We want to emulate some of that functionality locally because we have spare hardware, k8s gives us that\n- K8S would be a good solution but we don't want to tie ourselves to it's concepts because we want to use ECS/GKE\n  For that use case, this makes sense. But if you want to use k8s directly, I don't think you would use this driver.\n\nEither way, further community feedback would be ideal.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/173026681/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/174193384","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/673#issuecomment-174193384","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/673","id":174193384,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3NDE5MzM4NA==","user":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-23T15:22:21Z","updated_at":"2016-01-23T15:22:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@ryanm101
