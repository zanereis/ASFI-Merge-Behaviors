What has changed is that the standby serves the REST API and views instead of displaying a message that it does not have the lock, while it is waiting for the lock.\r\n\r\nThe sole purpose of the lock for the monitor is to support automatic forwarding to one, and only one, monitor with the out-of-box log configuration. Otherwise, the service registration would be a list instead of a singleton lock.\r\n\r\n@lstav and I discussed the possibility of adding a message to the log view only (instead of all pages, which the BasicServlet did) similar to the old message, so that a user won't be confused why no logs are showing up when they visit a standby monitor. That would only matter for the log view, because that's the only functionality that would differ between the active and standby monitors. However, I'm not sure whether or not that's the right thing to do, because a user may wish to configure a log appender to forward logs to all monitors, and such a message would only apply to our custom monitor appender, which discriminates in favor of the active monitor for log forwarding.\r\n\r\nTo summarize: the test should still check that HTTP is serving before acquiring the lock. However, the text of what it is looking for in the standby monitor may have changed. We could add a simple REST endpoint for the monitor to report its own status... and that could contain things like: active or standby, listening ports, listening interfaces, last master contact time, etc. That would make it easier to verify that the HTTP service is working, even when the lock has not yet been acquired.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/303796285/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/303798566","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/242#issuecomment-303798566","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/242","id":303798566,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMzc5ODU2Ng==","user":{"login":"joshelser","id":67863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3ODYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser","html_url":"https://github.com/joshelser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-24T17:42:45Z","updated_at":"2017-05-24T17:42:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> What has changed is that the standby serves the REST API and views instead of displaying a message that it does not have the lock, while it is waiting for the lock.\r\n\r\nAn old, standby monitor would return HTTP/503 (unavailable) to signify that it isn't polling data from the master and (thus) is useless to observe.

The 503 response code was added in ACCUMULO-4424 for 2.0.0, and has never been released, so this won't break anyone. The monitor has never fit into the same active/standby HA paradigm that applies to the other services, because its features do not require exclusivity. The active/standby single-instance situation for the monitor was only introduced for log receiving (so Accumulo could identify and automatically forward logs to the monitor), which introduced some kind of exclusivity (but for logs only). I believe we've made sufficient improvements to the log forwarding features, so that it's no longer necessary to impose exclusivity restrictions on all monitor features simply for log forwarding.\r\n\r\nWe can probably still do something to improve the way we inform users about log forwarding exclusivity. For example: we could provide `monitor.log.receiver={WITH_LOCK,ON,OFF}` (default: WITH_LOCK) config, and have the 503 response on the REST endpoint for logs, and display a message on the log view based on whether it receives 503 or 200 from the AJAX call.

I thought that's why I built that 503-response in the first place.\r\n\r\nI was always uncomfortable with the 503 on the whole thing when it only really mattered for the log forwarding. Even then, while I understood the convenience of configure-less detection of monitor location for log forwarding, I wasn't happy with the restriction. We can still do the 503, but I think we can make it more narrowly focused, to just the feature which require exclusivity (more specifically, when the user wants it to be exclusive). We now have a configure-less detection of monitor location for log forwarding which does not require this exclusivity behavior.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I would prefer to support multiple monitors, and I have a use case where log forwarding is disabled. I don't want to launch unusable secondary monitors which is only unusable to support a feature which I'm not using. For this reason, I was disappointed when Eric first introduced the \"active/standby\" to the monitor. I never thought this was a good idea, or a necessary one. Not enforcing this restriction actually makes the code simpler and supports more use cases.\r\n\r\n> But they still only go to one place, don't they?\r\n\r\nWith the default log4j configuration, yes.

First and foremost, no iterator will ever yield unless somebody explicitly writes an iterator that does.  Yields are never forced.  This is completely cooperative yielding.  If somebody writes an iterator that does yield, then the iterator should only yield if it is taking too much time between keys being returned.  In other words, if the iterator decides to yield often then it will suffer in overall performance.  There will only be an increase in RPC calls if the iterator yields when there are keys in the buffer, but we have not reached scan max memory.  Yes, long scans will continue to be long.

My old Operating System book calls this \"uncooperative yielding.\" But I can see how this can be confusing. Let's call it isolated yielding.\r\n\r\nTaking a quote from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_multitasking:\r\n\r\n> Cooperative multitasking, also known as non-preemptive multitasking, is a style of computer multitasking in which the operating system never initiates a context switch from a running process to another process. Instead, processes voluntarily yield control periodically or when idle in order to enable multiple applications to be run simultaneously.\r\n\r\nI believe this is (at least in part) the capability I am providing here, the ability for the scan (a process in some sense) to voluntarily yield control.  This is why I used the word cooperative.  Granted the scheduler in this case does not require all iterators to be able to yield so in that sense we have a mix of cooperative and preemptive/uncooperative multitasking.  I submit in that I am stretching the definition, so \"isolated yielding\" it is.\r\n\r\n> To your point that \"they do it to themselves.\" Well, since an iterator is one amongst a stack and you could have a multi-user system, if you had one iterator that would skip just five more keys before completing, but is pre-empted due to another iterator, you have the potential for a yield when one is not desired.\r\n\r\nOne iterator cannot pre-empt another unless the first iterator explicitly enables it to do so (see enableYielding(callback) on SKVI).  By enabling yielding on an iterator/source, then that iterator must be able to deal with that iterator yielding after any seek or next call.  That is part of the contract.  Note that the only way to actually yield the scan is for the top level iterator to do so.  No iterator is required to call enableYielding on the iterator below it.  The Tablet will only call enableYielding on the top level iterator.  Since the top level iterator may be the SourceSwitchingIterator, I made sure that it can handle this and passes this on to the next iterator below.\r\n\r\n> The only way to combat this would be solid metrics. You don't know how many increased RPC calls there are. This can increase RPCs if you simply set the key yield incorrectly. You don't know I/O load and how many keys being skipped is reasonable without these metrics. Further, one key is not the same as another key.

If you are going to put a limit and \"yield.\" You must have a cessation point. Agree that long running scans can happen, but the RPC increase and context switching is a problem that we cannot stop with the current solution. You also need a point at which you have yielded enough and thus must stop entirely.\r\n\r\nSounds like a reasonable feature.
