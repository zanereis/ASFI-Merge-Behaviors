It mainly consisted of sorting out and cleaning up licenses in our dep tree, as well as automating the process and preventing regression.  Also, well the release process is a bit clunky and hard to automate, especially the email crafting and voting part... Some of the steps have been recently documented here: https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/tree/master/RELEASING\r\n\r\nWe were told pretty clearly by ASF folks to **not** release to pypi or any other methods that don't align with the ASF process. Which is reasonable: if we want to be an ASF project, we should comply to the rules of the ASF. While the community and meritocracy in the project has been vocal about being/staying part of the ASF, people haven't been jumping to offer to work in that direction.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that crafting a clean-licensed ASF-stamped release is not easy, and it's not super sexy work, so that's why it's taking time.\r\n\r\nLuckily the project is super healthy in all metrics other than releases, and well I just kicked off a vote on general@incubator, so watch for the mailing list for a release, hopefully soon.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/522414927/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/522415890","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/8064#issuecomment-522415890","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/8064","id":522415890,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMjQxNTg5MA==","user":{"login":"issue-label-bot[bot]","id":48611044,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDg2MTEwNDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/27079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/issue-label-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-19T05:17:56Z","updated_at":"2019-08-19T05:17:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Issue Label Bot is not confident enough to auto-label this issue.

I'm sure we can work around this issue somehow, e.g. by disabling auto-limiting for non-ANSI DBs. However, I don't expect non-ANSI functionality to be as highly prioritized as ANSI SQL compliant syntax, i.e. expect some functionality in Superset to be less comprehensive for MSSQL than e.g. Postgres.

Looking into this, it turns out that the bug stems from the fact that MSSQL uses the non-ANSI TOP syntax for limiting row count (SQL Lab sticks on a limit on each query, which is currently causing this problem). I'm sure we can work around this issue somehow, e.g. by disabling auto-limiting for non-ANSI DBs.\r\n\r\nAFAIK, only SQL Server and Access use the `TOP` syntax and while Access is not commonly used anymore, SQL Server is still quite prevalent in \"Enterprise\" settings. This particular use-case should be handled because CTEs are a very mainstream and extremely useful feature to use.\r\n\r\n> However, I don't expect non-ANSI functionality to be as highly prioritized as ANSI SQL compliant syntax, i.e. expect some functionality in Superset to be less comprehensive for MSSQL than e.g. Postgres.\r\n\r\nI totally understand and agree with this. I avoid non-ANSI SQL functionality in any database like plague and lack of support for non-ANSI features in tools hasn't caused me any pain yet!\r\n\r\n> We'll be sure to add a warning in the docs for this once we establish to what extent non-standard syntax is supported.\r\n\r\nThat would be great!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/523192074/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/523200827","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/8058#issuecomment-523200827","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/8058","id":523200827,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMzIwMDgyNw==","user":{"login":"michellethomas","id":817955,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNzk1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/817955?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas","html_url":"https://github.com/michellethomas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-20T21:24:24Z","updated_at":"2019-08-20T21:24:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"thanks
