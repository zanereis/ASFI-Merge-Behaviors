An alternative take would be to delay termination until the barrier arrives back to complete the snapshot. The problem with that version, even though it's correct, is that under frequent checkpoint intervals the iteration head could potentially never terminate because it will always be in snapshotting state when the timeout occurs.\n\nRegarding the state snapshotting, should I switch to using the `ListState` representation instead or does it make no difference for the time being?\n\nWe anyway have to revisit the iteration implementation due to other pending problems such as backpressure deadlocks (see FLINK-2470). I guess this PR is just a first step towards improving them further.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/187825999/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/187827823","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1668#issuecomment-187827823","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1668","id":187827823,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4NzgyNzgyMw==","user":{"login":"gyfora","id":5880972,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODA5NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5880972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora","html_url":"https://github.com/gyfora","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-23T18:19:41Z","updated_at":"2016-02-23T18:19:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I can't really add anything to the timeout question :D \n\nAs for the snapshotting.

However, the giter8 template has the advantage that you can easily customize the project (selecting name, version, scala version, flink version, etc.). Moreover, it automatically retrieves the latest Flink version from Maven central. Thus, the template should not outdate if the API's aren't broken. Furthermore, I couldn't find another good tool which allows you to automatically create a project from a template.\n\nBut we can also change the order of the tabs so that cloning of the repo is the first choice if you think this is the better option.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/188265759/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/188268518","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1696#issuecomment-188268518","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1696","id":188268518,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4ODI2ODUxOA==","user":{"login":"vasia","id":498957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5ODk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/498957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia","html_url":"https://github.com/vasia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-24T14:05:21Z","updated_at":"2016-02-24T14:05:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've updated the PR.\nChanging the test to `TableProgramsTestBase` actually made the `TestCalcWithAggregation` test fail for `config=EFFICIENT` on a `ClassCastExcpetion` (`Tuple3` instead of `Row`).

Implicit conversions have no runtime cost, so maybe it would be better to just return the `DataSet` to make the code more compact and readable.

this PR looks good now. I'll go through the documentation more in detail when i unify the docs for this PR and #1640 when merging.\n\nFurthermore, I'd like to make a slight change as to how the sink is created. Although there will be 2 separate sinks providing different guarantees in terms of data consistency, it would be nice if the sink creation would go through the same mechanism.\n\n@rmetzger drafted the following when i had a chat with him:\n\n```\nCassandraSink sink = CassandraSink.addSink(input)\n    .setHostname(..) //passing the hostname separately is intended for simple programs\n    .setQuery(...)\n    .setConsistencyLevel(...) //decides which sink is used\n    .setClusterBuilder(new ClusterBuilder() { //optional, for maximum configurability\n        @Override\n        public Cluster createCluster(Cluster.Builder builder){\n            return builder.addContactPoint(host).build();\n        }\n    .otherStuff()\n    .build();\n```\n\nCassandraSink would be a wrapper class, exposing common methods a user would expect from a sink.\n\nIf you have no objections i would inject these changes while merging as well.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/189310673/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
