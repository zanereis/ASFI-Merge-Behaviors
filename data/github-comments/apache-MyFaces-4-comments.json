But I did\r\nnot want to omit the path from the other Github project into MyFaces, since\r\nit contains a self running version and a 2.3 jsf version. So I pull\r\nbasically per user command, not build command, the code via an NM package\r\nin and then copy the sources into MyFaces. The rest is a standard NPM\r\nWebPack build with all the needed dependencies triggered via the client\r\nplugin.\r\n\r\nThe final file then lands directly in the target folder, also the jsdoc\r\nprofile still is intact, it is now just not generated by our jsdoc\r\ngenerators anymore but the WebPack plugin.\r\n(mojarra seems to use the same engine, as it seems, given the html layout\r\nof the jsdoc specs)\r\n\r\nI guess apache has already some NPM caches in place, because we are not the\r\nfirst project to do so.\r\n\r\nAlso another thing, mapping files now work, but wont work out of the box\r\ngiven how they are loaded, following trick does it:\r\n\r\n<!-- Faces Servlet Mapping -->\r\n<servlet-mapping>\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n    <!-- enable the internal map files, we use a marker extension\r\ncalled mf_ap, the file itself ends with map -->\r\n    <!-- if you do not want to enable map files, simply remove this\r\nthe line with the mf_map mapping -->\r\n    <url-pattern>*.mf_map</url-pattern>\r\n\r\n</servlet-mapping>\r\n\r\nThis adds a special entry which then should load the mapping files, that\r\nway you can debug directly into the ts files if you want to.\r\nThats the reason, why i was able to kill the 5 different builds for\r\ndebugging.\r\n\r\nAlso if you look at my original Github project where it stems from theoretically we can produce a JSF j2.3 version and Faces 4.0 version from the same sources, there a small shims which reenable JSF 2.3 compatibility.\r\n\r\nWerner\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/comments/1262201933/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/comments/1265889727","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/myfaces/pull/325#issuecomment-1265889727","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/325","id":1265889727,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB-dSOs5Lc_G_","user":{"login":"volosied","id":5934310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MzQzMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5934310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied","html_url":"https://github.com/volosied","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-03T18:53:54Z","updated_at":"2022-10-03T18:53:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I will test some applications with these changes.
