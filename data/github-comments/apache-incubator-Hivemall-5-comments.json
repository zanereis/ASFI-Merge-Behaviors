case](https://github.com/takuti/incubator-hivemall/blob/709848d5626f0df7e7361511224e0e9284b3484d/core/src/test/java/hivemall/topicmodel/OnlineLDAModelTest.java#L147-L223) to [Python scikit-learn

sec** w/ approximately 30 iterations. By contrast, the Python implementation takes around **15 sec** for 30 iterations. Thus, even if `train_lda()` takes very long time for large-scale data, it should be natural. Hopefully, larger `-delta`, smaller `-iteration` or smaller `-eps` option could reduce running time (and end up w/ poor results).\r\n\r\n// Python code actually creates and handles a 20-by-62061 huge, sparse matrix. It might be unfair, but Java code alternatively has many inefficient Map and Array accesses.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-hivemall/issues/comments/295627983/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-hivemall/issues/comments/295709742","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-hivemall/pull/66#issuecomment-295709742","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-hivemall/issues/66","id":295709742,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NTcwOTc0Mg==","user":{"login":"myui","id":1163783,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM3ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1163783?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myui","html_url":"https://github.com/myui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myui/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-20T12:08:25Z","updated_at":"2017-04-20T12:08:25Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@takuti Merged w/ some refactoring.

implementation is based on: [Incremental Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis for\r\nAutomatic Question Recommendation](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b66e/c7faf2e4888503f7ad1537d284f350fb3e58.pdf), and this technique requires us to choose `alpha` as a hyper-parameter used in Eq. (22). However, choosing an appropriate value of `alpha` is difficult for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n- In the original formulation Eq. (22), `\\sum_w P(w|z)` does not seem to be 1.\r\n- Depending on data and `alpha`, perplexity highly fluctuates (i.e., not monotonically decreasing), and thus checking convergence based on perplexity is difficult.\r\n\r\nOne possible direction is to consider alternative incremental PLSA techniques. In particular, [Using Incremental PLSI for Threshold-Resilient Online Event Analysis](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a258/b33e285da2e93b59e50311d50ff46045a38b.pdf) is one of the most cited incremental PLSA papers.\r\n\r\nI still keep this PR as \"WIP\" for the reasons that I mentioned above.

Previous P(w|z) could be incorporated by setting a hyper-parameter `alpha` if we wanted (, and `alpha=0` is also possible). \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the latter requires to undergo certain fold-in procedure to compute \"better\" P(w|z) by setting a window size. IMO, this approach is too much complex to achieve our goal (=implement pLSA UDTF which repeats EM iterations over the same set of mini-batches).\r\n\r\nThus, I will finalize this PR with current implementation.\r\n\r\nTodo:\r\n\r\n- [x] Double-check if the algorithm is implemented correctly\r\n- [x] Documentation\r\n  - Difference with LDA\r\n  - Explain the effect of
