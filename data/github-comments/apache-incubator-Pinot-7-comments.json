not sure I really like how this state machine is represented in code form and it's pretty hard to follow, but I don't have any concrete suggestions on how to improve it. It might be more readable if the states were classes, but some states reuse a fair bit of code, so it would still be convoluted to follow.\n\nIt's good that there's lots of logging, but it's still the kind of thing I hope won't break in the middle of the night in an obscure fashion. We should add a diagram that explains the various phases. With Graphviz installed, this should give you a basic diagram:\n\n```\ndigraph segment_completion {\n    HOLDING -> COMMITTER_NOTIFIED;\n    HOLDING -> COMMITTER_DECIDED;\n    COMMITTER_DECIDED -> COMMITTER_NOTIFIED;\n    COMMITTER_DECIDED -> ABORTED;\n    COMMITTER_NOTIFIED -> ABORTED;\n    COMMITTER_UPLOADING -> ABORTED;\n    COMMITTER_UPLOADING -> COMMITTING;\n    COMMITTING -> COMMITTED;\n    COMMITTING -> ABORTED;\n    HOLDING -> ABORTED;\n    COMMITTER_NOTIFIED -> COMMITTER_UPLOADING [ label = \"Comment\"];\n}\n```\n\nYou can turn the diagram into an image with `dot -O -Tpng test.dot`\n\nI'll give this another pass when my brain is fully woken up later this morning.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/236620121/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/236635722","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/329#issuecomment-236635722","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/329","id":236635722,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNjYzNTcyMg==","user":{"login":"puneetjaiswal","id":1412516,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTI1MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1412516?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetjaiswal","html_url":"https://github.com/puneetjaiswal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetjaiswal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetjaiswal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetjaiswal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetjaiswal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetjaiswal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetjaiswal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetjaiswal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetjaiswal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetjaiswal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-01T16:40:27Z","updated_at":"2016-08-01T16:40:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/236635722/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/236700652","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/322#issuecomment-236700652","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/322","id":236700652,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNjcwMDY1Mg==","user":{"login":"jfim","id":246807,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjgwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246807?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfim","html_url":"https://github.com/jfim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-01T20:39:48Z","updated_at":"2016-08-01T20:39:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"LGTM,

Here is what I would prefer:\n\nA state actually does what it is named after (i.e. if it says it is trying to find a bootstrap server, it should be doing that without the need to call 'think'). Alternatively, the state can be named after its pre-condition, and an input can decide what that state does, and which state it goes to next. That would make the state machine more intuitive to understand, IMO. If you can make common methods out of error handlers, that will be great.\n\nPlease add unit tests in your final version, mocking kafka as needed (or, overriding it with a fake kafka). Best if unit tests can cover error conditions as well.\n\nIn order to support the segment completion protocols, the consumer should have methods like 'start consuming', 'stop consuming and give me the offset', 'catchup to consume upto this offset (exclusive)'. I think you are in the right direction to be able to add these methods, but just wanted to remind you. We can then build segment completion on top of the kafka consumer (and test the segment completion part with a fake kafka consumer wrapper!). The consumer code and the helix state machine code that has been validated is in https://github.com/linkedin/pinot/blob/LLConsumerPrototype/pinot-integration-tests/src/test/java/com/linkedin/pinot/validation/PartitionConsumer.java\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/237290157/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/237331022","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/339#issuecomment-237331022","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/339","id":237331022,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNzMzMTAyMg==","user":{"login":"puneetjaiswal","id":1412516,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTI1MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1412516?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetjaiswal","html_url":"https://github.com/puneetjaiswal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetjaiswal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetjaiswal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetjaiswal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetjaiswal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetjaiswal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetjaiswal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetjaiswal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetjaiswal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetjaiswal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-03T18:42:01Z","updated_at":"2016-08-03T18:42:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM.. please do the data conversions in the Resource layer itself.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/237331022/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/237347160","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/342#issuecomment-237347160","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/342","id":237347160,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNzM0NzE2MA==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-03T19:36:12Z","updated_at":"2016-08-03T19:36:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## [Current coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/linkedin/pinot/pull/342?src=pr) is 46.06% (diff: 100%)\n\n> No coverage report found for **master** at b6e7ea8.\n> \n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io?src=pr).

If no new data has been ingested and the system is stable (i.e. no zk notifications pending for segments, etc.), the HLC and LLC segments should come up with the same answer for a user query. There are edge conditions where these may not be the same, yes.\n2. By 'latency' you mean time taken in the external view change handler? Sure, there will be an impact since we have to build two routing tables. As long as extrenal view does not flap too quickly, the impact would not even be noticeable. Or, did you mean query latencies? There should be 0 impact to query latencies (all we do is one more hash table look up during transition phase).\n3. Do you mean memory stress in the broker or server? In the broker, the memory usage will be doubled (approximately) given that we are keeping both tables (in the transition phase). So, we should adjust heap size accordingly, especially on shared brokers. Or, not have multiple tables in transition on the same broker. On the server, again, memory will be doubled if we co-host the two segments, but not otherwise.

not sure how the state machine would work without having a method that's invoked periodically; there's no need to have multiple threads for this and I'd like to avoid synchronization between the Pinot code and some thread that's only there to make sure that on disconnections/connection establishment/leader re-election, we connect to the right node. If you have a good idea of how to make it work without that method and with no external thread, then I'm all ears.\n\nWith regards to the naming of the states, they do what the class is named for. Since there's no concurrent or asynchronous execution, the name of the state represents what is going to be done next (eg. if it's in connecting state, the next invocation of `think()` will do the actual connection).\n\nThere is no need to have the methods you have mentioned. All that this class does is process requests to consume between offset ranges and ensure that the client is connected to the appropriate Kafka broker for a given partition. The constructs that you have mentioned are something that should be handled in the Pinot realtime consumer, not the Kafka one. This class is only to separate the Kafka-specific details from the Pinot ones.\n\nWith regards to unit test, I'll see what I can do without having to create a Kafka consumer factory class and introduce additional complexity.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/238319120/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/238326581","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/356#issuecomment-238326581","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/356","id":238326581,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzODMyNjU4MQ==","user":{"login":"puneetjaiswal","id":1412516,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTI1MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1412516?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetjaiswal","html_url":"https://github.com/puneetjaiswal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetjaiswal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetjaiswal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetjaiswal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetjaiswal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetjaiswal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetjaiswal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetjaiswal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetjaiswal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetjaiswal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-08T18:12:04Z","updated_at":"2016-08-08T18:12:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/238326581/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/238359322","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/353#issuecomment-238359322","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/353","id":238359322,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzODM1OTMyMg==","user":{"login":"puneetjaiswal","id":1412516,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTI1MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1412516?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetjaiswal","html_url":"https://github.com/puneetjaiswal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetjaiswal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetjaiswal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetjaiswal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetjaiswal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetjaiswal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetjaiswal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetjaiswal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetjaiswal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetjaiswal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-08T20:03:44Z","updated_at":"2016-08-08T20:03:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I
