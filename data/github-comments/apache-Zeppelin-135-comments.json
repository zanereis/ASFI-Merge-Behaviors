Message location\r\n\r\nBecause of existing message `Results are limited by X.`  and `Output exceeds 10240. Truncated.` are displayed below the table. \r\nI think showing `Attention! Result is incomplete ...` below the table helps keep user experience more consistent.\r\n\r\n#### Message style\r\n\r\nBootstrap decoration is pretty. If we apply bootstrap alert to all 3 messages, then that means existing 2 message ux is changed, too.\r\n\r\nFrom taking less height of the screen, receiving less attention,\r\nTo taking more height of the screen, receiving more attention.\r\n\r\nSo which is the way we should go do you guys think? @tinkoff-dwh @1ambda \r\n\r\n#### Message text\r\n\r\nAll three message are different. \r\n\r\n`Results are limited by X.`\r\n`Output exceeds 10240. Truncated.`\r\n`Attention! Result is incomplete ...`\r\n\r\nIt'll be better use similar form of message. But how they're limited are all different. And it'll be great if we user give some link how they're limited.\r\nSo for example,\r\n\r\n`Output is truncated to X rows.

Just created hotfix patch #2154 to fix below two issues that you reported.\r\n - Select form is not shown up when multiple dynamic forms (e.g. 2 select forms / 1 checkbox + 1 selectform) are in one paragraph\r\n - Can't see `Run on selection change` menu under the paragraph control menu\r\n\r\nIt'll be appreciated if you can help me out to review #2154!\r\n\r\nBTW I tested all your test cases on my patch, most of them passed except `testMultipleDynamicFormsSameType`. It's because of [this line](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2141/files#diff-48409cf8ca5ddb1aea1a62ada3cd091dR649). The expected matcher should be `\"Howdy 1\\nHowdy \"` instead of `\"Howdy \\nHowdy \"` since the paragraph runs right after the selection has been changed. (as I said before :D)\r\n\r\nAnd after you rebased, some irrelevant commits are mixed and pushed together in here. Could you handle them?

Sadly i have no idea what could be the reason for your problem with limited information. But i think we need to focus on this hotfix patch in this PR comment. If you're still in trouble with your git env and you think you can't resolve it, then please [email me](mailto:ahyoungryu@apache.org). I'll be happy to help you :)\r\n\r\nAs I said in [this comment](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2154#issuecomment-287598706), would be better to merge this PR as a hotfix.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/287607416/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/287608907","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2135#issuecomment-287608907","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2135","id":287608907,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NzYwODkwNw==","user":{"login":"dlukyanov","id":7533327,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MzMzMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7533327?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlukyanov","html_url":"https://github.com/dlukyanov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlukyanov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlukyanov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlukyanov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlukyanov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlukyanov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlukyanov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlukyanov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlukyanov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlukyanov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-19T11:04:46Z","updated_at":"2017-03-19T11:04:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Leemoonsoo , is it possible to restart jenkins checks after travis succeed? \r\nI've never got travis success without restarting travis jobs manually.\r\nhttps://travis-ci.org/dlukyanov/zeppelin/builds","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/287608907/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/287618346","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2155#issuecomment-287618346","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2155","id":287618346,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NzYxODM0Ng==","user":{"login":"AhyoungRyu","id":10060731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYwNzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10060731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu","html_url":"https://github.com/AhyoungRyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-19T13:56:15Z","updated_at":"2017-03-19T13:56:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Tested both with & without this patch.
