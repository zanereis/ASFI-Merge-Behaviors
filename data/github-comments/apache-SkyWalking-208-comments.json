If CLI could trigger this, you actually build a CLI implementation to change every config server implementation. :) Such as ZooKeeper has its client CLI, which could do update natively. If the config server doesn't support it, it is the issue of their community.

It will help to debug and watch data locally. I uploaded this [pcapng file](https://github.com/apache/skywalking/files/5760438/dump.pcapng.zip), you can view the specific data by downloading the `Wireshark` software.\r\n\r\nThe metrics key in Zabbix follow this format: `keyName[params]`, for more specifications, please refer to https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/current/manual/config/items/item/key\r\n\r\nLet's take the key of `system.cpu.load[all,avg15]` as an example, and divide it into two parts: `Key Name` and `Parameter`:\r\n\r\n#### Key Name\r\nIn the above example, it is `system.cpu.load`.\r\nThe metrics key in Zabbix is not particularly compatible with our MAL. When MAL parses, it will consider `system` as a metric and cannot find the `cpu` property. Zabbix does not provide a similar formatting key function, such as `system.cpu.load -> system_cpu_load`.\r\n\r\nSo I thought of two ways to solve it:\r\n1. Users manually replace the \".\" with the \"_\" symbol when inputting expressions. In the above example, the expression of MAL must be manually replaced with `system_cpu_load`. When the backend receives the data and prepares to convert the MAL, it will also change the `.` -> `_` of the key in the metrics.\r\n2. The user does not need to change the name of the metrics, it is solved by extending the function of MAL. When MAL cannot find `SampleFamily`, a new `SampleFamilyFinder` is provided to solve it. In `SampleFamilyFinder`, it can be solved by implementing the `propertyMissing` method.\r\n\r\n#### Parameter\r\nIn the above example, it is `all,avg15`\r\n\r\nWe can convert it into the form of multiple tag values, and identify the index as a tag key. In the above data, it will become `{0: all, 1: avg15}`.\r\nAt this time, you can filter by `.tagEqual('0','all').tagEqual('1','avg15')` in MAL.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/753486437/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/753487751","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/6118#issuecomment-753487751","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/6118","id":753487751,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1MzQ4Nzc1MQ==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-02T15:36:55Z","updated_at":"2021-01-02T15:36:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"For MAL details, @hanahmily what do you think?
