The only concern I have is the flexibility for users to define a \"init\" function that gets called once before an operator starts processing tuples and a \"close\" or \"cleanup\" function that gets called when the topology is terminated.  I know flink has this functionality at least for maps and flapmaps and I found it useful when implementing the yahoo streaming benchmarks.  Perhaps we should at least have an \"init\" function that allows users to initialize certain things e.g. external clients or connections prior to actually processing any tuples.

I.e. for easy development and maintenance of sensors, all metrics providers must return the same `ComponentMetrics` structure. In this case (`BackPressureSensor.java#L90`), the sensor is querying `stmgr` component and `backpressure` metric. Accordingly it expects the metrics provider to return one metric in the provided component. However, the `metrics cache` is returning empty structures. This seems like a common issue and could be handled by `MetricsCacheMetricsProvider`. Instead of adding logic in all sensors to filter the empty structures, I would suggest fixing the `MetricsCacheMetricsProvider`. You are most familiar with the `MetricsCacheMetricsProvider` code.
