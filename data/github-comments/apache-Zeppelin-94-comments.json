The project is no longer actively maintained \n3) the SparkInterpreter class has changed a lot, probably a good idea to cherry-pick your changes and apply them instead of going through the complete rebase\n4) you've hard-coded the Spark/Cassandra connector dependency directly in `spark/pom.xml`. I'm not sure it's the cleanest way because people who don't use Cassandra still need to pull this dependency. Maybe it's better to create a separate Maven build profile for this. Until now it is done in `spark-dependencies/pom.xml` but since it will be removed soon by @AhyoungRyu (see https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1339) we'll need to find an alternative\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/249989480/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
