Reviewing the changes locally, everything looked good except for the `TestPutSQL` directory. I made some adjustments to that class using the `FileUtils.deleteDirectory` method for more reliable directory removal, since it remained after the test completed. This worked locally on Linux, so I will review the GitHub workflow build for Windows to confirm it works as expected. It may be necessary to do some additional Derby shutdown calls given Windows behavior, but if the builds pass, I will proceed with merging.\r\n\r\nI also noticed the `poifiles` directory as you mentioned in the description. It sounds like we may need to revisit this as a runtime setting, but that can be addressed separately.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2513023720/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2514896270","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/9560#issuecomment-2514896270","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/9560","id":2514896270,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM6V5kWO","user":{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-12-03T15:33:35Z","updated_at":"2024-12-03T15:33:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Great catch @NissimShiman! code change looks good, test looks good, +1 will merge to main","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2514896270/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2515016384","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/9554#issuecomment-2515016384","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/9554","id":2515016384,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM6V6BrA","user":{"login":"mark-bathori","id":57758037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NzU4MDM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57758037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-bathori","html_url":"https://github.com/mark-bathori","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-bathori/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-bathori/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-bathori/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-bathori/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-bathori/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-bathori/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-bathori/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-bathori/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-bathori/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-12-03T16:22:09Z","updated_at":"2024-12-03T16:22:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @krisztina-zsihovszki for the review.

The referenced PR https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/9288 changes the way component documentations are generated. From my understanding, earlier these documentations were somehow pre-generated during startup, but now it is loaded dynamically by the documentation view, using the NIFI REST API. Since this PR, when I add a Python processor, and open the doc view, basically only the name, version, and the relationships are shown. On the other hand, it works as expected for normal Java based processors. When I opened the browser's debug console I've spotted some error messages, when selecting any of the Python processors, that were referring to the missing 'tags' key from the API response. I have checked the endpoint manually, and compared the responses for Python and Java processors, and confirmed that some of the keys are missing in the former case. The Python processor had tags defined as well, but they were missing from the API response.

Thanks for working on these improvements @dan-s1. The changes are helpful in general, but the scope makes it rather difficult to review since it includes different types of changes that cover a number of vital classes.\r\n> \r\n> The initial removal of unnecessary generic types is straightforward, but replacing anonymous classes with lambdas impacts a large number of lines. For this reason, it would be helpful to break these changes into separate pull requests. One way to do this would be to back out changes in the `nifi-framework-bundle` from the current PR and handle them separately. Another way to do it would be to limit the types of changes. However, I think separating framework changes into a separate PR would help ensure sufficient review of more important components.\r\n> \r\n> These types of stylistic improvements are useful, and we should look at formalizing some of these changes using static analysis tools like PMD. However, for future reference, having a more narrow scope would help the review process and reduce the potential for missing important changes.\r\n\r\nI will separate the changes into two tickets.

One or two last things that I noticed.\r\n\r\nWhen validating a CSV Source Attribute, we can set the \"Validation Strategy = Line by line\".  When we do this, the flowfile content is replaced with the value of the CSV attribute.  This is clearly not good!  I cannot think of a use case where we want to allow \"Validation Strategy = Line by line\" on an attribute ... it should always validate the whole attribute and not change anything.\r\n\r\nWe can make the CSV Source Attribute depend on \"Validation Strategy = FlowFile\" but then we would have to defend ourselves from the case when someone enters a CSV Source Attribute and then changes the Validation Strategy.  The CSV Source Attribute will disappear and I'm worried that it will still be set and we will still try to use it.\r\n\r\nSo, if using dependsOn() gets too complicated, just add something to customValidate to disallow CSV Source Attribute with \"Validation Strategy = Line by line\"","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2555797145/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2557483291","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/8362#issuecomment-2557483291","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/8362","id":2557483291,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM6YcBkb","user":{"login":"Freedom9339","id":66659434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NjU5NDM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66659434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Freedom9339","html_url":"https://github.com/Freedom9339","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Freedom9339/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Freedom9339/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Freedom9339/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Freedom9339/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Freedom9339/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Freedom9339/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Freedom9339/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Freedom9339/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Freedom9339/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-12-20T18:06:24Z","updated_at":"2024-12-20T18:06:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mosermw I've added the depends on and made the validate attribute only show when using whole ff validation.

Hello @greyp9, I fixed the test setup, now it should work ;-) Can you please review it again?\r\n\r\nI just started the automation.\r\n\r\nIt looks like there is a bit of additional nuance related to the `kafka.tombstone` FlowFile attribute.  As you noted in the JIRA, this field is currently unused.\r\n\r\nIt makes sense that `RecordWrapperStreamKafkaRecordConverter` implements the tombstone logic.

for the question @exceptionfactory.\r\n\r\nI thought this was worth sticking with when thinking about a use case such as using NiFi as a webserver that can receive files/data through a `HandleHttpRequest` or `ListenHttp` processor where the user to be used in Elasticsearch for storage is presented as a request header/attribute that is extracted from the request to a FlowFile attribute, then used when sending the document to Elasticsearch.\r\n\r\nA similar use case would be the same sort of thing but with a JWT presented per request that could then be used for authentication with Elasticsearch.\r\n\r\nThese use cases would need careful thought by the Flow designer so as to ensure that only valid/applicable users were passed in the request. An alternative may be that the Flow contains logic to change the \"run as user\" based upon some other runtime attributes or FlowFile content.\r\n\r\nThe problem with the Controller Service-only approach is that it's limited to a single setup per service instance, i.e. it can be configured to connect/run as one single user. The per-processor/FlowFile approach means that multiple users could be used through the same service instance.\r\n\r\nThere are potentially other request headers that one might want to control on a per-request basis to Elasticsearch, but \"run as user\" (or JWT auth) in the one that seemed like it might make this change worthwhile, alongside #9605 for NIFI-10831 that allows the simpler configuration of a single user/JWT provider for an alternative static authentication mechanism between NiFi and Elasticsearch.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2573821029/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2574579321","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/9604#issuecomment-2574579321","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/9604","id":2574579321,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM6ZdPZ5","user":{"login":"babubabu","id":1678120,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzgxMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1678120?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/babubabu","html_url":"https://github.com/babubabu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/babubabu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/babubabu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/babubabu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/babubabu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/babubabu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/babubabu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/babubabu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/babubabu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/babubabu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-07T07:39:56Z","updated_at":"2025-01-07T08:39:19Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for your patience, too! \r\nThe IT class is renamed, my bad....

Why do you prefer EL?\r\n\r\nI agree EL adds some complexity, and we should be careful about introducing too much complexity from an end-user perspective. That being said, introducing three new properties to support non-deterministic random file sizes adds complexity in a different direction. I would not expect this feature to be commonly used, so that's the primary reason why it seems better to introduce EL support as a way to provide more flexibility. EL supports the test use case described, and supports deterministic sizes based in a way that isn't as easily achieved without more properties.\r\n\r\nTheoretically, the explicit property approach could still be considered down the road, but given the use case, it seems better to introduce EL as the current way forward.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2581174769/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2581211797","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/9476#issuecomment-2581211797","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/9476","id":2581211797,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM6Z2iqV","user":{"login":"pvillard31","id":11541012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTQxMDEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11541012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31","html_url":"https://github.com/pvillard31","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-09T20:43:58Z","updated_at":"2025-01-09T20:43:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the review @mosermw !

Such a test is prone to inconsistent behavior. That is some that could be addressed separately, but it points back to another reason for going with EL.\r\n\r\nThe same issue exists for the EL solution. Both do not necessarily require 1000 iterations. But because they ultimately utilize a pseudo-random number generator, I thought it wise to keep the number of iterations relatively large. It's not a compute-intensive processor, so iterating this many times is acceptable. On my system, an iteration of 1 takes ~150ms; 1,000 iterations 250ms. It's a small delta for a dramatic increase in data. This will ensure a very high likelihood that the full spectrum of allowed data sizes are covered. And, the asserts will continue to work even if the full range is not exercised. For example, say the range is intended to be 1-10 bytes, but the test only achieves 2-9 byte files. The absence of 1 and 10 will not cause the unit test to fail; it just never reached the edge cases. The only way to fail is if all 1,000 executions happen to generate the exact same-sized file. Not going to happen in our lifetime.. unless the randomizer is broken. ;) \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2581391940/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
