Also, the components in logical plan/DAG are highlighted.\r\n- Point 2 is not implemented. I was wondering which metric to use to find out which container is under back pressure. I can see that metric \"__server/__time_spent_back_pressure_initiated\" as well as \"__server/__time_spent_back_pressure_aggr\" is available from stream manager instances. Could you direct me to relevant API or metric? I can try to add this feature as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/292038960/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/292352340","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/1799#issuecomment-292352340","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1799","id":292352340,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MjM1MjM0MA==","user":{"login":"congwang","id":1209787,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDk3ODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1209787?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/congwang","html_url":"https://github.com/congwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/congwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/congwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/congwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/congwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/congwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/congwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/congwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/congwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/congwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-06T22:59:05Z","updated_at":"2017-04-06T22:59:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks good.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/292352340/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/292355115","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/1799#issuecomment-292355115","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1799","id":292355115,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MjM1NTExNQ==","user":{"login":"nlu90","id":16407807,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDA3ODA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16407807?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlu90","html_url":"https://github.com/nlu90","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlu90/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlu90/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlu90/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlu90/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlu90/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlu90/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlu90/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlu90/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlu90/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-06T23:07:40Z","updated_at":"2017-04-06T23:07:40Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"üëç ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/292355115/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/292356321","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/1799#issuecomment-292356321","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1799","id":292356321,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MjM1NjMyMQ==","user":{"login":"maosongfu","id":3028698,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMjg2OTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3028698?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu","html_url":"https://github.com/maosongfu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-06T23:12:10Z","updated_at":"2017-04-06T23:33:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks good.

I confirmed that Kryo is not used in heron-core, which means Kryo should not be linked into any fatjar at anywhere. `heron-api.jar` and `heron-storm.jar` depends on it, but this Kryo dependency will only be specified via POM.\r\n\r\nLet's now talk about whether we should exclude `backtype.storm` from `heron-storm.jar`. It seems to me that we have not reached a conclusion. cc @kramasamy ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/296309015/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/296520688","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/1811#issuecomment-296520688","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1811","id":296520688,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NjUyMDY4OA==","user":{"login":"objmagic","id":3656079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NTYwNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3656079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic","html_url":"https://github.com/objmagic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-24T04:10:38Z","updated_at":"2017-04-24T04:10:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I have cleaned up this PR quite a lot based on our discussion.
