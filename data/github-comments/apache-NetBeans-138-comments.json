This is a combination of 3 participants:\r\n1. a bug in github action `setup-java@v3`. The action seems to unpack the JDK installation with improper timestamps: instead of leaving the file stats as they are stored in the archive, the unpacked contents is timestamped with the date/time of the action execution. If an application links to a `jar` inside a JDK, such as `tools.jar` for many NB modules, various up-to-date checks might fail, since the referenced JAR's time will be that of the JDK installation, not the time of the JAR's creation.\r\n\r\n2. the `CustomJavac` task used in `nbbuild` attempts to clean debris after `depend` ANT task - the depend task does not handle inner classes well, so `CustomJavac` cleans up inner classes that depend lefts behind, based on the enclosing class' presence. Because of a bug it mishandles classes whose `$` mistakes them for innerclasses. Naturally no toplevel class `''` ever existed :)\r\n\r\n3. The sequence of steps in the workflow is:\r\n a. install JDK 11\r\n b. build\r\n c. install JDK 8\r\n d. test\r\nAt the last step, `tools.jar` from JDK8 appears **more recent than compiled classes** from step (b), the netbeans build fails up-to-date check and a module (not test, but production code) is rebuilt, partially. \r\n\r\nAs JDK8 is itypically not reinstalled each time on developer's machine - and if it was, it would be through some conventional `unzip` or `tar` that preserves file timestamps, so the up-to-date check always succeeded on local machine(s) and the recompilation step was never done in a local environment.\r\n\r\nThen, `depend` task because of (again) failed up-to-date check deleted some classes that (in)directly used `tools.jar` types; typically refactoring classes. After that, because of the bug (2), `nb-javac` deleted `$JsCallback$` class - that was never generated again.\r\n\r\nThe tests were finally run, but the required `$JsCallback*` classes were gone already.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1315317695/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1315384294","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/4921#issuecomment-1315384294","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4921","id":1315384294,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5OZyvm","user":{"login":"sdedic","id":26788611,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg4NjEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26788611?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic","html_url":"https://github.com/sdedic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-15T14:26:06Z","updated_at":"2022-11-15T14:26:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Relevant

> would it help to upload the workspace for inspection and then diff (e.g with meld) the build before and after test? Maybe there is more wrong which could give clues what is going on there.\r\n> \r\n> Interesting -- how would I fetch that artifact ?\r\n\r\nscroll down in the summary page of the workflow run (which didn't set `ci:no-build`). It lists all artifacts. The regular workflow already uploads a shared artifact after the JDK 11 build which is a tar of the whole workspace. The cleanup job however removes that again if the build is green, if it isn't green it is kept. This allows restarts of failed jobs in the middle of the pipeline without starting from scratch. (and inspection of the workspace too)\r\n\r\n\r\n> 1. a bug in github action `setup-java@v3`. The action seems to unpack the JDK installation with improper timestamps: instead of leaving the file stats as they are stored in the archive, the unpacked contents is timestamped with the date/time of the action execution. If an application links to a `jar` inside a JDK, such as `tools.jar` for many NB modules, various up-to-date checks might fail, since the referenced JAR's time will be that of the JDK installation, not the time of the JAR's creation.\r\n\r\ninteresting! We could setup all JDKs first, then use their env vars, since they all should set different vars. However, the regular workflow would build in a [primary job](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/blob/4a697ab128d7df8885a8479b5cc4212e6a56835e/.github/workflows/main.yml#L63) which produces the tar artifact as described above, then this test would run in a secondary job on a different JDK. This means each job would only setup one JDK. So this situation of setting up two JDKs in the same job should not occur outside of the job we did setup for this debugging PR here. (but we have other places which do that - so this is good to know)\r\n\r\nAlso keep in mind that this is the first thing I tried. I simply added the LSP job to the existing pipeline. Interesting that the job intended for debugging purposes added another problem to the mix :) \r\n\r\n> 2\\. the `CustomJavac` task used in `nbbuild` attempts to clean debris after `depend` ANT task - the depend task does not handle inner classes well, so `CustomJavac` cleans up inner classes that depend lefts behind, based on the enclosing class' presence.\r\n\r\ni was afraid that something like this could happen. All the hooks and wedges added a lot of non standard behavior over the years.\r\n\r\nI would suggest the following: lets extract all java changes from this PR into a fresh PR and get this PR in. Once its in, I update #4817 so that it is using a regular secondary job for the LSP testing - just like everything else.\r\n\r\nwould this be ok?\r\n\r\namazing work @sdedic, thanks a  lot!\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1315658541/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1315986939","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/4966#issuecomment-1315986939","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4966","id":1315986939,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5OcF37","user":{"login":"junichi11","id":738383,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczODM4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/738383?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11","html_url":"https://github.com/junichi11","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-15T23:05:39Z","updated_at":"2022-11-15T23:05:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@tmysik

However it was a long time ago. I would say its years not months. I actually completely forgot about it and debugged deep into lucene code to figure out why we don't get any results :). Then I remembered reading [this](https://github.com/apache/maven-indexer/blob/6a0c6017794dca6ee1af151f7914ab3cd0e4aa25/indexer-examples/indexer-examples-basic/src/main/java/org/apache/maven/index/examples/BasicUsageExample.java#L274).\r\n\r\n\r\n> Nice! smile I've been wanting to look at using central search service for ages (for NB and a platform app). I assume you've seen the search plugin? https://github.com/emilianbold/maven.search.remote\r\n\r\n@neilcsmith-net I remember you mentioning it before but only looked at it now. My first attempt was similar, I did try to implement all queries of `RepositoryIndexQueryProvider` and put it into a module, but it showed that the search service is purely for artifacts and fairly limited. A prefix group ID search wouldn't be easily possible for example. The search is unfortunately not very well documented. I looked through source code to see what it is actually returning.\r\n\r\n(btw the search can be also really slow. I sometimes got 10s response time in tests - it does cache though, so repeating the search is faster)\r\n\r\n> \r\n> Using JDK HTTP is great, but I wonder if requirement for JDK 11 will cause any concern? This module is not excluded from VSCode I think? Perhaps can be in a separate module?\r\n\r\nWell yes. This is the remainder of the first attempt to implement it, it was a separate optional module. We can borrow a bit time to use a different jdk 8 compatible client. But keep in mind that maven-indexer and lucene requires now JDK 11 too (maven-indexer has now a [nice multi threaded extraction implementation](https://github.com/apache/maven-indexer/pull/255)). So its not a if, its a when at this point. (we already backported a [whole class](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/blob/4a697ab128d7df8885a8479b5cc4212e6a56835e/java/maven.indexer/src/org/apache/lucene/search/MultiTermQuery.java#L334) due to a bugfix, this already is a fragile hack. If something would load lucene before we do, this will break)\r\n\r\nSo when will the VSCode extension switch to JDK 11?\r\n\r\n> \r\n> Could this use pre-existing JSON libs in the IDE (like the plugin does)?\r\n\r\nsure. Jackson (or any jaxb json equivalent) is just really convenient in this case and produces maintainable code. Anyone who looks at the POJOs knows what is going on there - if the service changes it can be quickly fixed. Streaming APIs require a few more brain cycles for maintainers :)\r\n\r\nThis is just an unfinished experiment to start a conversation. The method `find(final List<QueryField> fields, List<RepositoryInfo> repos)` is going to need a special case too if a class name appears.\r\n\r\n`NexusRepositoryIndexerImpl` does too much right now IMO. I think we should check if we can split it into indexer and query provider, this might make it easier to work with.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1317376099/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1317386006","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/4792#issuecomment-1317386006","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4792","id":1317386006,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5OhbcW","user":{"login":"mbien","id":114367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien","html_url":"https://github.com/mbien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-16T17:24:53Z","updated_at":"2022-11-16T17:24:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@Richard7111 congrats to your first contribution.
