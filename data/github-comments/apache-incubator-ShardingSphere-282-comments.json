But it still has the same problem althouth it doesn't restart. It costs almost time (50 datasource cost about 5 minutes, I just have a  test  so it is not all database and table ).Then when I add an datasource (other machine room like Europe), the log show it will flush all datasource (about 50+) , So I also have to wait for all datasource reflush for a long time , and then I can read the data in new datasource. Fortunately, I can query other datasource when it is reflushing. Is there a better idea to resolve it ?

But I think `metadata loading` is not the major problem. Although we maybe can optimized the metadata loading less than 1s, it also needs to cost many time to create TCP connection for jdbc init ? So I think the major problem is how to init jdbc connection parallel, and how to reuse the same datasource IP and Port but different database . Otherwise, it will cost many time to add a new datasource when people add datasource which in other machine room. Or the sharding proxy's position is not in this case which has many datasource across different machine root ?
