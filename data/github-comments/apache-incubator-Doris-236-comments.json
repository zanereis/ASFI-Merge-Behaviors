Nice work, thanks for your contribution. I've two suggestion here:\r\n> \r\n>     1. please add some unit test, there are some cases relate to `query_timeout` in FE's code, you can refer to them.\r\n> \r\n>     2. in some regression test, e.g. `regression-test/suites/ssb_sf0.1_p1/load.groovy`, we set `query_timeout` to 3600 to make sure the insert into select statement can execute success, we can replace all of these options to `insert_timeout`.\r\n\r\nRecieved, will be done later.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/1423497510/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/1423507218","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/16378#issuecomment-1423507218","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/16378","id":1423507218,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBfSlxs5U2P8S","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-09T02:07:23Z","updated_at":"2023-02-09T02:07:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"clang-tidy
