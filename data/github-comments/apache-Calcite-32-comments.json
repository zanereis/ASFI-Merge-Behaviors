I think we discussed something similar in this comment in 1311(https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-3187?focusedCommentId=16882084&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-16882084).\r\n\r\nI think the same holds true even now, I think we want to consistently override return type inference for all decimal functions so that even Calcite internals use the same rules as us. Having two sets of rules applied inconsistently between Calcite internals and Application internals will be hard to debug.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if you have an alternative that keeps the rules consistent across the board.\r\n\r\nThx.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/604246510/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/604344052","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/1876#issuecomment-604344052","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/1876","id":604344052,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwNDM0NDA1Mg==","user":{"login":"vlsi","id":213894,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzg5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/213894?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi","html_url":"https://github.com/vlsi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-26T10:16:16Z","updated_at":"2020-03-26T10:16:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/604344052/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/604479873","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/1875#issuecomment-604479873","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/1875","id":604479873,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwNDQ3OTg3Mw==","user":{"login":"neoremind","id":590102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MDEwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/590102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind","html_url":"https://github.com/neoremind","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-26T14:59:52Z","updated_at":"2020-03-26T14:59:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@danny0405 jmh test result is as below.

I have added benchmark to `ubenchmark` module. \r\nAs @hsyuan suggested, I make global caching by default. In order to benchmark against current instance level caching using `Reflection` and `MethodHandle`, especially for `MethodHandle`, classes like `ReflectUtil` and `ReflectiveVisitDispatcher` need to be updated much, so I make that change in my [fork branch](https://github.com/neoremind/calcite/blob/refvisit_benchmark/ubenchmark/src/jmh/java/org/apache/calcite/benchmarks/ReflectiveVisitDispatcherTest.java). \r\n\r\nThe test result is a little out of expectation. \r\n```\r\nBenchmark                                                                                          Mode  Cnt     Score      Error  Units\r\nReflectiveVisitDispatcherTest.testReflectiveVisitorDispatcherInvokeGlobalCaching                   avgt    3   143.483 ±   32.596  ns/op\r\nReflectiveVisitDispatcherTest.testReflectiveVisitorDispatcherInvokeInstanceCaching                 avgt    3   290.380 ±  857.199  ns/op\r\nReflectiveVisitDispatcherTest.testReflectiveVisitorDispatcherInvokeInstanceCachingUseMethodHandle  avgt    3  2487.406 ± 1083.180  ns/op\r\n```\r\nPS. I refine test to return generated result from the benchmark methods, update benchmark parameters like fork and iteration times.\r\n\r\nMethodHandle is way slow than reflection, the below part is performance killer. If I make candidateMethod to be feteched from ThreadLocal which I initialized explicitly, the average time can drop down to about 208 ns/op.\r\n```\r\nMethodType mt = MethodType.methodType(returnType, paramTypes);\r\nMethodHandle candidateMethod = MethodHandles.lookup().findVirtual(visitorClass, visitMethodName, mt);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI will look into the reason if I have more bandwidth. \r\nMy benchmark result is pretty much the same with [JavaReflectionButMuchFaster.html](http://www.jboss.org/optaplanner/blog/2018/01/09/JavaReflectionButMuchFaster.html).\r\n```\r\nBenchmark           Mode  Cnt  Score   Error  Units\r\n===================================================\r\nDirectAccess        avgt   60  2.590 ± 0.014  ns/op\r\nReflection          avgt   60  5.275 ± 0.053  ns/op // 104% slower\r\nMethodHandle        avgt   60  6.100 ± 0.079  ns/op // 136% slower\r\nStaticMethodHandle  avgt   60  2.635 ± 0.027  ns/op //   2% slower\r\nJavaCompiler        avgt   60  2.726 ± 0.026  ns/op //   5% slower\r\nLambdaMetafactory   avgt   60  3.453 ± 0.034  ns/op //  33% slower\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe need the reflection agility to be able to find methods at runtime, `MethodHanlde` seems not a good choice.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/605091418/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/605098579","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/1875#issuecomment-605098579","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/1875","id":605098579,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwNTA5ODU3OQ==","user":{"login":"vlsi","id":213894,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzg5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/213894?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi","html_url":"https://github.com/vlsi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-27T16:35:14Z","updated_at":"2020-03-27T16:35:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Have

We still plan to communicate with Presto using SQL.\r\n> > 2. RelNode -> SqlNode is not quite mature I believe, but I may be wrong there.\r\n> > 3. The optimization enabled by RelNode is helpful. But not a high-pri since Presto will also optimize the internal execution plan.\r\n> \r\n> Usually we have 2 kinds of use cases for Calcite:\r\n> \r\n> * Generates RelNode/RexNode to adapter other downstream planners\r\n> * Generates RelNode/RexNode and unparse it as special SQL dialect to interpretation through JDBC.\r\n> \r\n> Either way we should generates a working plan, that is why I suggest to add SqlToRel test. For more general, we should add operator test and SQL ITCase if we change an operator semantics. But for you case, I think a SqlToRelConverter test is okey.\r\n\r\nI have added tests for it. But it needs changes on SqlToRelConverter. \r\n\r\nThe change is because usually for STRUCT, Uncollect will flatten the type but for this feature, it should not. This is also aligned with the registered type during validation.\r\n\r\nI am not sure whether this should be the best way to implement it. Let me know. Thanks.\r\n\r\nEDIT: If you think this change is large unnecessarily because we don't need SqlToRel conversion right now), I am happy to revert the SqlToRel conversion changes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/605682367/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/605682713","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/1811#issuecomment-605682713","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/1811","id":605682713,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwNTY4MjcxMw==","user":{"login":"my7ym","id":46771373,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NzcxMzcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46771373?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/my7ym","html_url":"https://github.com/my7ym","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/my7ym/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/my7ym/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/my7ym/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/my7ym/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/my7ym/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/my7ym/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/my7ym/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/my7ym/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/my7ym/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-29T18:54:50Z","updated_at":"2020-03-29T18:54:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":">
