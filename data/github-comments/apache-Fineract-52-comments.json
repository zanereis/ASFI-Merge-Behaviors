Why wouldn't we put this in application.properties?\r\n> > \r\n> > \r\n> > @vidakovic we wanna be able to change the configuration value runtime.\r\n> \r\n> ... that is a solved problem in Spring/Boot (search: \"reloadable configuration\")... I'd say not a strong argument to bury it in the database...\r\n\r\nI'm not saying you're wrong but if I remember correctly reloading configuration is only supported with Spring Cloud and done by annotating classes with `@RefreshScope`. Now, upon refresh, you'll have the choice whether to just \"refresh\" the application context, reload or shutdown-reload it. \r\n\r\nI've used it with a cloud project but I think fineract in its current form is not suitable for this and could cause issues with context refreshes.\r\n\r\n**TL;DR;** I think going with refreshable properties with Spring's approach is way too premature for Fineract.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/1416027468/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/1425437713","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/2968#issuecomment-1425437713","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/2968","id":1425437713,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAuLPJ85U9nQR","user":{"login":"jumba2010","id":28118654,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTE4NjU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28118654?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jumba2010","html_url":"https://github.com/jumba2010","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jumba2010/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jumba2010/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jumba2010/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jumba2010/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jumba2010/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jumba2010/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jumba2010/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jumba2010/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jumba2010/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-10T08:53:35Z","updated_at":"2023-02-10T08:53:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Did PR to wrong branch","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/1425437713/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/1431283321","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/2912#issuecomment-1431283321","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/2912","id":1431283321,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAuLPJ85VT6Z5","user":{"login":"forking-renovate[bot]","id":34481203,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MzQ0ODEyMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/7402?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/forking-renovate%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/forking-renovate","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forking-renovate%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forking-renovate%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forking-renovate%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forking-renovate%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forking-renovate%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forking-renovate%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forking-renovate%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forking-renovate%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forking-renovate%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-15T12:19:59Z","updated_at":"2023-02-15T12:19:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Renovate Ignore Notification\n\nAs this PR has been closed unmerged, Renovate will ignore this upgrade and you will not receive PRs for *any* future 2.x releases.
