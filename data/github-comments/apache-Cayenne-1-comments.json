Still a bit of nitpicking... \n1. I suggest storing 'deletedDataMaps' in the Project, not in DataChannelDescriptor. The reason is - DataChannelDescriptor is used in Cayenne runtime, where there's no notion of \"deleting a DataMap\", so I don't want to expose that new API there. As Project doesn't deal with DataMaps directly, you might save deleted DataMaps as Resource's for instance.\n2. I sorta understand the reason for renaming SaveUnit to Unit (since some units are \"delete units\") .. Still \"Unit\" is too generic. I'd keep SaveUnit, and if you want to distinguish save from delete, create another inner class - DeleteUnit or something (and indeed the two have different structure, so manybe there's no point to keep them as one class)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cayenne/issues/comments/54182642/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cayenne/issues/comments/54743202","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cayenne/pull/10#issuecomment-54743202","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cayenne/issues/10","id":54743202,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NzQzMjAy","user":{"login":"andrus","id":42668,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNjY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42668?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus","html_url":"https://github.com/andrus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-09-07T10:38:24Z","updated_at":"2014-09-07T10:38:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"applied with a small refactoring as a separate commit\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cayenne/issues/comments/54743202/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cayenne/issues/comments/54743218","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cayenne/pull/9#issuecomment-54743218","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cayenne/issues/9","id":54743218,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NzQzMjE4","user":{"login":"andrus","id":42668,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNjY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42668?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus","html_url":"https://github.com/andrus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-09-07T10:39:16Z","updated_at":"2014-09-07T10:39:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Unit tests failures are still happening even after applying #10.

A few notes:\n1. Thread safety: SimpleDateFormat is stateful and is not tread-safe. So we have no choice but to create formatters on the fly when checking the date. \n2. General design: would be great if CharType could convert String to Date, but then delegate the actual binding to a DateType (TimestampType, etc) instead of doing it on its own. If we don't do that, we'll bypass per-adapter ExtendedTypes. \n\n\"2\" concerns me. I am researching an approach of sharing ExtendedTypes between each other. And an alternative approach of  changing the expression syntax to explicitly indicate which literals are dates. JPA for instance supports JDBC escape syntax, which looks kind of ugly:\n\na = {d 'yyyy-mm-dd'}\n\nWe may need something better (??). So I guess we'll place this on hold until we decide on a better solution. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cayenne/issues/comments/57998904/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cayenne/issues/comments/59452128","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cayenne/pull/18#issuecomment-59452128","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cayenne/issues/18","id":59452128,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NDUyMTI4","user":{"login":"andrus","id":42668,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNjY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42668?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus","html_url":"https://github.com/andrus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-10-17T00:42:45Z","updated_at":"2014-10-17T00:42:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks! \n\nJust pushed this pull request.

stuff. Metadata-driven DbCleaner is what we need. A few small notes:\n- 'DbCleaner.loader' is an ivar that is created and used in a single method, so probably needs to be a local var of that method. \n- Using 'setupAfterInjection' to call DbCleaner and then certain subclasses reimplementing it as an empty method to suppress DbCleaner call feels kind of dirty. Let's redesign this. Some ideas: add an extra  property to @UseServerRuntime annotation to enable/disable DbCleaner per
