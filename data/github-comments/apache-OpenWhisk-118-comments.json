Basically, what is the standard where the dev. community is not perpetually claiming depl. X is broken (cannot run even on daily builds)...  In addition, we have to make sure anything in main repo. is ready for the apache release process being developed.  Clearly, Kube and Mesos are on that path; what is the consistent test/criteria we apply to any other that comes along?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/368879356/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/368919819","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/3133#issuecomment-368919819","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/3133","id":368919819,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2ODkxOTgxOQ==","user":{"login":"jonpspri","id":2462804,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjI4MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2462804?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonpspri","html_url":"https://github.com/jonpspri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonpspri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonpspri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonpspri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonpspri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonpspri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonpspri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonpspri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonpspri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonpspri/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-27T15:37:54Z","updated_at":"2018-02-27T15:37:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I moved the changes to tools/ubuntu-setup into #3358 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/368919819/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/368923722","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/3356#issuecomment-368923722","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/3356","id":368923722,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2ODkyMzcyMg==","user":{"login":"chetanmeh","id":664531,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NDUzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/664531?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chetanmeh","html_url":"https://github.com/chetanmeh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chetanmeh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chetanmeh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chetanmeh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chetanmeh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chetanmeh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chetanmeh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chetanmeh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chetanmeh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chetanmeh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-27T15:49:00Z","updated_at":"2018-02-27T16:34:34Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Currently when any entity is deleted we do not have entity instance. So this would make it tricky to implement `deleteAttachment(docInfo, name)`. Instead we can have a method like\r\n\r\n```\r\nprotected[core] def deleteAttachments[T](doc: DocInfo)(\r\n    implicit transid: TransactionId): Future[Boolean]\r\n```\r\nHere the `ArtifactStore` implementation can remove all attachments related to the given docId. This requires that\r\n1. custom `AttachmentStore` (probably a new SPI for later) stores attachment with blob id set to \"${doc.id.id}/$name\"\r\n2. Delete operation can be implemented by removing all blobs with id starting with document id\r\n\r\nThis may involve multiple calls depending on `AttachmentStore`  implementation. Below are details around API support from various Blob/Object stores. So it should be possible to implement the `deleteAttachments` across such stores\r\n\r\n### S3\r\n\r\nS3 does not provide a direct call to [delete by prefix][1]. Instead we need to \r\n\r\n1. first [list blobid][2] matching given prefix \r\n2. Delete then via [multiple delete support][3]\r\n\r\n### Azure Blob Storage\r\n\r\nIt does not support performing multiple deletes in single call. Instead we would need to \r\n\r\n1. [List Blobs][4] matching given prefix\r\n2. Delete then [one by one][5]\r\n\r\n### IBM Object Storage\r\n\r\nIts closer to S3 so\r\n\r\n1. [List Blob Objects][6] matching given prefix\r\n2.
