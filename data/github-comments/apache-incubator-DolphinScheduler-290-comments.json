current dolphinscheduler is still too complicated to configure, and often requires pointing and clicking, which is a pain in the ass.\r\nI was wondering if we could just parse a sql into a DAG for scheduling.

corresponds to insert operation.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1135\" alt=\"图片\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60029759/186134686-a769465e-8f71-4112-990a-d665f749adc6.png\">\r\n\r\nProduction
