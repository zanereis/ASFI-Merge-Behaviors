Just one caveat: at the moment there is no compatible Spring Cloud release for Spring Boot 2.6.0. Just in case someone is using that combination in customized projects. For the Fineract release it's irrelevant.\r\n> \r\n> @ptuomola any ideas why the Travis stuff is failing? Other than that I think this can be approved.\r\n\r\nThe GitHub Gradle build runs exactly the same code as the Travis one, so I think we're safe here. Overall I think the Travis is much more susceptible to all kinds of disturbances (load, timing etc) than the GitHub one - and the Github is faster. I think we should reduce the Travis one to just run the SonarQube analysis (as that can't be integrated to GitHub).
