First a couple things I'm curious about:\r\n- when I open the date/time range picker why does it say \"now/d\"?  I would expect just \"now\" or \"Now\"\r\n- when I first navigate to the Alerts UI or select \"All time\" why do I see a timestamp clause in the query?  Why not just leave it out?\r\n\r\nI also found some issues.  The first is related to time-range selections that include 'Now' as part of the range (Last 7 days, Last 5 minutes, Today so far, etc).  This should be a sliding window so I would expect the search query to be different every time the results are refreshed.  For example when I select \"Last 5 minutes\" this is the query that is immediately sent (only query field is shown for simplicity):\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"query\": \"timestamp:(>=1508426193000 AND  <=1508426493000)\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAfter several cycles the query does not change although \"Last 5 minutes\" is a different time window now:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"query\": \"timestamp:(>=1508426193000 AND  <=1508426493000)\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI would also expect the time range to change in the time range selector dropdown (\"2017-10-19 10:16:33 to Now\" for example) as well.\r\n\r\nI also found the time range selector value isn't populated correctly when loading a saved or recent search.  For example when I select a recent or saved search the time range clause is included in the search bar and the searches now return a 500 error:\r\n```\r\n\"query\": \"timestamp:\\\\(\\\\>\\\\=0 AND :\\\\ \\\\<\\\\=4102444800000\\\\) AND source\\\\:type:bro\"\r\n```  \r\nBased on how it works normally I would expect there to be no time range clause in the search bar and the time range dropdown to be populated correctly instead.\r\n\r\nA couple other minor issues:\r\n\r\n- if I select a cell in the table to apply a filter, then remove the filter by hovering over it in the search bar and clicking 'x', the time range dropdown is disabled.\r\n- when I select a Quick Range filter or open the drop down after a , the Time Range inputs are not updated and still say \"now/d\"\r\n- when I click the 'X' or clear button in the search bar, I would expect the time range selector to be reset to \"All time\"\r\n- when I open the drop down and change the \"FROM\" time range, I would expect the \"TO\" input to still say \"now\" (it's automatically set to end of the day picked in \"FROM\")\r\n- when I open the drop down and change either \"FROM\", \"TO\" or both, I would expect those inputs to reset if I closed the dropdown without hitting \"Apply\" (they are still populated when I open the dropdown again)\r\n\r\nAs far as testing is concerned, this is my understanding of the tests included in this PR:\r\n- verify all the links and time/date inputs are present in the time range selector\r\n- verify the drop down label changes to the correct value when a Quick Range is selected (time range below the label is not tested)\r\n- verify the result count in the table changes when a Time Range is entered\r\n\r\nThis is a good start but I think we need more to cover the issues I found.  I would suggest adding tests to:\r\n- ensure saved/recent searches includes and functions properly when a Time Range/Quick Range is selected\r\n- test all the Quick Range filters to ensure they produce the correct time range (I realize this could be tedious to test using search results so I would compromise and just test that the correct range is populated in the drop down and time range inputs)\r\n- add validations for the time range selector when filters are added/removed in the search bar\r\n- expand tests on setting \"FROM\" and \"TO\" inputs to cover the issues noted above","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/337965321/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/337970573","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/796#issuecomment-337970573","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/796","id":337970573,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzk3MDU3Mw==","user":{"login":"cestella","id":540359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/540359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella","html_url":"https://github.com/cestella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-19T16:55:41Z","updated_at":"2017-10-19T16:55:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I definitely like the testing section @merrimanr I'd like to see the test in existence in the PR split into the test cases that you suggest.

It's a pretty significant feature so that's not surprising.  I know there are some other PRs being worked on that this PR depends on (https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/806).  Some questions I have:\r\n- In this PR description, what does 'Change the state of meta alert' mean?\r\n- Can I create a new empty metaalert?\r\n- Can I create a metaalert by manually selecting alerts?\r\n- How do I create a metaalert from a group that is >1 levels deep? \r\n- How do I see all metaalerts? I was able to query with \"_exists_:alert.*\" but that is not intuitive.\r\n- Can I only remove 1 alert from a metaalert at a time?\r\n- Would it be useful to assign a name to your metaalert in the confirmation form rather than having to find it after you create it and rename in the detail view?\r\n- Not a fan of vertical scrolling through alerts in metaalert detail, would it be possible to add pagination?\r\n\r\nSome initial bugs I found (commented on some of these):\r\n- metaalert index name throughout code is wrong, should be 'metaalert'\r\n- metaalerts have alert_status set to 'NEW'\r\n- when you group by ip address fields, then expand group, count goes to 0 and corrects after the next search (not sure if this existed before this PR)\r\n- clicking on a metaalert fires this findOne call:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"guid\": \"ca80f4fc-0cdb-431c-b972-c460dad022ee\",\r\n  \"sensorType\": \"undefined\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n- not obvious from a user perspective what happens when I remove all alerts from a metaalert (I can see rest call that sets metaalert status to inactive)\r\n- missing space in alert merge confirmation and 1 alert displays as '1alerts'\r\n- need to add metaalert index to e2e npm environment\r\n- when metaalerts and alerts are in the same result set, sorting on fields other than timestamp causes metaalerts to be excluded\r\n- when I select an alert and then select Add to Alert in bulk actions, metaalerts display 0 alerts  ie.\r\n (0) \r\n- adding a comment to metaalert is failing because sensorType is undefined in patch request:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"patch\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"op\": \"add\",\r\n      \"path\": \"/comments\",\r\n      \"value\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"comment\": \"test\",\r\n          \"username\": \"user\",\r\n          \"timestamp\": 1508446386940\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n  \"guid\": \"b9479340-316b-46db-baa5-0a0376ff015a\",\r\n  \"index\": \"metaalert_index\",\r\n  \"sensorType\": \"undefined\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n- when I change/assign a metaalert name, reverts back to id in search result list on next search\r\n- comment icons in the list view are not appearing after I add a comment even though comments are displayed in the metaalert default view (likely related to failed add comment call, being written only to hbase and not ES)\r\n\r\nI'm also assuming more e2e tests are coming soon.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/338039649/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/338041144","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/803#issuecomment-338041144","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/803","id":338041144,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzODA0MTE0NA==","user":{"login":"james-sirota","id":4854764,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NTQ3NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4854764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-sirota","html_url":"https://github.com/james-sirota","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-sirota/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-sirota/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-sirota/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-sirota/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-sirota/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-sirota/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-sirota/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-sirota/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-sirota/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-19T21:19:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-19T21:24:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"In this PR description, what does 'Change the state of meta alert' mean?\r\n\r\n> This should say \"Group alerts into meta alert\"\r\n\r\nCan I create a new empty metaalert?\r\n\r\n> No, empty meta alert doesn't make sense\r\n\r\nCan I create a metaalert by manually selecting alerts?\r\n\r\n> Yes, you should be able to.

Although these are installation instructions, the lines you grepped are all OUTPUT from `find` or `rpm`.  In use with an 0.4.2 code base, the actual output will be the correct-in-that-context 0.4.2 filenames and pathnames.  So while user might be surprised at first, they will not (if they're following instructions) be caused to type incorrect commands.  And since 0.4.2 hasn't been released yet, there is no date field that I can substitute for `201707131420` would be \"correct\" with 0.4.2.\r\n\r\nI think it's best to leave it the way it is.  If you prefer a different rendering, please propose.\r\n\r\nRegarding the line from metron-analytics/metron-profiler-client/README.md that has an 0.4.1, this is in the text of an example, and does not materially affect the example.  Therefore, as noted in the opening comments of this PR, it is my policy to leave it unchanged.  \"If you grep for `0.4.1` (or rather for `0\\\\.4\\\\.1`), you'll find some remaining usage of 0.4.1 in documentation files, where I judged the usefulness of an example did not require updating the version number.\"\r\n\r\nOpen to discussion, of course.  But by following this policy, those (many) lines of text fall out of the grep on the next generation (when moving from 0.4.2 to 0.4.3).  Which makes release management much easier.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/338508550/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/338529617","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/767#issuecomment-338529617","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/767","id":338529617,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzODUyOTYxNw==","user":{"login":"ottobackwards","id":1111551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTE1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards","html_url":"https://github.com/ottobackwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-23T02:08:47Z","updated_at":"2017-10-23T02:08:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I don't have strong enough feelings to hold this back.

Why not just leave it out? - Fixed\r\n- The first is related to time-range selections that include 'Now' as part of the range (Last 7 days, Last 5 minutes, Today so far, etc). This should be a sliding window so I would expect the search query to be different every time the results are refreshed. - Fixed\r\n- I also found the time range selector value isn't populated correctly when loading a saved or recent search. -Fixed\r\n- if I select a cell in the table to apply a filter, then remove the filter by hovering over it in the search bar and clicking 'x', the time range dropdown is disabled. -Fixed\r\n- when I select a Quick Range filter or open the drop-down after a, the Time Range inputs are not updated and still say \"now/d\" - I felt 'Quick Range' and 'Time Range' should be mutually exclusive. If it is confusing I can fix it. \r\n- when I click the 'X' or clear button in the search bar, I would expect the time range selector to be reset to \"All time\" - Fixed\r\n- when I open the drop down and change the \"FROM\" time range, I would expect the \"TO\" input to still say \"now\" (it's automatically set to end of the day picked in \"FROM\") - This is intentional just to ensure that To date is not before From date\r\n- when I open the drop down and change either \"FROM\", \"TO\" or both, I would expect those inputs to reset if I closed the dropdown without hitting \"Apply\" (they are still populated when I open the dropdown again) - If it is not really annoying I would leave this to default behaviour.

But if I search with `host:ip-addr.es` or even `alert.host:ip-addr.es` it does not return any results.\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-10-23 at 6 12 46 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2475409/31915798-de2a9b60-b81d-11e7-9d32-180f19fe7cbf.png)\r\n\r\nWhen using `alert.host`  the UI submits the following which returns no results.\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"indices\": [\r\n    \"websphere\",\r\n    \"snort\",\r\n    \"asa\",\r\n    \"bro\",\r\n    \"yaf\",\r\n    \"metaalert\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"facetFields\": [\r\n    \"source:type\",\r\n    \"ip_src_addr\",\r\n    \"ip_dst_addr\",\r\n    \"host\",\r\n    \"enrichments:geo:ip_dst_addr:country\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"query\": \"(host:ip\\\\-addr.es OR alert.host:ip\\\\-addr.es)\",\r\n  \"from\": 0,\r\n  \"size\": 25,\r\n  \"sort\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"field\": \"host\",\r\n      \"sortOrder\": \"asc\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI ran this by @justinleet and we found that it is the `sort` field that prevents the meta-alerts from being returned.

issue is still not fixed:\r\n\r\n- The first is related to time-range selections that include 'Now' as part of the range (Last 7 days, Last 5 minutes, Today so far, etc).

Seems kind of strange to import a class (QueryBuilder) in alerts-list into a service but I'll let you decide if that is ideal.\r\n\r\nSaved search is working now and everything else seems to function correctly.  I did notice a regression where if I rename a column, type a query with the friendly name in the query box (ie. sourceType:snort) results are no longer returned.  Not sure if that was introduced in this PR or not because I don't think we are testing for it.\r\n\r\nI am still not a fan of how the Time Range selection works.
