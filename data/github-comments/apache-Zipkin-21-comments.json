The Zipkin story about what and how the instrumentation libs have to send is already super convoluted.\n- In RPC case the start/duration can be derived either from server annotations or from client annotations, depending on where the instrumentation exists. There isn't really such a thing as a \"span\" in the ingestion pipeline, more like multiple slices of span. A slice + annotations is not ambiguous (although  \"span name\" is), but slice + start/duration definitely are. So someone need to resolve that somewhere, and I think it's better resolved using the raw data of annotations than using potentially incorrectly calculated start/duration.\n- In cases when instrumentation cannot send the complete span, some other mechanism, like a Spark pipeline, can do a post-processing and calculate start/duration having seen the complete span in the storage (multiple slices stored independently). It would certainly be storage implementation dependent how such post-caculated result would be stored. In Cassandra we'd add a record to the index by duration. If other stores have a record representing a complete span, they would have to make an update to that record. Forcing Cassandra to store an update of post-calculation would be pretty bad for performance.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/152879108/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/152879357","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/807#issuecomment-152879357","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/807","id":152879357,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1Mjg3OTM1Nw==","user":{"login":"yurishkuro","id":3523016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MjMwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3523016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro","html_url":"https://github.com/yurishkuro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-02T00:03:07Z","updated_at":"2015-11-02T00:03:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"btw, what is your concern with having these two fields be implementation-specific?

Which is probably a bad assumption anyway, nowhere do we say that root span ID must be equal to trace_id (a more accurate check would've been parent_id == nil or 0).\n\nQ2 - the sql duration query checks for service_name == query.sn. In combination with the above, I conclude it's only limited to the services mentioned in the root span.\n\nQ3 - I remember the slice query, iirc it's one of the reasons the limit param doesn't work correctly in combination queries. This is very hard to support in Cassandra, actually. I would go as far as forcing the UI to make the use choose between annotations query and duration queries. If we want to support both, then at least in Cassandra implementation it requires in-memory join of trace IDs from different index queries, and it's fairly hard to make that join work correctly with LIMIT.\n\nIt's fairly easy to implement correct LIMIT for serviceName {+span name} + duration combination in Cassandra, as it can all be stored in the duration index I showed above. As for the semantics of such query, I would go for span-level query, i.e. where both duration and service-name (and span name) must apply to the _same span_ in order for the trace ID to qualify. It seems like it would satisfy most of the queries. The one that it would not satisfy is finding long traces by service name whose span was not long.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/154773877/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/154840091","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/824#issuecomment-154840091","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/824","id":154840091,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NDg0MDA5MQ==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-08T16:41:51Z","updated_at":"2015-11-08T16:41:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"since

We will have a default start_ts in the search that is invisible to the user. I do not think it will be obvious why most of the data is invisible in searches (i.e. can't search for anything before the QUERY_LOOKBACK which users do not know how was setup as is invisible to them.\n\nAlso is inflexible, if I deployed 3 days ago and would like to see data from the last 4 days to compare before and after, I can not if QUERY_LOOKBACK is set to 2 days. I can set it to 5days but then high-volume services will still have the original problem, etc.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/155171960/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/155173757","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/826#issuecomment-155173757","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/826","id":155173757,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NTE3Mzc1Nw==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-09T19:59:14Z","updated_at":"2015-11-09T19:59:14Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"default QUERY_LOOKBACK is an environment variable, so it isn't visible to\nusers anyway.

Add Lookback to the UI. User clicks or allows the date to be set how it is, then they choose 5minutes lookback.\n2. change the UI from basing on endTs (looking backwards) to being based on startTs (looking forwards)\nFor example, we choose a point in time, and we look for results newer than that.\n3. change the UI from basing on endTs (which is almost always current time) to being based on timestamp. Add a +- option. For example, user enters 9:55 +- 5minutes. This is easy to convert to endTs, lookback.\n\nRegardless, there's a different aspect, which is the order of trace results. If limit was subject to descending order of timestamp, they'd always get freshest by default, regardless of
