This needs to be fixed in CI.\r\n\r\nHow to reproduce:\r\nOperating System: Rocky Linux 8\r\n\r\n1. Install chromium:\r\nyum install -y chromium\r\n\r\n2. Change directory to ambari:\r\ncd ambari\r\n\r\n3.

The error message indicates that `CHROME_BIN` is not set, so let's set it:\r\n\r\nexport CHROME_BIN=/usr/bin/chromium-browser\r\n\r\nContinue execution:\r\nmvn -X -T 2C -am test -pl ambari-web -Dmaven.artifact.threads=10 -Drat.skip\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/ambari/assets/18082602/febe9492-3ef6-49a9-ae85-b63b49debe25)\r\n\r\n\r\n2.

Therefore, I am still considering whether to close this PR and discuss on the mailing list whether we need to change so much code to add a new operating system or if there is a simpler way to extend support for other operating systems.\r\n> \r\n\r\n\r\n+1 for this idea.\r\n Many operating systems now use YUM as the package manager. If these OS can be grouped into one category, it will be much simpler to add similar operating systems in the future.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/issues/comments/1962918716/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/issues/comments/1963918452","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ambari/pull/3666#issuecomment-1963918452","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/issues/3666","id":1963918452,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACVE2c51DwR0","user":{"login":"tisonkun","id":18818196,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4ODE4MTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18818196?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun","html_url":"https://github.com/tisonkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-26T11:27:16Z","updated_at":"2024-02-26T11:27:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"No feedback.

snap package. Common installation locations include:\r\n\r\n1. **Installed via apt** (Ubuntu repositories):\r\n   - `/usr/bin/chromium-browser`\r\n\r\n2. **Installed via snap**:\r\n   - `/snap/bin/chromium`\r\n\r\nFor modifying the Jenkins script, there are two suggested approaches:\r\n\r\n### Approach 1: Limit the Search Scope\r\n\r\nSince `chromium-browser` is most likely installed in `/usr/bin/` or `/snap/bin/` for snap installations, you can directly check these locations instead of the entire filesystem to avoid unnecessary permission issues. The modified Jenkins script could look like this:\r\n\r\n```groovy\r\nstage('Parallel Unit Tests') {\r\n    parallel {\r\n        stage('Ambari WebUI Tests') {\r\n            steps {\r\n                sh 'lsb_release -a'\r\n                sh 'ls /usr/bin'\r\n                // Directly check possible installation locations\r\n                sh 'if [ -f /usr/bin/chromium-browser ]; then export CHROME_BIN=/usr/bin/chromium-browser; fi'\r\n                sh 'if [ -f /snap/bin/chromium ]; then export CHROME_BIN=/snap/bin/chromium; fi'\r\n                sh 'mvn -X -T 2C -am test -pl ambari-web,ambari-admin -Dmaven.artifact.threads=10 -Drat.skip'\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        // Other test stages...\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Approach 2: Using sudo\r\n\r\nIf you need to search the entire filesystem for `chromium-browser` and you have permissions to use `sudo` in Jenkins scripts, you can run the `find` command with `sudo`. However, this is generally not recommended for security reasons, as it could expose sensitive parts of the system or unnecessarily elevate script permissions. If you decide to use `sudo`, ensure the Jenkins user has appropriate `sudo` privileges and the `sudoers` configuration is correct. The modified command might look like:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nsh 'sudo find / -name \"chromium-browser\" 2>/dev/null'\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere, `2>/dev/null` is used to ignore error output, such as permission denied messages.\r\n\r\n**Security Tip**: In production environments, avoid using `sudo` for commands that could affect system security and stability. Approach 1 is a safer, more focused method and should be considered first.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/issues/comments/1999127109/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/issues/comments/2002998779","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ambari/pull/3775#issuecomment-2002998779","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/issues/3775","id":2002998779,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACVE2c53Y1X7","user":{"login":"virajjasani","id":34790606,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NzkwNjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34790606?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/virajjasani","html_url":"https://github.com/virajjasani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virajjasani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virajjasani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virajjasani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virajjasani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virajjasani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virajjasani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virajjasani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virajjasani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virajjasani/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-18T06:07:37Z","updated_at":"2024-03-18T06:07:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sure we can try these options.
