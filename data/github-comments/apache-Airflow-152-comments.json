But is that relevant to how unidecode is used by Airflow/slugify/nvd3? In other words, does usage of text-unidecode have significant disadvantage?\r\n\r\nIf not I'd suggest to set `SLUGIFY_USES_TEXT_UNIDECODE` as default and avoid the required user choice which makes it easier to install Airflow. It still makes sense to have `GPL_UNIDECODE` as optional choice. \r\n\r\nIf there is a disadvantage I'd suggest to mention them in the `INSTALL` and in the printed error. Otherwise users may be confused and don't know what to do (at least I am).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/408630673/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/408631012","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3532#issuecomment-408631012","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3532","id":408631012,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwODYzMTAxMg==","user":{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-28T19:50:19Z","updated_at":"2018-07-28T19:50:19Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@fenglu-g
