I still would strive to reduce that global list to the minimum, but maybe we have to do that in a second step.\r\n\r\n2. what I find less helpful is the fact that the names are causing a failure(). In certain cases, reserved names can still be used but require a bit of treamtment. For example, in C# it is done by prefixing such a name with `@` to make *any* identifier a valid one, such as `@return` instead of `return`. The generator can do this alone and therefore there is no need to throw at all. In other languages we often added an underscore at the end of the name, which requireds a bit of tracking but otherwise works quite well. \r\n\r\n4. Last not least, the reserved identifiers may also be context dependent. There are keywords, there are reserved words and there are special built-in method and property names used by the runtime that should not be used either, even if the are not a keyword in the strict sense. Context dependent now means, that expecially the latter ones differ between regular structs/classes and exceptions, to name just one possible case.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/401536272/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/401795524","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/546#issuecomment-401795524","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/546","id":401795524,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMTc5NTUyNA==","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-02T12:57:22Z","updated_at":"2018-07-02T12:57:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @ben-craig.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry for a stupid question.

Specifically, TFramedTransport readSlow() attempts to read a size off the underlying transport and then attempts to read as much as possible from the underlying transport.  If it doesn't read the entire message indicated by the size, it will return a partial read.  The upper layer will then call readSlow again, which will try to read another size off the wire, destroying message integrity.  It's amazing to see such a bug in code that's been around for a long time.  Funny thing is I have been adding support for message bus transports based on TFramedTransport being correct, and obviously it is not.\r\n\r\nSo the lua library is just fine writing size and then writing payload.  I think that's still better than copying the size and payload into another buffer (increasing memory requirements to write by 2x) and then writing all at once.\r\n\r\nSo you correctly identified there was a problem but the issue is on the C++ side, not on the lua side.  If another client did the same thing, the C++ server would fail the same way.\r\n\r\nThat said, I'd like to take over this issue in Jira and I will fix TFramedTransport, hopefully this week.  My current employer is providing me with the time to work on message bus support for thrift, and I need TFramedTransport to work properly.  In fact, I may add a test that specifically targets this issue to see if it is present on any other library implementation.\r\n\r\nI'm closing this PR as this change is not necessary.

I can remove python keywords not used by other supported languages from the global list. It seems a bit risky though.\r\n\r\n2. I really can't see a problem here. With this change the behavior for all generators (except for py) is exactly the same as before: a keyword from the global list causes a failure. As soon as generator learns to make valid ids from keywords, it overrides the validate_input method with no-op or even implements a context dependent validation.\r\n\r\n3. I can see your concern here. Speaking of py generator, I haven't found any logic for built-ins, so maybe it's better to start from keywords first. As I've said before, a generator can implement these complex checks in their validate_input methods.\r\n\r\nI couldn't find a way to make it easy for all generators to generate valid code from a source with a keyword. There are cases when the original id is needed to suppport protocol and there are cases when the id should be tweaked to make code compileable. It seems like there is no way around going through the code and changing a half of id occurences. After it's done, switching off failures on keywords seems pretty easy.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/402600811/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/402721880","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/1566#issuecomment-402721880","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/1566","id":402721880,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMjcyMTg4MA==","user":{"login":"jeking3","id":11771245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzcxMjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11771245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3","html_url":"https://github.com/jeking3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-05T13:29:05Z","updated_at":"2018-07-05T13:29:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"python library does the same thing as this change so I am going to merge it.

On complete-payload-detected it would synchronously processes it, fire a raw response to a registered listener/process, and continue ingesting more bytes.\r\nFull and chunked requests would then be equally handled, and transports and processors would be decoupled better.\r\nNot a quick fix though.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/416648920/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/416796831","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/1583#issuecomment-416796831","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/1583","id":416796831,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNjc5NjgzMQ==","user":{"login":"jeking3","id":11771245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzcxMjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11771245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3","html_url":"https://github.com/jeking3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-29T01:54:03Z","updated_at":"2018-08-29T01:54:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks good to me as well, but need tests to pass.

Do you actually see refc binary leakage?  I could maybe see that happen if you have long lived connections, from which you subtract a smallish portion of the binary from a much larger thrift object and pass it around, but I'm not totally certain.  Is there a case where you are actually seeing this leakage occuring?  @k32 Have you checked out https://github.com/openx/ox-thrift which @dhull wrote?  It uses the ranch acceptor pool instead of the standard server and is a complete rewrite of the message encoding/decoding.  It's about 5-10x faster at encoding/decoding, so it's an improvement.  The only way to make it faster would be to rewrite the compiler which @dhull has looked at but not done (the idea would be to generate a custom module for encoding/decoding instead of the generic structures which then get interpreted, this should lead to even more efficiency as you'd not have to go through an intermediate representation).  Anyway, maybe David will take a look at this, but I think it's probably fine to merge.  My only real comment would be that this appears to make the default copying the binaries, which could be a surprise if people aren't expecting it and are moving large thrift structures around.  So it might be worthwhile to document that somewhere, not sure where though.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/418246218/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/418250469","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/1585#issuecomment-418250469","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/1585","id":418250469,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxODI1MDQ2OQ==","user":{"login":"k32","id":10274441,"node_id":"U_kgDOAJzGiQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10274441?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k32","html_url":"https://github.com/k32","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k32/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k32/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k32/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k32/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k32/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k32/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k32/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k32/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k32/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-04T06:01:50Z","updated_at":"2018-09-04T06:01:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@djnym Thanks for the suggestion; on the first glance ox-thrift looks very promising.
