The idea is to reuse existing OutputFormats (DataSet) and SinkFunctions (DataStream) as much as possible. The configuration of the `TableSink` with field names and types happens internally and is not user-facing. \n\nWhile the goal is to support many different systems, we do not want to blow up the the dependencies of the `flink-table` module. With the current design we can add TableSinks to the respective modules in `flink-batch-connectors` and `flink-streaming-connectors` and don't have to add all external dependencies to `flink-table`. Also we want to give users the option to define their own TableSinks.\n\nI am not sure about configuring the output type and parameters with untyped Strings. IMO, this makes it hard to identify and look up relevant parameters and options. \nBut maybe we can add a registration of TableSinks to the TableEnvironment and do something like:\n\n```\ntEnv.registerSinkType(\"csv\", classOf[CsvTableSink])\n\nval t: Table = ...\nt.toSink(\"csv\").option(\"path\", \"/foo\").option(\"fieldDelim\", \"|\")\n```\n\nWe would need to find a way to pass the options to the TableSink constructor, maybe via reflection... \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/216588444/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/216622861","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1953#issuecomment-216622861","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1953","id":216622861,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNjYyMjg2MQ==","user":{"login":"IgorBerman","id":3739735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3Mzk3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3739735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgorBerman","html_url":"https://github.com/IgorBerman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgorBerman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgorBerman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgorBerman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgorBerman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgorBerman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgorBerman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgorBerman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgorBerman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IgorBerman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-03T18:33:00Z","updated_at":"2016-05-03T18:33:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@aljoscha can we rerun somehow build?

Furthermore, we should add a test case for the original problem.\n\nApart from that, the changes look good and +1 for merging.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/216816200/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/216825461","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1941#issuecomment-216825461","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1941","id":216825461,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNjgyNTQ2MQ==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-04T10:41:53Z","updated_at":"2016-05-04T10:41:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the update @fpompermaier.

This requires unrolling an additional half-step after the iteration concludes. If we start by computing authority, then alternatively compute hub and authority in the iteration (such that authority is the iteration output), then we need to do one further computation of hub which can be outer-joined with the authority.\n\n2) Would this be better as a GSA algorithm which would use a combiner to reduce the scores?

Value updating and normalization limit the two phased can not be handled in the same `superstep`. IMO, we can cache the hub updating result and send them to next authority iteration and package final authority and hub value as `Tuple2` type to return. What's your opinion on this?\n2) GSA does not support for choosing edge direction and each vertex will be updated based on the values of its in-neighbors only. In the implementation, hub updating use the value of target vertex where the edge direction is out, authority updating used the value of the value of source vertex where the edge direction is in. IMO, it does not work for hub updating procedure if used GSA.\n3)Yes, vertices have been initialized in the test. It should be better to be set into the algortithm before the first iteration using `Graph.translateVertexValues`.\n4) Because the edge value not used, the translation is optional and it can keep its original value and type.\n5) Yes, adding threshold may reduce iteration time for the case of small graph with great `maxIteration`. (Does the scatter-gather or GSA have a default threshold to check for no value updating during the iteration?)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/217070480/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/217093665","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1156#issuecomment-217093665","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1156","id":217093665,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNzA5MzY2NQ==","user":{"login":"chobeat","id":2822010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MjIwMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2822010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chobeat","html_url":"https://github.com/chobeat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chobeat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chobeat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chobeat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chobeat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chobeat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chobeat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chobeat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chobeat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chobeat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-05T07:33:15Z","updated_at":"2016-05-05T07:33:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"any news?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/217093665/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/217094415","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1156#issuecomment-217094415","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1156","id":217094415,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNzA5NDQxNQ==","user":{"login":"MoeweX","id":5738978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Mzg5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5738978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoeweX","html_url":"https://github.com/MoeweX","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoeweX/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoeweX/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoeweX/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoeweX/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoeweX/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoeweX/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoeweX/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoeweX/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoeweX/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-05T07:38:32Z","updated_at":"2016-05-05T07:38:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Not since three months ago.

you are correct that you're job failed since the previous one wasn't cleaned up yet. Should you try to run 2 identical jobs in parallel it will fail, since 2 jobs would use the same metrics due to name clashes. Note that in this version this also occurs when 2 operators have the same name. I have some additional functionality coming up that would allow you to circumvent this issue.\n\n@ankitcha The problem with multiple reporters is our configuration, it only supports single-line key-value pairs, and you need to know the exact key to access it. In order to configure multiple reporters you would either need a nested structure (which is not supportet), or index the configuration keys (metrics.reporter.1.class) and add a new parameter containing the indices to use (e.g. metrics.reporter: 0, 1), which isn't particularly user-friendly. The metric system itself could deal with multiple reporters with minor modifications; it's all about the configuration.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/217368732/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/217373539","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1962#issuecomment-217373539","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1962","id":217373539,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNzM3MzUzOQ==","user":{"login":"rmetzger","id":89049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger","html_url":"https://github.com/rmetzger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-06T07:53:01Z","updated_at":"2016-05-06T07:53:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"How did you test/try out the code you've implemented in this pull request?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/217373539/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/217389510","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1947#issuecomment-217389510","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1947","id":217389510,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNzM4OTUxMA==","user":{"login":"rmetzger","id":89049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger","html_url":"https://github.com/rmetzger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-06T08:58:52Z","updated_at":"2016-05-06T08:58:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Okay.
