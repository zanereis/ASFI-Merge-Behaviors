This led to metrics proliferation. \r\n\r\nFrom kafka (or any other stream) point of view, if they are trying to emit per-partition consumer metrics, it probably makes sense that they add different metrics for each consumer so as to get the health of the system  correctly. So, we need to handle it somehow.\r\n\r\nOne way could be that when we implement an internal \"queue\" of state transitions, holding the consuming transition until the ONLINE transition is received. Of course, we will have to respond back OK for the consuming state transition, but just not allow our software to handle it. A little tricky to implement, and sounds somewhat hacky to me. Also has a downside that we will be responding OK without actually handling the state transition. Helix does not provide a way to mark a transition in ERROR from the participant. We could ask for that feature (useful for other things as well), and then we can mark the consumer in ERROR state if it later fails to transition correctly.\r\n\r\nA simple work-around in the short/medium term may be we stop realtime table creation in the controller if the max-threads is not set to at least 2 (we don't expect to have more than one outstanding state transition for the same partition).\r\n\r\nI am open to hearing other ideas on how to fix the deadlock.\r\n ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/693104377/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/693744923","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/6026#issuecomment-693744923","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/6026","id":693744923,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5Mzc0NDkyMw==","user":{"login":"suvodeep-pyne","id":2577714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc3MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/suvodeep-pyne","html_url":"https://github.com/suvodeep-pyne","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suvodeep-pyne/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suvodeep-pyne/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suvodeep-pyne/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suvodeep-pyne/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suvodeep-pyne/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suvodeep-pyne/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suvodeep-pyne/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suvodeep-pyne/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suvodeep-pyne/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-17T01:01:10Z","updated_at":"2020-09-17T01:01:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think IntelliJ did some magic when moving those files.

This is without regards to later table adds (which would not be bootstrap). Make sense?\r\n\r\nYes, I agree with that expectation. Perhaps I don't have a clear picture of the overall solution (since the PR says WIP). So I have a few questions:\r\n- I take it that the usage model is only for dev/test environment, and not really being proposed for production. Is this accurate?\r\n\r\n- Does the proposal involve making changes to the service (to not return healthy status, or something similar), until `ServiceManager` has successfully bootstrapped the tables? If not, great. But if so, this is the part I am having trouble with, as I do not think it is right for a dev/test utility to govern what defines `healthy` status of the service. Also, it opens up questions like, is the service healthy once table is created, or data is uploaded, or data is actually ONLINE in external view to be served (and if so, what happens if one of the segments fails to load).\r\n\r\nWe have similar issue in our integration test, where we have to wait until the table is bootstrapped, before running test queries (eg `OfflineClusterIntegrationTest`). There, the hack is to wait until `count(*)` returns expected count (not necessarily recommending this, just pointing out).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/700412009/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/700421545","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/6039#issuecomment-700421545","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/6039","id":700421545,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwMDQyMTU0NQ==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-29T04:38:49Z","updated_at":"2020-09-29T04:38:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"WRT
