Let me briefly introduce myself. I'm a CS undergrad at CMU. I am interested in learning about iceberg & AWS and making some contributions to this project. I asked @jackye1995 for some suggestions, and he recommended me to add configurations for `Apache HTTP Client`. Hence, in this PR, I would like to expose all simple settings of `Apache HTTP Client`. Based on my understanding, one important reason for some users to choose `Apache HTTP Client` is that it has more functionality and customizable settings than `URL Connection`. Thus, I think exposing these settings can allow users to take advantage of `Apache HTTP Client`’s power as needed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1267332870/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1267348110","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/5862#issuecomment-1267348110","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/5862","id":1267348110,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85LijKO","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-04T17:46:48Z","updated_at":"2022-10-04T17:46:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@danielcweeks, can you help review this as well since you reviewed the original PR?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1267348110/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1267510359","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/5908#issuecomment-1267510359","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/5908","id":1267510359,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85LjKxX","user":{"login":"findepi","id":144328,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDMyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/144328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/findepi","html_url":"https://github.com/findepi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/findepi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/findepi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/findepi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/findepi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/findepi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/findepi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/findepi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/findepi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/findepi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-04T19:57:07Z","updated_at":"2022-10-04T19:57:07Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thank you @rdblue for your review.

concerned about the introduction of ambiguity to the `__repr__` with this change. Namely, the `__repr__` of both a `DoubleLiteral(1.0)` and a `FloatLiteral(1.0)` would become `literal(1.0)`, which in turn evaluates to a `DoubleLiteral(1.0)`. Hence, the `__repr__` becomes ambiguous with respect to the class of the original object and it will not recreate the same object for the case of the `FloatLiteral`.

`FixedLiteral`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1269496873/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1269601487","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/5927#issuecomment-1269601487","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/5927","id":1269601487,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85LrJTP","user":{"login":"rbalamohan","id":7969713,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5Njk3MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7969713?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbalamohan","html_url":"https://github.com/rbalamohan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbalamohan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbalamohan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbalamohan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbalamohan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbalamohan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbalamohan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbalamohan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbalamohan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbalamohan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-06T08:43:53Z","updated_at":"2022-10-06T08:43:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"For

For example, the conversion `LongLiteral(1234) -> FloatLiteral(1234.0)` will become a `literal(1234) -> literal(1234.0)`. While we are technically able to see that some conversion is happening, we have to spot the change in `.0` and we still don't know whether it's a `FloatLiteral` or `DoubleLiteral`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1271153715/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1271156134","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/5916#issuecomment-1271156134","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/5916","id":1271156134,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85LxE2m","user":{"login":"nastra","id":271029,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MTAyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/271029?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra","html_url":"https://github.com/nastra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-07T06:14:21Z","updated_at":"2022-10-07T06:14:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/5933 ports this back to 1.0.x","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1271156134/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1271192157","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/5893#issuecomment-1271192157","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/5893","id":1271192157,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85LxNpd","user":{"login":"sumeetgajjar","id":7351922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNTE5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7351922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar","html_url":"https://github.com/sumeetgajjar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-07T07:05:18Z","updated_at":"2022-10-07T07:05:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Thanks, @sumeetgajjar.

about how the data has evolved -- specifically that position-based column resolution is valid (just like CSV with no header). This works for top-level columns, but it won't work for correctness with nested fields. With position-based column resolution, you can add columns to the end of the schema safely. So you can have some files with columns `1: a, 2: b` and some with columns `1: a, 2: b, 3: c` (note that ID assignment is consistent). The problem with nested columns is that the top-level field assignment can change the assignment for nested fields. For example: `1: a struct<3: x, 4: y>, 2: b` and `1: a struct<4: x, 5: y>, 2: b, 3: c`.\r\n\r\nI think what you probably want is to use a name mapping, which is more flexible and can probably handle what you want to do.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1272077852/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1272101180","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/5932#issuecomment-1272101180","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/5932","id":1272101180,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85L0rk8","user":{"login":"the-other-tim-brown","id":1360517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjA1MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1360517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-other-tim-brown","html_url":"https://github.com/the-other-tim-brown","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-other-tim-brown/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-other-tim-brown/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-other-tim-brown/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-other-tim-brown/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-other-tim-brown/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-other-tim-brown/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-other-tim-brown/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-other-tim-brown/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-other-tim-brown/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-07T21:29:12Z","updated_at":"2022-10-07T22:44:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@rdblue to add some more context, I'm trying to bootstrap an Iceberg table from existing Parquet files and when reading these files from spark I hit this [line](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/master/parquet/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/parquet/ReadConf.java#L91) in the ReadConf.
