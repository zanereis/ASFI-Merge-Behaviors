when RocketDB starts writing the cq(RocksDBConsumeQueueStore#bufferDRList) offset, there are scenarios where the cq data in memory hasn't been fully persisted.

### Which Issue(s) This PR Fixes\r\n> Fixes [#8742 ](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/8742)\r\n> \r\n> ### Brief Description\r\n> * Modified the retry mechanism to use the workflow_run event instead of manual rerun.\r\n> * Resolved permission issues preventing retry on PR submission.\r\n> * Improved automation and stability of unit tests.\r\n> \r\n> ### How Did You Test This Change?\r\n> I tested the change by submitting a PR to my own repository and deliberately introducing errors to check if the retry mechanism would trigger. The result was successful, confirming that the retry function works as intended.\r\n> \r\n> [The test workflow](https://github.com/chi3316/rocketmq/actions/runs/11009360256/job/30568890778?pr=3)\r\n> \r\n> ![image](https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/110283895/370504578-3b6f0abe-921a-4c9d-acf9-6b050c67dce8.png?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJnaXRodWIuY29tIiwiYXVkIjoicmF3LmdpdGh1YnVzZXJjb250ZW50LmNvbSIsImtleSI6ImtleTUiLCJleHAiOjE3MjcyMzAzMzcsIm5iZiI6MTcyNzIzMDAzNywicGF0aCI6Ii8xMTAyODM4OTUvMzcwNTA0NTc4LTNiNmYwYWJlLTkyMWEtNGM5ZC1hY2Y5LTZiMDUwYzY3ZGNlOC5wbmc_WC1BbXotQWxnb3JpdGhtPUFXUzQtSE1BQy1TSEEyNTYmWC1BbXotQ3JlZGVudGlhbD1BS0lBVkNPRFlMU0E1M1BRSzRaQSUyRjIwMjQwOTI1JTJGdXMtZWFzdC0xJTJGczMlMkZhd3M0X3JlcXVlc3QmWC1BbXotRGF0ZT0yMDI0MDkyNVQwMjA3MTdaJlgtQW16LUV4cGlyZXM9MzAwJlgtQW16LVNpZ25hdHVyZT0wYzUwNDk5MzBlMDU4MzNhN2FlMTI2ODlmNDg5ZGJlMjZhYTJlZjc1YTMxZTA3ZDk0NmU2MTk0ZjE4NmI1ZWRhJlgtQW16LVNpZ25lZEhlYWRlcnM9aG9zdCJ9.4wqXaUrSSt5Tho4vwEPTunGVvk-6A1KUZa523Ttds6I)\r\n\r\nGood job","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/2372740692/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/2372845418","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/8746#issuecomment-2372845418","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/8746","id":2372845418,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl86Nbr9q","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-25T03:39:35Z","updated_at":"2024-12-08T10:57:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## [Codecov](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/rocketmq/pull/8746?dropdown=coverage&src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=apache) Report\nAttention: Patch coverage is `57.89474%` with `16 lines` in your changes missing coverage.
