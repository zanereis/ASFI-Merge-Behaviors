The implementation would still use a batch scanner (or scanner with a special iterator but its harder to pass code to tserver).   Each input split could call a function like the following which deterministically creates a set of ranges.   Then those ranges could be used for the batch scanner. \n\n``` java\ninterface RangeGenerator {\n  /**\n   * @param tabletRange  The data range for the tablet over which the input split is executing\n   * @param config a mysterious class that allows user to pass parameters to the function\n   */\n  List<Range> createRanges(Range tabletRange, Myst config);\n}\n```\n\nWhen configuring the AccumuloInputFormat to use the batch scanner, a class name that implements this function would be provided.   The ranges set on the job would be large ranges for portions of table to process.  An input split would be created for each tablet that falls within those large ranges, and for each input split the function would be called to possibly create many more ranges.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/91033820/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/91035731","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/25#issuecomment-91035731","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/25","id":91035731,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDkxMDM1NzMx","user":{"login":"joshelser","id":67863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3ODYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser","html_url":"https://github.com/joshelser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-08T20:58:50Z","updated_at":"2015-04-08T20:58:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":">  It seems like this change could encourage users to pass many ranges as configuration for the map reduce job.

If anything, it this these changes would reduce the total number of objects in memory (as a split could contain multiple ranges whereas previously it was 1:1). I remember hearing about solutions that use HDFS as a mechanism for supporting large numbers of ranges instead of the Configuration.

However, what Eugene has already done is already an improvement over what currently exists, IMO. Assuming that the majority of Ranges that his Spark workflow creates are non-overlapping (a hunch given the subject matter -- very small boxes of interest), this still reduces the total memory use of splits and Ranges. The worst case would be numerous very large ranges. We're never going to have the ideal solution the first time around -- I just don't want this to stall because we come up with a different solution to an already solved problem.\n\nI'm happy to continue the discussion for dealing with large numbers of ranges efficiently, I'm just not convinced this is the place to do it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/91041003/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/91043317","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/25#issuecomment-91043317","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/25","id":91043317,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDkxMDQzMzE3","user":{"login":"wjsl","id":1318885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTg4ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1318885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wjsl","html_url":"https://github.com/wjsl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wjsl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wjsl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wjsl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wjsl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wjsl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wjsl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wjsl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wjsl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wjsl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-08T21:36:47Z","updated_at":"2015-04-08T21:36:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> It seems like this change could encourage users to pass many ranges as configuration for the map reduce job.\n\nThe current InputFormat already does this, so I don't think it's a big deal that this patch doesn't address this.

The Range -> List<Range> interface does not have enough parameters to determine the query plan. Also, if the query is user generated then a named class can not be present to encapsulate the parameters.\n\nFrom this standpoint it seems there are two options \n- Use some presence that is that would be populated by the query planner\n  - Perhaps the Configuration object would still need a value to find the correct location\n- Expand the interface to to include some kind of `QueryConfiguration` interface that could be implemented by the user and would be passed in.\n\nThe second approach sounds more interesting but it's hard to judge it since I don't think I have that problem. \n\nTo clarify, what is the underlying concern, that the Configuration object gets too large and the (de)serialization becomes too expensive or not even possible?\n\nMy particular use case is reflection on the fact that small ranges introduce too much overhead when they translate to mappers (in MR) and partitions (in spark). So it would be nice if there is some kind of minimum batch, tablet maps nicely to that.\n\nThe only other addition to this problem, which is not explored in this PR, is to divide sequence of ranges per tablet server into \"balanced\", user configurable, number, of groups. Balanced in this case could mean something like: approximately equal number of possible row results. The idea would to be to match \"x mappers per host\" design. Sounds like it would be great, but I haven't tested anything like that yet, could be another PR if it works out?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/91641526/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/91645846","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/25#issuecomment-91645846","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/25","id":91645846,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDkxNjQ1ODQ2","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-10T18:29:52Z","updated_at":"2015-04-10T18:29:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[Accumulo-Pull-Requests
