Which may be a SerializedThrowable (if it originated at the workers) or not (if it originated at the JobManager, such as missing resources).\n\nThe client would still need to check and deserialize like it does now.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/135769165/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/135769797","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1048#issuecomment-135769797","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1048","id":135769797,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNTc2OTc5Nw==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-28T13:07:54Z","updated_at":"2015-08-28T13:07:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The

I assume that there are situations where your data is still skewed even after distributing it onto two different consumers.\n\nIt would be great if you could add another test which tests the functioning of the partitioner in a more applied scenario, if possible.

Let me address your question one by one:\n\n> Why did you decide to start the JobManager alongside the Scheduler?\n\nThis is basically a \"easy\" first step way of getting things running the way it was done in a whole bunch of projects. The easiest way to run a \"single\" master + multiple worker application is to make the scheduler run the master process and have another meta-framework such as marathon submit the whole framework as a task to the mesos server. In the lack of marathon or aurora etc, mesos-submit ( an app that ships with mesos) can be used to submit the scheduler as a task. This means the job manager + scheduler would be running in the mesos cluster submitted as an app (just like in YARN).\n\nMy eventual goal is to make the scheduler support a completely standalone mode of operation but that requires coordination in order to assure that only one scheduler instance exists at a time - this may have some hooks that can be a part of the HA job manager initiative.\n\n> Tests\n\nI am working on some docker and vagrant based scripts that can make the \"setup\" part of the tests more palatable.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/136236719/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/136241503","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1046#issuecomment-136241503","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1046","id":136241503,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNjI0MTUwMw==","user":{"login":"ffbin","id":13081808,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDgxODA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13081808?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffbin","html_url":"https://github.com/ffbin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffbin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffbin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffbin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffbin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffbin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffbin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffbin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffbin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffbin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-31T03:18:17Z","updated_at":"2015-08-31T03:18:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mjsax @StephanEwen I have finish the code changes.\n1.serialize Storm Config as a byte[] into the Flink configuration\n2.extend ExclamationTopology such that the number of added !in ExclamationBolt and ExclamationWithStormSpout.ExclamationMap is configurable and adapt the tests.\n3.extend FiniteStormFileSpout and base class with an empty constructor and configure the file to be opened via Storm configuration Map.\nI have run flink-storm-compatibility test successfully in local machine and do not know why CI failed.\nCan you have a look at my code?

But what about the rest? Wouldn't it be nice to have a partitioner which works for all? How hard would it be to generalize your approach? We could set the default number of distributing channels to 2 to mimic your initial implementation.\n\nConcerning the test, you could for example create a `DataStream` which only contains a single key. Then you group on this key and then apply some other operation where you use the `PartialPartitioner`. In this latter operation you can assign the sub index of the task which processes the elements. Having this index, you should be able to calculate the distribution of the data.

Here are a few comments:\n- Exception during `open()` should not be caught, but should fail the test. This happens at multiple points in the code.\n- The test contains a class that starts with a lower case letter, which is against the Java style rules.\n- The test as a whole extends `RichSinkFunction` which is not necessary and seems strange.\n- The mock print stream overwrites only one `println()` function, which makes it susceptible to changes in the sink. It is better to use a regular `PrintStream` that prints to a `StringWriter` to collect all contents.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/136667496/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
