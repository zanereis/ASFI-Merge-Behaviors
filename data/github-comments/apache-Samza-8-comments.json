The idea is awesome. I actually think that we can be even more lazier: no start() function in the SystemAdmins(), and only do systemAdmin.start() when the getSysteAdmin() is called. That way we don't need to start the admin it if the system is not being used. This is actually the case in Beam: I configured the kafka system as default system for intermediate topics, but it's not being used in beam tests since we only have 1 task (no repartition needed). Now after upgrading to 0.14.1, I saw the kafka admin getting created and constantly logging warnings about broker not available. I would suggest keeping the old behavior and only create the admin when used.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/393383907/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/393612905","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/samza/pull/512#issuecomment-393612905","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/512","id":393612905,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MzYxMjkwNQ==","user":{"login":"cameronlee314","id":37879374,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3ODc5Mzc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37879374?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronlee314","html_url":"https://github.com/cameronlee314","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronlee314/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronlee314/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronlee314/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronlee314/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronlee314/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronlee314/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronlee314/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronlee314/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronlee314/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-31T17:36:28Z","updated_at":"2018-05-31T17:36:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"SystemAdmins.getSystemAdmin() gets called throughout the lifecycle of the container (e.g. startup, commit). We are reusing SystemAdmin instances, so do we want to be calling SystemAdmin.start() every time someone wants a SystemAdmin? That seems a bit inconsistent with the normal start/stop usage pattern.\r\nFor the problem you are seeing in Beam: By the time Samza needs to instantiate the SystemAdmin instances, does Samza know if the default system will actually get used? Or is there some \"runtime\" usage of the default system that can't be detected at start time? If we can detect that the default system will never actually be used, we could avoid instantiating that system in the first place.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/393612905/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/393708308","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/samza/pull/518#issuecomment-393708308","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/518","id":393708308,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MzcwODMwOA==","user":{"login":"rayman7718","id":1349417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDk0MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1349417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayman7718","html_url":"https://github.com/rayman7718","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayman7718/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayman7718/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayman7718/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayman7718/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayman7718/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayman7718/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayman7718/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayman7718/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayman7718/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-31T22:56:22Z","updated_at":"2018-05-31T22:56:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"As
