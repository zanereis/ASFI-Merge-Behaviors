The main issue that we've had with migrations on SQLite is that constraints, once set on a table, cannot be altered. Even the `batch_alter_table` system doesn't provide a workaround. This leads to a lot of try/except blocks in our migration files, and thus schema drift between production systems. It's really painful to try to figure out what different organizations have as an underlying schema right now.\r\n\r\nI don't see it mentioned here in the history, so I should mention that this SIP has gone through the Apache voting process and has been approved.
