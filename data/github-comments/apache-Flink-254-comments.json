For proctime and 'from-source' columns, we can just ignore them when building the sink schema. Maybe, we should have some helper method for building the schema for source and sink separately.

I think timestamp fields of source-sink tables should be handled as follows when emitting the table:\r\n- `proc-time`: ignore\r\n- `from-field`: simply write out the timestamp as part of the row.\r\n- `from-source`: write the timestamp separately to the system and remove it from the row. This only works if we can set the timestamp to the sink system. If the system sets the ingestion timestamp by it own, i.e., not the actual value, rows would contain different timestamps when they are ingested. If the sink system does not support to set a timestamp, we cannot allow such a table definition.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/401360822/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/401361583","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6132#issuecomment-401361583","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6132","id":401361583,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMTM2MTU4Mw==","user":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-29T13:55:18Z","updated_at":"2018-06-29T13:55:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks a lot @sihuazhou.

In `from-source`, the only system i know of is Kafka10 or Kafka11, which support writing record along with timestamp. To support `from-source` in table sink, I think we can do the following:\r\n1) add a connector property, e.g. connector.support-timestamp. Only if connector.support-timestamp is true, we will allow the sink table schema to contain a field with rowtime type `from-source`. Otherwise, an exception will be thrown.\r\n2) if the condition in 1) is satisfied, we will create corresponding rowtime field in the sink table schema with type LONG, in TableEnvironment.insertInto(), we will validate the sink schema against the insertion source. Also, in the TableSink.emitDataStream() implementation, we will need to insert an timestamp assigner operator to set StreamRecord.timestamp (should we reuse existing interface, or create a new timestampInserter interface?) and remove the extra rowtime field from StreamRecord.value before we emit the datastream to the sink. (for kafkaTableSink, we will also need to invoke setWriteTimestampToKafka(true))\r\n\r\nPlease correct me if I missed something here.

@zentol, I have one remark (see above), besides that looks good to me!\r\n\r\nAdditionally I had some ideas that came to mind that I think we could discuss:\r\n- We have a common pattern of `wait_for_sth` functions, that either\r\n  - get stuck in a loop for ever if the desired event doesn't happen (I think `wait_for_job_state_transition` also behaves like that, right?)\r\n  - or iterate a fixed number of times and then continue execution, whereas instead they should fail.\r\nI think we should add an issue for that to refactor that over all the tests to have consistent and useful behaviour\r\n- Also I think that we could have the backup config and revert config as part of the test runner  and always do that, so we avoid running into a corrupted flink-dist if tests don't behave

Whether the connector supports writing a system timestamp can be an internal field/annotation/interface of the `TableSink` that is generated from the properties.\r\n- Copying the timestamp to the StreamRecord timestamp field can be done with a process function. Actually, we do that already when converting a Table into a DataStream. Setting the flag in the Kafka TableSink should be easy.\r\n- Not sure if `from-source` needs to be supported by the initial version. We could just implement `from-field` for now, and handle `from-source` as a follow up issue. Since we are approaching feature freeze, I think this might be a good idea at this point.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\nFabian","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/402081329/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/402081801","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6216#issuecomment-402081801","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6216","id":402081801,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMjA4MTgwMQ==","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-03T09:43:49Z","updated_at":"2018-07-03T09:43:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"merging.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/402081801/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/402087531","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6242#issuecomment-402087531","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6242","id":402087531,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMjA4NzUzMQ==","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-03T09:59:23Z","updated_at":"2018-07-03T09:59:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"-1\r\n\r\nThe PR description is outdated, the CLI only lists jobs in non-terminal states as running, i.e. CANCELED, FAILED and FINISHED jobs are not included.
