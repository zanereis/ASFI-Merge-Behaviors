There may be other implications of that, so that should be done first, as its own task, before implementing the above.\r\n\r\nAn alternative might be to simply use fewer watchers in the first place, by changing the design for table config updates to use a single global watcher on a single field, named something like \"/configChanged\" which is updated on every config update, and guards every config read. This strategy would reduce the number of watchers as a whole, and would also work on the current version of ZK we use.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/520902882/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/520905301","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1220#issuecomment-520905301","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1220","id":520905301,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMDkwNTMwMQ==","user":{"login":"jzgithub1","id":5930146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MzAxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5930146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1","html_url":"https://github.com/jzgithub1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-13T16:21:17Z","updated_at":"2019-08-13T16:21:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @ctubbsii .

Keeping the config non-breaking for current users, and the behavior when the port is specified in both locations would be figure out and define.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/522695821/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/522784431","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/1329#issuecomment-522784431","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1329","id":522784431,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMjc4NDQzMQ==","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-19T22:54:12Z","updated_at":"2019-08-19T22:54:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"As follow-on, NativeMap, NMIterator, and ConcurrentIterator in NativeMap.java could all be made AutoCloseable, and the close method replace the delete methods.

The fix will be in 1.9.4, but it's a trivial backport to 1.9.3.\r\n\r\nActually, this sounds related to #854 / #860 / #1008 ; not sure if the fix in 8b6aaa57126ed1f1fe6e8485c7bd559ff64f9b54 would be easy to backport to 1.9.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/524953171/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/524964248","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1336#issuecomment-524964248","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1336","id":524964248,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNDk2NDI0OA==","user":{"login":"adamjshook","id":1372828,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzI4Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1372828?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamjshook","html_url":"https://github.com/adamjshook","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamjshook/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamjshook/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamjshook/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamjshook/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamjshook/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamjshook/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamjshook/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamjshook/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamjshook/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-26T18:03:22Z","updated_at":"2019-08-26T18:03:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The GC is running on its typical 5 minute interval and reporting a large number of candidates; seems to be in working order.

for looking into this, @BukrosSzabolcs . This is an interesting feature.\r\n\r\nHowever, a lot has changed since that issue was last discussed over 6 years ago. I'm not finding a compelling need for it today (but could be convinced). In my view, it is trivial for a user to implement such a thing by simply having their own naming convention for deleted tables, and taking them offline. This change would introduce a lot of extra code, increasing complexity, without a lot of value (not anything a user can't already do today quite easily and entirely from the client side).\r\n\r\nPerhaps a more useful feature might be to add \"table tags\", to assist the user in tagging tables with user-defined tags, like a `deleted` tag or a `date_deleted` tag? Those could be stored very trivially in the ZooKeeper node information for a table, and retrieved with simple APIs, without a lot of code. It could enable complex user requirements like identifying when a table was deleted, but without us having to grow Accumulo complexity much. Generic table tags could also support lots of other user features, like `created_by` or `created_on` or `delete_after` or whatever.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/525953300/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/525970720","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1308#issuecomment-525970720","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1308","id":525970720,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNTk3MDcyMA==","user":{"login":"EdColeman","id":7047700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDc3MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7047700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman","html_url":"https://github.com/EdColeman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-29T00:16:55Z","updated_at":"2019-08-29T00:16:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I pulled the changes from the other branch and created a separate pull request with just the test changes.

If you want to see if this code changed things in a meaningful way, you'll probably need to do some controlled experiments with various sizes and settings to demonstrate (or disprove) improved throughput with the change(s). A good experiment will also eliminate the JVM startup times as a variable by avoiding using MiniAccumuloInstance (used by ReadWriteIT), and would run with several tservers (to ensure the binning part of the batch writer is exercised, since that's a relevant code path for the question of throughput).\r\n\r\n> I will look at the TabletServerBatchWriter class a little more deeply to see if I can come up with any better ideas on how to improve throughput. I will comment on issue #1120 in the issue thread instead of the pull request from now on.\r\n\r\nThe ideas in this PR don't seem to be very similar to the 2-layer queuing strategy described in the old JIRA issue linked on #1120. Have you attempted to implement that design proposed in that ticket at all? It could be implemented alongside the existing BatchWriter, as a new API, instead of modifying the current one. And, if it turns out to be higher performance, we can either swap in the new implementation, or deprecate the old API in favor of the new one.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/527691138/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/527969188","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1120#issuecomment-527969188","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1120","id":527969188,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNzk2OTE4OA==","user":{"login":"jzgithub1","id":5930146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MzAxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5930146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1","html_url":"https://github.com/jzgithub1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-04T16:02:56Z","updated_at":"2019-09-04T19:05:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I am disengaging from this effort until after the 2.1.0 release so I can concentrate on the issues of that release.

If any code relied on those being wrapped, such code could fail or behave incorrectly, when it tries to unwrap the `AccumuloException` now thrown here.
