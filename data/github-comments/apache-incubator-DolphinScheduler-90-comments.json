@CalvinKirs, the 3 remaining bugs are from the DAG file in the common project.

Can I remove the `volatile` keyword or is there a better way to make it work?\r\n\r\nI'm also trying to increase the code coverage to get it over 33% but there are some tests that are ignored are not letting the codes I added to get covered. Please advice about what to do here.\r\n\r\nThe 53 vulnerabilities are from files I refactored to fix code vulnerabilities previously reported by sonar.
