So we need to fix that as well in `ManifestEntriesTable`:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n     protected CloseableIterable<FileScanTask> planFiles(\r\n         TableOperations ops, Snapshot snapshot, Expression rowFilter, boolean caseSensitive, boolean colStats) {\r\n       CloseableIterable<ManifestFile> manifests = CloseableIterable.withNoopClose(snapshot.manifests());\r\n-      Schema fileSchema = new Schema(schema().findType(\"data_file\").asStructType().fields());\r\n+      Type fileProjection = schema().findType(\"data_file\");\r\n+      Schema fileSchema = fileProjection != null ? new Schema(fileProjection.asStructType().fields()) : new Schema();\r\n       String schemaString = SchemaParser.toJson(schema());\r\n       String specString = PartitionSpecParser.toJson(PartitionSpec.unpartitioned());\r\n       ResidualEvaluator residuals = ResidualEvaluator.unpartitioned(rowFilter);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter that, adding this to the entries table test case works:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    Assert.assertEquals(\"Count should return 1\",\r\n        1, spark.read().format(\"iceberg\").load(loadLocation(tableIdentifier, \"entries\")).count());\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/636205153/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/636206078","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/1078#issuecomment-636206078","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1078","id":636206078,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzNjIwNjA3OA==","user":{"login":"asheeshgarg","id":4348671,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDg2NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4348671?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asheeshgarg","html_url":"https://github.com/asheeshgarg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asheeshgarg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asheeshgarg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asheeshgarg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asheeshgarg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asheeshgarg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asheeshgarg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asheeshgarg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asheeshgarg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asheeshgarg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-29T21:46:51Z","updated_at":"2020-05-29T21:46:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Just like we have in Spark MLLib Sparse and dense representation. \r\nAnother thing if we don't store the values if its null while reading the data it will return the default values.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/636206078/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/636208751","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1079#issuecomment-636208751","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1079","id":636208751,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzNjIwODc1MQ==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-29T21:51:58Z","updated_at":"2020-05-29T21:51:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Merging to fix master.

I wouldn't say that there are too many asserts, although I don't think you need to validate both the files in the snapshot and each manifest separately.\r\n\r\nThe main thing is to make sure any assumption you're making is validated. For example, if you validate the contents of `snapshot.manifests().get(0)` then you also need to check that there is only one manifest, or that you're checking the manifest you expect.\r\n\r\nAlso, many of these tests need to check other conditions in addition to the sequence numbers -- that's why it's important to add sequence numbers to the existing tests instead of adding a few new tests. For example, the tests for `MergeAppend` need to make assertions about what manifests were merged and the contents of each manifest, in addition to the sequence numbers of the manifests and every entry in the manifest (because of the merge).\r\n\r\nI'm going to go ahead and merge this into master since it looks like there are a lot of checks. Then we can remove these tests when the operation test suites are updated to cover the same cases.\r\n\r\nThanks for working on this, it's a big help to have someone looking into this area and adding tests for sequence numbers.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/637844679/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/637856030","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/199#issuecomment-637856030","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/199","id":637856030,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzNzg1NjAzMA==","user":{"login":"edgarRd","id":266670,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjY3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/266670?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd","html_url":"https://github.com/edgarRd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-02T23:16:08Z","updated_at":"2020-06-02T23:16:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @rdblue, @rdsr and @shardulm94 for the review!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/637856030/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/637857449","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/197#issuecomment-637857449","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/197","id":637857449,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzNzg1NzQ0OQ==","user":{"login":"edgarRd","id":266670,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjY3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/266670?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd","html_url":"https://github.com/edgarRd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-02T23:20:55Z","updated_at":"2020-06-02T23:20:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"We can close this, fixed in #199.

Ryan\r\nIceberg uses columnar formats that help, but doesn't automatically convert to a sparse representation if that's what you're referring to. -> Yes\r\n\r\nSo currently what is happening I have 32K records of 40K columns in this case 80% of columns have a null value.\r\nif I persist this spark dataframe as csv roughly data comes out to 4 gb and it takes 4 min to persist the data in s3 bucket.\r\nif I persist this spark dataframe as parquet as as iceberg roughly data comes out to 19 MB and it takes 8 min to persist the data in s3 bucket.\r\nI tried uncompressed codec for parquet but timing doesn't improved.\r\nI feel the time is taken mostly in internal datastruture of parquet like dictionary encoding and other optimization for columnar data store.\r\nWhat I was referring is there a way to drop these 80% columns as they are null during storage which will significantly reduce the write time using some sparse storage technique.  \r\nSo while reading back we can return default value for the columns.\r\nAny suggestion will be really helpful.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/638198029/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/638337544","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/1091#issuecomment-638337544","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1091","id":638337544,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzODMzNzU0NA==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-03T17:19:42Z","updated_at":"2020-06-03T17:19:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"We're

It'd be fine if you think a Hive Table would be better because of its popularity. I guess it'd be easy to add one more hive container here. \r\n\r\n**(2) How often do we need to update the docker?**\r\n\r\nI think there may exist two choices:\r\n\r\n* Update the docker in every Iceberg's building process. In this way, users can always try the latest Iceberg built from the master branch, which may enable users and developers try new features as soon as possible.\r\n* Update the docker in every Iceberg's stable release. It's like what I'm doing now, downloading from the stable release from apache's repository. The docker will be updated only when Iceberg releases a new version.\r\n\r\nPersonally I'm in favor of the second option, which can already satisfy a new user's needs from my perspective.\r\n\r\n**(3) Features included in the docker demo**\r\n\r\nThe current user guide in [README.md](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/0a92afae5263ccbd608de0efdc646ab479fb9638/docker/README.md) is a temporary version for committers to review the codes, and I'm going to find a more popular scenario and more data for Iceberg's starters (I appreciate any help about this).\r\n\r\nI'm still a newbie to Iceberg, so maybe I'm not very clear about the most important feature of Iceberg. Table Evolution and Time Travel are the best in my mind.

We actually don't need to have a name node and data node. After all, the docker will be used for a quick demo. \r\nAnd for the hdfs we can think of mount the container with the host, so data can be available from the container.\r\n\r\n\r\n> **(1) Should we use Hive Table or Hadoop Table in the docker demo?**\r\n> \r\n> Currently I'm using the Hadoop Table and Spark to demonstrate the writing process. It'd be fine if you think a Hive Table would be better because of its popularity. I guess it'd be easy to add one more hive container here.\r\n\r\n+1 to add Hive, so we can test it all Iceberg features.\r\n\r\n> **(2) How often do we need to update the docker?**\r\n> \r\n> I think there may exist two choices:\r\n> \r\n> * Update the docker in every Iceberg's building process. In this way, users can always try the latest Iceberg built from the master branch, which may enable users and developers try new features as soon as possible.\r\n> * Update the docker in every Iceberg's stable release. It's like what I'm doing now, downloading from the stable release from apache's repository. The docker will be updated only when Iceberg releases a new version.\r\n\r\nDockerHub can trigger the build after each commit made in Iceberg repository. But we need to link them both. \r\nI think the best way is to download the dockerfile and build the image locally with the target Hadoop, Hive, and Spark version.\r\n\r\n> **(3) Features included in the docker demo**\r\n> \r\n> The current user guide in [README.md](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/0a92afae5263ccbd608de0efdc646ab479fb9638/docker/README.md) is a temporary version for committers to review the codes, and I'm going to find a more popular scenario and more data for Iceberg's starters (I appreciate any help about this).\r\n\r\nI think just the getting start tutorial with iceberg-docker is enough! It's up to the user to try Iceberg and build some quick PoC.\r\n \r\n> **(4) Will the docker demo demonstrated on the website?**  \r\n\r\nA getting start with docker would be nice!\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/640137500/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/640392633","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1097#issuecomment-640392633","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1097","id":640392633,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MDM5MjYzMw==","user":{"login":"vanliu-tx","id":64360028,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MzYwMDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64360028?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanliu-tx","html_url":"https://github.com/vanliu-tx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanliu-tx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanliu-tx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanliu-tx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanliu-tx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanliu-tx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanliu-tx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanliu-tx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanliu-tx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanliu-tx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-08T06:16:39Z","updated_at":"2020-06-08T06:16:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rdblue,

there, some context on why #933 was paused for a month - in developing it we noticed issues with Guava dependencies required by Hive so we focused on #935 and #1067 which have subsequently been merged and proven to work for #933 (and within a Hive client). In the meantime we continued development of additional features for the InputFormat as well as a SerDe and a StorageHandler for Hive, all of which are temporarily at https://github.com/ExpediaGroup/hiveberg. We are now in the process of trying to merge these changes into master via #933 and #1103. Then we'd like to add more of the integration tests from Hiveberg and ideally tidy up and refactor more of the code between the two input formats. I'd have a preference for merging any improvements that you have here into #933 or subsequent follow-up PRs so hopefully we end up with the best of both worlds and a really feature-rich, well-tested InputFormat. @rdblue @rdsr what are your thoughts?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/641991343/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/642145235","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1102#issuecomment-642145235","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1102","id":642145235,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MjE0NTIzNQ==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-10T17:14:51Z","updated_at":"2020-06-10T17:14:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Merged.

Looks like a good start. I think we need to take a close look at how date/time types are handled because the Iceberg generics use Java 8 classes. I don't think that the object inspectors support those, and the inspector created for timestamp (converted to bigint `TypeInfo`) will definitely not work if it is called for a LocalDateTime or OffsetDateTime.\r\n\r\nI'd also like to exercise the object inspectors in a test to make sure a record wrapped by IcebergWritable returns the correct types when deserialized and inspected.
