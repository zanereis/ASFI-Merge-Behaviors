So pause() is only a local call. No?\r\n\r\nThis is not decided. Right now Leader, follower and application all could drive pause/install snapshot/resume process. For Leader and application, it has to be a RPC call. If it is the follower to take responsibility for catch-up, it should be a local call.\r\n\r\nI am leaning to let either leader or application (which needs client change) to handle this process. That's why I am adding this as a RPC call. \r\n\r\nAnother reason to keep it as a RPC call is, seems to me that keep the room to allow applications in the future pause a node is ok. E.g. people just pause a node and manually log in to inspect the node's status.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo do you think it is better to let follower do all the work?

Suppose the user data is stored as a local file in the client side.  The client has to read the entire file (say, 100MB) as a ByteString and then send it out using AsyncApi.send(entire_file_message).  Internally, AsyncImpl/RaftClientImpl create a RaftClientRequest containing entire_file_message.\r\n\r\nIn DataStream, the client will first create a DataStreamOutput. Then client reads and sends chunks (say, 1MB each chunk) of the file in a loop.  The client should use the zero buffer copying API in Java to read the file chunk to a direct buffer.  If it is the case, DataStream could send it out without any buffer copying.  Internally, DataStreamOutputImpl will create a RaftClientRequest and send it out as the header.  Note that we allow buffer copying for the RaftClientRequest since it only has metadata.  Therefore, we may use Protobuf to encode RaftClientRequest.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/comments/707542547/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/comments/707550144","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ratis/pull/221#issuecomment-707550144","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/221","id":707550144,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwNzU1MDE0NA==","user":{"login":"runzhiwang","id":51938049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxOTM4MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51938049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhiwang","html_url":"https://github.com/runzhiwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhiwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhiwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhiwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhiwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhiwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhiwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhiwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhiwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhiwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-13T07:30:14Z","updated_at":"2020-10-13T07:30:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Then client reads and sends chunks (say, 1MB each chunk) of the file in a loop.
