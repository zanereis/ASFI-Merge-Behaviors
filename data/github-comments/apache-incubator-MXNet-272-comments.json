2:\r\nFor another unexpected behavior, I simplify the example to be following:\r\n```python\r\ndef test2():\r\n    a = nd.ones((2, 3), ctx=ctx)  # a is 1\r\n    a.attach_grad()\r\n    d = nd.zeros((2, 3), ctx=ctx) + 100  # d is 100\r\n    d.attach_grad()\r\n    with ag.record():\r\n        b = a * 2\r\n        t = b * d\r\n        t.backward()\r\n        PP(d.grad)\r\n    with ag.record():\r\n        b = a * 2\r\n        t = b * 3\r\n        t.backward()\r\n        PP(d.grad)\r\n```\r\nBoth runs give `d.grad` equal to 2. However, in the second graph, `d` is never used so `d.grad` should be zero. I guess here `d` simply keeps the gradient value of the last computation graph. I think this behavior is still ok (and should warn user in doc or something), but should be consistent when `d.grad` is attached using `add` requirement.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/345043028/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/345070261","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/8644#issuecomment-345070261","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/8644","id":345070261,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NTA3MDI2MQ==","user":{"login":"zhreshold","id":3307514,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDc1MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3307514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold","html_url":"https://github.com/zhreshold","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-16T21:36:01Z","updated_at":"2017-11-16T21:36:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The

The concern I still have is if we disable certain tests on PR-level and only run them nightly, the problems in code may not surface in PR as they should. One might submit a patch for optimization or fix on existing op which actually contains bug, whose tests only run nightly. Reviewers might assume that the tests are run by the CI while in fact they are not. In general, removing tests from CI in PR is equivalent of removing the guarantee that the particular functionality still works after the PR.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly some tests, including some of the tests I wrote, may be simple fuzzy tests with randomized inputs, that should have been designed as small fixtures to catch specific edge cases. That way, the each of the tests won't run for longer than seconds which is ideal. I agree we should do better at writing tests. Given the current situation in the test cases, it will be major endeavor moving from where we are to where the ideal world is. Given the constraint that we shouldn't be breaking mxnet in doing so, I think we should only replace existing long-running tests with carefully designed test cases instead of disabling them.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/345336009/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/345338272","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/8689#issuecomment-345338272","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/8689","id":345338272,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NTMzODI3Mg==","user":{"login":"KellenSunderland","id":7443219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NDMyMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7443219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland","html_url":"https://github.com/KellenSunderland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-17T19:13:54Z","updated_at":"2017-11-17T19:13:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@szha For what it's worth I agree with all of your points.
