@mattyb149 @bbende @brosander \n\nAs of right now, this PR (commit `ffab01d`) is rebased against the latest master. The tool is found in `nifi-toolkit/nifi-toolkit-assembly/target/nifi-toolkit-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-bin/nifi-toolkit-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT/`. Running the command below (for example) will read an existing _nifi.properties_ file, encrypt all sensitive non-empty values using the provided _key_, populate those values (and the associated protection schemes -- `x.y.z.protected=aes/gcm/256`) into the new _nifi-encrypted.properties_ file, and persist the key in _bootstrap.conf_. \n- `$ ./bin/encrypt-config.sh -h` -- prints a usage message\n- `$ ./bin/encrypt-config.sh -b path/to/bootstrap.conf -n path/to/nifi.properties -o path/to/nifi-encrypted.properties -p thisIsABadPropertiesPassword` -- normal use as described above\n- `$ ./bin/encrypt-config.sh -b path/to/bootstrap.conf -n path/to/nifi.properties -o path/to/nifi-encrypted.properties -k 0123456789ABCDEFFEDCBA98765432100123456789ABCDEFFEDCBA9876543210` -- normal use as described above with raw hex key instead of password\n- `$ ./bin/encrypt-config.sh -b path/to/bootstrap.conf -n path/to/nifi.properties -o path/to/nifi-encrypted.properties` -- normal use as described above but will prompt for key in secure console read\n\nBy default, it considers _sensitive_ properties as anything that would be a password or key:\n- `nifi.sensitive.props.key`\n- `nifi.security.keystorePasswd`\n- `nifi.security.keyPasswd`\n- `nifi.security.truststorePasswd`\n\nYou can mark additional keys as _sensitive_ by including them in a comma or semi-colon delimited string as follows (do this by hand in the input _nifi.properties_ before running the tool):\n`nifi.sensitive.props.additional.keys=nifi.ui.banner.text`\n\nExample:\n\n_before_ --

I did just push a new commit, because I noticed some weirdness. When starting up, sometimes nodes would log that there is a cluster coordinator when there actually was not. It appears that if non-Coordinator nodes that are running an embedded zookeeper are shutdown (or an external zookeeper is shutdown), and then coordinator is shutdown, the coordinator's address is persisted in ZooKeeper. So if ZK and the cluster are restarted, the nodes would think there is a coordinator when there is not. They would then all fail to connect to the cluster because the ZNode that held the coordinator address would be deleted when ZK/Curator realized that the node is no longer connected. As a result, there would be no Cluster Coordinator and no node would register for the role because they all thought one was elected previously.\n\nThis new commit addresses this by detected the condition in StandardFlowService and then registering for the role.\n\nYou will note that a lot of files changed for this. This is because I needed to move the NoClusterCoordinatorException from nifi-framework-cluster-protocol to nifi-framework-api and the package name changed to reflect a more accurate package, so imports were changed in several files.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/242072979/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/242087723","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/925#issuecomment-242087723","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/925","id":242087723,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MjA4NzcyMw==","user":{"login":"JPercivall","id":11302527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzAyNTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11302527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall","html_url":"https://github.com/JPercivall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-24T14:38:19Z","updated_at":"2016-08-24T14:38:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hey @alopresto, when building the encrypt toolkit on Windows I get a number of test failures.

This is because in order to represent certain bytes as actual characters UTF8 has to insert extra marker bytes; then when you convert back to bytes these extra bytes come back too.  I've see the conversion of binary data -> UTF8 -> binary data grow by 40%.\n\nThe key thing to remember for this processor is that the data coming in only looks like text because it is contained in an attribute, it's not actually text, it's raw bytes. In this processor 'ascii' means that each character is represents a single byte; calling string.getBytes(\"ASCII\") is just a handy shortcut in Java to get this functionality.\n\nI can rename it to 'onecharperbyte' if that makes more sense.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/242108715/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/242113066","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/883#issuecomment-242113066","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/883","id":242113066,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MjExMzA2Ng==","user":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-24T15:45:32Z","updated_at":"2016-08-24T15:45:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"That part makes sense, but what about when I put three emoticons in the UpdateAttribute processor to set the value, then I get three bytes in the table, all value 63.

setup 2 standalone nifi instances on separate hosts and created a 3rd host to serve as proxy server using Apache Web Server.  NiFi server A was set as the push server which generated 10MB Flow Files every 10 seconds. Server A referred to server B via a RPG. Server B received input flowfiles and saved them to disk via PutFile.  The following test configurations were performed:\n\n1) Unsecured NiFi instances with no Proxy  - Data was exchanged and saved on Server B as expected\n2) Unsecured NiFi instance with Proxy (Basic/Digest Auth) - when attempting to post via Proxy on Server B endpoint nifi-api/data-transfer/input-ports, proxy logged connection attempt with Status 407 415 (authentication required, post method).  Proxy logged subsequent responses of 201 or 202 for these attempts.  For deletes, 407/415  were logged and subsequent 200 was received (OK). No exception seen in log on either server. Debug of site to site rest api confirmed interactions with Unchalleged/Challenged authstate logging. Data exchange completed successfully\n4) Secured NiFi Instances with no Proxy - After required policy updates in NiFi data was exchanged and performed as expected\n5)  Secured NiFi Instances with Proxy (Basic/Digest Auth) - Results same as test #2 however proxy logs did not detail resource endpoints accessed (I believe due to SSL enabled)\n6) Secured NiFi  instances with Proxy (No User/Pass Provided) - NiFi logged error indicating :  Unable to refresh Remote Group's peers due to response code 407:Proxy Authentication Required with explanation: null.  Error Message was expected and resolved once user/pass provided for proxy.\n\nGiven the above tests I believe that proxy authentication is working as expected with this patch\n\n+1\n\nWill merge into
