Thanks for reviewing and good advices so much.  I agree we should define how should it look like first. And I try to give my opinions  for your question.\n1. exponential backoff strategy.  \nIn fact, it is not complete exponential backoff. like 'Math.min(2 \\* timeoutMillis, maxHeartbeatTimeout)', Maybe we could use maxHeartbeatTimeout to decrease the risk of wait twice as long as defined until notified about a heartbeat failure.\nAlso we could use constant retry period instead of backoff strategy\n2. whether every heartbeat connection should be responsible for triggering itself or whether the heartbeat manager should be responsible for that?\nEvery heartbeat scheduler don't trigger itself, it depends on outer world(Here i means HeartbeatManager) call it's start method to trigger it.  \n3. Is the heartbeat receiving end an independent RpcEndpoint? How does the payload delivery works? Does the sender side asks for the result (future) or does the receiving side answers via a tell message to the heartbeat manager?\nOn the sender side, receiving end is a gateway which can be got by its address. And Sender side ask receiver for the heartbeat payload.\n4. How does receiving end monitor the sender so that if the heartbeat request is not delivered, then receiving end could mark sending end as dead?\nI think it could be independent of heartbeat manager on the sending side. It should run on the receiving end while heartbeat scheduler run on the sending side.\n\nWhat's your advice?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/242266735/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/242268633","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2416#issuecomment-242268633","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2416","id":242268633,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MjI2ODYzMw==","user":{"login":"tzulitai","id":5284370,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODQzNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5284370?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai","html_url":"https://github.com/tzulitai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-25T02:59:09Z","updated_at":"2016-08-25T03:09:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @smarthi,\nThank you for picking this up.

I'm actually not sure whether the exponential backoff strategy makes sense. The `maxHeartbeatTimeout` won't solve the underlying problem as you timeout can then be up to `2*maxHeartbeatTimeout`. I guess the best approach would be to have a periodic heartbeat interval which is adaptive wrt load. But I'm not sure here.\n2. It's correct that the `HeartbeatManager` starts the `HeartbeatScheduler`. However, from then on, the `HeartbeatScheduler` are responsible for the triggering. In order to control the heartbeat load you would need to coordinate it on the `HeartbeatManager`-level.\n3. Sure, but the question is whether the RM, TM and JM have to implement an interface for it (adding it to their RPC contract) or whether we have an independent component responsible for the heart beating. Furthermore, there is a difference if you reply to an RPC call (give the result back as a future) or whether you send yourself an RPC to the sender. The former has the problem that timed out futures will be ignored and thus all the work you've done on the receiver side has to be re-done for the next heartbeat trigger message.\n4. I'm actually not so sure whether the components are so different. Logically the receiving and sending side should have the same heartbeat timeout detection logic. The only difference should be that the sender initiates the heartbeat and the receiver answers to it. One could also think about having on each side an heartbeat sender instance. Anyway, I think that the receiving and sending side should be developed together and not considered separate parts.\n\nI think we should first concentrate on these questions to agree on a design for the heartbeat component. This should happen in the JIRA issue.\n\nFurthermore, I think you still have to clean up the PR because it contains unrelated changes. So best if you close it and then we concentrate first on the design.

Now, assuming that a 1 minute rate is regularly reported they should be able to derive whatever rate their want (as long as it is greater than 1 minute) from the time-series of the 1 minute rate.\n\nMoving these responsibilities into the metric backend simplifies things on our end. We only have to calculate a single rate (=> less overhead) and all meters would expose the same rate.\n\nWhile a configurable meter or one that exposes multiple rates _could_ work in user-code it falls flat in regards to the system metrics for which users have no way to decide which rate to calculate. Any configuration here would be done on a per-cluster basis, which means that it a) can't be changed without restarting the cluster and b) would not work in multi-user environments without calculating all rates all the time.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/242323024/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/242326400","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2400#issuecomment-242326400","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2400","id":242326400,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MjMyNjQwMA==","user":{"login":"mxm","id":837221,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNzIyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/837221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm","html_url":"https://github.com/mxm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-25T09:15:47Z","updated_at":"2016-08-25T09:15:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I

They contain fields for specific values, like the job ID, and the remaining scope not covered by these fields.\n\nMetrics, or rather their scope, name and value(s), are now serialized with a new `MetricDumpSerializer` to a byte[] using a `Data-/ByteArrayOutputStream`. \n\nOn the other end we have the `MetricDumpDeserializer` which deserializes the metrics to a `List<MetricDump>`. A `MetricDump`is a container for the metric value, it's name the `QueryScopeInfo`. There are sub-classes for each metric type, like `CounterDump`.\n\nNeither the `MetricQueryService` nor `MetricFetcher` know anything about the serialized format, just that it's a byte array.\n\nThere is no encoding for field orderings but tests that verify that the fields are assigned correctly. If a developer were to change the order of fields a test would fail, and the only way for this to make it into master would be if a) the test is simply changed to give a green light and b) it isn't noticed in the review, at which point all bets are of anyway. So i decided to keep it a bit simpler.\n\nThe `MetricStore#addMetric()` method has now become a bit smarter in regards to handling `Histograms`. With all values being contained in a `HistogramDump` we now only have to analyze the scope once.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/242381903/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/242384725","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2416#issuecomment-242384725","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2416","id":242384725,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MjM4NDcyNQ==","user":{"login":"rmetzger","id":89049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger","html_url":"https://github.com/rmetzger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-25T13:25:55Z","updated_at":"2016-08-25T13:25:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1

the sniffing feature of transport client can achieve this with the current ES2 connector in master branch.\nThe client will connect to all existing nodes and the connected list is updated every 5 seconds. It can fit our case because we will only have to specify one ip, and we will obtain a list of ips which updated periodically. It's done by\n`Settings settings = Settings.settingsBuilder().put(userConfig).put(\"client.transport.sniff\", true).build();`\n\nExplanation:\n\n> The Transport client comes with a cluster sniffing feature which allows it to dynamically add new hosts and remove old ones. When sniffing is enabled the the transport client will connect to the nodes in its internal node list, which is built via calls to addTransportAddress. After this, the client will call the internal cluster state API on those nodes to discover available data nodes. The internal node list of the client will be replaced with those data nodes only. This list is refreshed every five seconds by default.

think that works to expose the names. I was wondering, though, if we can have a more JMX-natural integration.\n\nThe JMX `ObjectName` has the constructor `ObjectName(String domain, Hashtable<String,String> table)`. Rather than having `key1=taskmanager,key2=<hostname>,key3=<jobname>`, we could go for `domain=taskmanager.task.operator.io.numRecords` (no variable parsing) and `table={taskmanager=<tid>, hostname=<hostname>, jobid=<jid>, ...`. If I got the thoughts of some of the users right, that would be the preferred way for them.\n\nThat probably contradicts the \"configurable name\" design we have for the other reporters, because the table and the formatted scope/name override each other (I think, not sure, not a JMX expert here).\n\nIn the end, both approaches are probably valid and which one is more usable depends on the metric infrastructure of the users. So, if we cannot get both into the same reporter, should we simply have two JMX reporters? A \"tag-based\" (like discussed above) and a \"name/scope-based\" (like we have so far)?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/242455212/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/242462602","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2420#issuecomment-242462602","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2420","id":242462602,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MjQ2MjYwMg==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-25T16:56:40Z","updated_at":"2016-08-25T16:56:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the fix @haoch!

However, I'm still curious whether or not it is possible / reasonable to drop the `FlinkKafkaProducer010Configuration` return type of invocation (b), and let both invocation methods return `FlinkKafkaProducer010` instead. So,\n\n```\nFlinkKafkaProducer010 kafka = new FlinkKafkaProducer010(...)\n// or FlinkKafkaProducer010 kafka = FlinkKafkaProducer010.writeToKafkaWithTimestamps(...) for timestamp support\n\n// setter config methods directly done on the FlinkKafkaProducer010 instance regardless of (a) or (b)\nkafka.setLogFailuresOnly(true)\nkafka.setFlushOnCheckpoint(true)\nkafka.setWriteTimestampToKafka(true) // would not have effect if original invocation method (a) was used\n```\n\nBut we'll need to be bit hacky in `invokeInternal(element, elementTimestamp)`, something like only letting the given `timestamp` to `ProducerRecord` be non-null if `writeTimestampToKafka && elementTimestamp != Long.MIN_VALUE`. I think it should be possible, or am I missing something?\n\nWhat do you think?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/242463997/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/242465861","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2420#issuecomment-242465861","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2420","id":242465861,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MjQ2NTg2MQ==","user":{"login":"haoch","id":1282617,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODI2MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1282617?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoch","html_url":"https://github.com/haoch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-25T17:05:53Z","updated_at":"2016-08-25T17:05:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@fhueske sure and thanks for the comment.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/242465861/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/242467053","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2244#issuecomment-242467053","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2244","id":242467053,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MjQ2NzA1Mw==","user":{"login":"mushketyk","id":592286,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MjI4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/592286?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk","html_url":"https://github.com/mushketyk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-25T17:08:54Z","updated_at":"2016-08-25T17:08:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you for helping with this PR @fhueske \nIt's ok, I'll update the PR in an hour or so.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/242467053/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/242472243","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2294#issuecomment-242472243","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2294","id":242472243,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MjQ3MjI0Mw==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-25T17:26:06Z","updated_at":"2016-08-25T17:26:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This is okay to merge from my side.

This unnecessarily delays responses to canceling and redeployment.\n- At this point, the `KeyGroupAssigner` interface seems a bit useless, especially if it is not parametrized with variable key group mappings. For the sake of making this simpler and more efficient, one could just have a static method for that.\n- I would suggest to make the assumption that key groups are always used (they should be, even if their number is equal to the parallelism), and drop the checks for `numberOfKeyGroups > 0`, for example in the KeyGroupHashPartitioner.\n- A bit more difficult is what to assume as the default number of key groups. We thought about assuming a default of `128`. That has no overhead in state backends like RocksDB and also allows initial job deployments which did not think about properly configuring this to have some freedom to scale out. If the parallelism is >= 128, this should probably round to the next highest power-of-two.\n- There are some log statements which cause log flooding, like an INFO log statement for every checkpoint stream (factory) created.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/242788179/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/242788406","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2388#issuecomment-242788406","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2388","id":242788406,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0Mjc4ODQwNg==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-26T16:48:17Z","updated_at":"2016-08-26T16:48:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks quite good all in all.\n\nBe good to get this in, so that JobManager followup work can build on this.\nI would take this, rebase it, and merge it.

We should check that security is really enabled and fail the test if not.\n\n@mxm I am not sure why the IPC layers are using auth:SIMPLE but I have verified the same log messages (NM/RM logs) on a running HDP (secure) cluster too. I would imagine this is the default implementation and we can ignore those messages. However, while investigating this issue, I have found an interesting problem with YarnMiniCluster. The containers created does not have the Yarn Configuration that we pass through the test code. The KRB5 file is also not visible and hence the UGI/security context that we create was missing proper Hadoop configurations. I have fixed the issue and patched it.\n\nI have also disabled the RollingSinkSecure IT test case since secure MiniFS cluster requires privileged ports. We can enable the test case when the patch (HDFS-9213) is made in to main stream.\n\nPlease take a look and let me know if you can deploy and run the code.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/242996492/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/242996533","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2425#issuecomment-242996533","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2425","id":242996533,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0Mjk5NjUzMw==","user":{"login":"vijikarthi","id":5560671,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NjA2NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5560671?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijikarthi","html_url":"https://github.com/vijikarthi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijikarthi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijikarthi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijikarthi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijikarthi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijikarthi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijikarthi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijikarthi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijikarthi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijikarthi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-28T20:14:21Z","updated_at":"2016-08-28T20:14:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mxm - The patch is available for your review.
