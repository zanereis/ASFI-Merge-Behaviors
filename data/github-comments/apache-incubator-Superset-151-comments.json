I think this PR only remedies part of the problem. Fundamentally the `DashboardFilter`, `SliceFilter`, and `DatasourceFilter` use the corresponding `perm` field to filter out ineligible entities. The `perm` filter is datasource (and not schema etc. specific) and thus a Gamma user can only see datasources which have been explicitly defined for the role.\r\n\r\nThis PR remedies the problem somewhat by also including datasources owned by the current user (which may not match the permission filter), but does not address the issue of other Gamma users who may be entitled to access it. I wonder if there's a solution which correctly addresses this issue, i.e., the filters correctly list the entity the current user is able to access. \r\n ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/398908654/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":1,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/398920715","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/5208#issuecomment-398920715","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/5208","id":398920715,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5ODkyMDcxNQ==","user":{"login":"graceguo-supercat","id":27990562,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3OTkwNTYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27990562?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat","html_url":"https://github.com/graceguo-supercat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-20T22:42:40Z","updated_at":"2018-06-20T22:42:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@john-bodley do you have any backend task that monitor if `img` tag has `class=loading`? i think this PR will remove `class=loading`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/398920715/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/398927431","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/5250#issuecomment-398927431","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/5250","id":398927431,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5ODkyNzQzMQ==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-20T23:19:39Z","updated_at":"2018-06-20T23:19:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I don't think Greenplum is meant to be used for OLTP workloads.

I'm making url_params a hidden control so that it will get stored in the explore controls and we don't need to change anything about the formData. \r\n\r\nOn the python side, there's a problem where we were adding slice params to the form data `slice_form_data.update(form_data)` then `form_data = slice_form_data`, which would override any params that still applied to this viz type but would persist extra params that no longer applied. There's no way to validate that params are valid for the viz type on the backend, so we should be careful when adding slice params to the form_data.\r\n\r\nIt looks like this change was added [here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/commit/83524f97d7fcf3c8c86efd25f6e5f76fda1b48f5#diff-ac978615a4f22c4fad4d01f39e1d4595R967). And in some of the tests in that PR (and in PRs since) we've added the ability to add in specific form_data overrides to explore_json. Ideally it seems the data flow should be to pull the slice info on explore, then let the front end validate the controls from the raw form data, and always send the full validated form_data to explore_json (and not add much to form_data at that point). But in some of these tests like [test_slice_url_overrides](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/master/tests/core_tests.py#L640) we pass slice_id and specific form data overrides to explore_json expecting get_form_data to pull the full slice params and override a specific param. Would we ever make a call to explore_json with form data like `{'slice_id': 51, 'groupby': ['state']}` or do we need to fix the tests to pass through full form_data?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/398929156/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/398936803","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/5214#issuecomment-398936803","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/5214","id":398936803,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5ODkzNjgwMw==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-21T00:14:56Z","updated_at":"2018-06-21T00:14:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/5214?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#5214](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/5214?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/commit/13cbf80fb33b429273fadead85471cca7aac6d78?src=pr&el=desc) will **not change** coverage.\n> The diff coverage is `100%`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/5214/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&token=KsB0fHcx6l&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/5214?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@           Coverage Diff           @@\n##           master    #5214   +/-   ##\n=======================================\n  Coverage   63.28%   63.28%           \n=======================================\n  Files         259      259           \n  Lines       19689    19689           \n  Branches     1968     1968           \n=======================================\n  Hits        12461    12461           \n  Misses       7219     7219           \n  Partials        9        9\n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/5214?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [superset/connectors/druid/models.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/5214/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-c3VwZXJzZXQvY29ubmVjdG9ycy9kcnVpZC9tb2RlbHMucHk=) | `80.56% <100%> (ø)` | :arrow_up: |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/5214?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/5214?src=pr&el=footer).

Agree that having multi does not imply you cannot do single. Power users and those that \"know\" the data would get it.  However, there are some valid use cases I see for both \"single select\" and more importantly \"default\".  For instance, Multi Currency where you may have metrics that need to be constrained or perhaps weird pre-aggregated location metrics such as (0-5 miles, 0-10, 0-15).  This would cause incorrect results with a multi select.  These may no be common but possible.  \r\n\r\nWe are able to force a Single Select variant of FilterBox.jsx and it seems to work.  This is basically editing of ComponentWillMount with a onChange as well as logic to adjust OrigSelectedValues in the render for the actual FIilterbox.  This seems to work except that it does not force the \"initial\" render.\r\n\r\nThe \"Default\" Value we are able to code also (e.g. First value from dropdown) but what we found is that this can break or affect the other slices which seems problematic.  Perhaps this would require a different approach.  Perhaps a redux related action?\r\n\r\nWill the upcoming work address Single and Default?  If so, that would be awesome.

OLTP encompasses a wide range of possibilities.  Superset isn't really doing traditional OLTP type activities, it is simply using the database as a relational database.  Some OLTP systems have heavy referential integrity while others built for speed (10k transactions/second) have only the most minimal checks.\r\n\r\nBottom line is that it really depends on use cases and where selecting a sub-optimal technical platform may improve the overall solution optimality.  The challenge with advocating a two database platform solution is complexity, cost, and people.  Since Superset's use of the database is not overly taxing, it seems like a good idea to allow it to support the widest set of databases possible to encourage adoption and remove barriers to economical use.\r\n\r\nSince Greenplum can be supported through SQLAlchemy it seems like a worthy target database in the future.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/399153882/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/399155033","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/5256#issuecomment-399155033","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/5256","id":399155033,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5OTE1NTAzMw==","user":{"login":"jeffreythewang","id":3317634,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTc2MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3317634?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreythewang","html_url":"https://github.com/jeffreythewang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreythewang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreythewang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreythewang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreythewang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreythewang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreythewang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreythewang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreythewang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffreythewang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-21T15:59:43Z","updated_at":"2018-06-21T15:59:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ah I see.
