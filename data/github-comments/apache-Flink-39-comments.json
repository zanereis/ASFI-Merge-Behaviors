Something wrong with my GMail settings, most of the messages from jira and mailing list went into Spam.\n\nKindly excuse my limited understanding of this framework and the intention/drivers behind the decisions made. \n\nGoing through the mailing list and the ticket I realized that though there may be some valid cases of missing data types, it will not be desirable to change the `TupleTypeInfo` and the whole Tuple/Case Class Serialization code-base to support null and we should identify an alternative approach to handle this.\n\nFrom my limited understanding, the recommended way of working with missing values is to use `(Option[Int], Option[Int]])` instead of `(Int, Int)`, when we know there can be missing values in the data. Is that correct?\n\nIf that is correct, I have a few doubts,\n1. Doesn't this push the handling of missing data to the application code (which may be good or bad), but makes the application code more verbose?\n2. Wouldn't the size of Option[Int] in memory (and also in serialization) be more than just Int?\n3. If Flink does not support null values except for in the Table API, won’t there be inconsistency when users try to convert a `Table` to a `DataSet[Tuple]`? \n\nOne alternative approach I can think of is introducing another TypeInfo which supports null values (say TupleTypeInfoWithNull) so users can choose to use that when they know/think that the data may contain null.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/115936916/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/115976631","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/860#issuecomment-115976631","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/860","id":115976631,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNTk3NjYzMQ==","user":{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-27T07:17:53Z","updated_at":"2015-06-27T07:17:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think we can merge this now.

We are discussing a tricky thing here...\n\nIt is true, right now, one needs to be aware of missing values in the application logic. I personally like that, an `Option` makes it very explicit and easy to grasp. Also the byte overhead for the option field is okay, as most fields will not be nullable and not carry this overhead. The serialization logic is also more CPU efficient that way.\n\nWhat is true is that there is a problem when converting from a `Table` to a `DataSet[Tuple]`. Tables with nullable fields could only be converted to data sets of class types, which would support nullable fields.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/116520207/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/116528738","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/872#issuecomment-116528738","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/872","id":116528738,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNjUyODczOA==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-29T08:45:39Z","updated_at":"2015-06-29T08:45:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I actually like this approach.

The API does not deal with distributed models at the moment. In the K-means case having the model distributed is overkill, as it is highly unlikely that you will have >1000 centroids, making the model tiny, and distributing it actually creates unnecessary overhead.\n\nWe can keep the current implementation, but in the future we should really test against a non distributed model, which can be broadcast in a DataSet[Seq[LabeledVector]] and compare performance.\n\nAlso, could you add an evaluate operation (EvaluateDataSetOperation) for Kmeans (and corresponding test)? It would be parametrized as EvaluateDataSetOperation[Kmeans, Vector, Double]\n\nEDIT: For the predict operation, you could also combine the `DataSet[LabeledVector]` in `getModel`, to return a `DataSet[List[LabeledVector]]`, by doing a `reduceGroup(elements => elements.toList())` on the model DataSet. Then you would be able to make predictions as normal.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/117053448/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/117054526","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/757#issuecomment-117054526","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/757","id":117054526,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNzA1NDUyNg==","user":{"login":"thvasilo","id":9048995,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNDg5OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9048995?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo","html_url":"https://github.com/thvasilo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-30T08:33:40Z","updated_at":"2015-06-30T08:34:10Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"OK, thanks for the explanation.

In this case, you have 3 commits, so:\ngit rebase -i HEAD~3 should do the trick\nThen leave pick for the first commit; squash for the others and let the instructions guide you (Ctrl-x; Y, etc...). Then force push. \n\nThe common practice afterwards (i.e. after you address my comments here) is to leave it as a new commit (don't squash!).

threshold.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/117574076/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/117581828","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/876#issuecomment-117581828","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/876","id":117581828,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNzU4MTgyOA==","user":{"login":"rmetzger","id":89049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger","html_url":"https://github.com/rmetzger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-01T10:15:53Z","updated_at":"2015-07-01T10:15:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've

from the JIRA:\n\nTurns out it's more complicated to have a score function that is available for chained Predictors as well.\n\nIf score is defined as a function of a Predictor subclass, such as Classifier, then it will not be available to a chained Classifier, since the chaining will produce a ChainedPredictor.\n\nIf we define score in the Predictor instead, we will need to provide an implementation for ChainedPredictor as well, since that extends Predictor.\n\n~~The only way forward then if we want to have a score function, is to follow the Operation paradigm, and have implicit score operations that get attached to concrete predictors, and define a default one for ChainedPredictor as well.~~\n\n~~I would suggest that for this PR, we skip the score function, keep the Scorer object and work with that for the time being. We can revisit the score function at a later point.~~\n\nEDIT: No longer true, see below\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/117700685/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/117722491","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/757#issuecomment-117722491","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/757","id":117722491,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNzcyMjQ5MQ==","user":{"login":"sachingoel0101","id":8874261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NzQyNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8874261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101","html_url":"https://github.com/sachingoel0101","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-01T15:49:41Z","updated_at":"2015-07-01T15:49:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@thvasilo , right now, there aren't other features in the library which need sampling.

They have less efficient serialization and flush buffers.\n- In cases where we can guarantee that records have ascending time stamps in a stream (sub) partition, every record is a watermark by itself, and there is no need to have extra watermarks.\n\nThe downside of having records rather than events is that we sometimes really want to flush the buffers with a watermark. On the other hand, buffers are flushed periodically anyways, so no big deal, probably.\n\nIf our stream records are always 2-tuples (timestamp, record) , then we could do something like shipping (timestamp, null) records as watermarks.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/117974230/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/117975627","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/879#issuecomment-117975627","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/879","id":117975627,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNzk3NTYyNw==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-02T09:28:10Z","updated_at":"2015-07-02T09:28:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"How is the `org.joda.time.Instant` serialized?
