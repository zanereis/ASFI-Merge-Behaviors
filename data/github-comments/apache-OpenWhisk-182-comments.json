If jobs.<job_id>.strategy.fail-fast is set to true, GitHub will cancel all in-progress and queued jobs in the matrix if any job in the matrix fails. This property defaults to true.\r\n\r\nThis `strategy` block is specifically used to create a [matrix strategy](https://docs.github.com/ko/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstrategy) in order to run a job multiple times with different parameters. For example, you may do something like this to run a job against multiple operating systems:\r\n\r\n```\r\nstrategy:\r\n  fail-fast: true\r\n  matrix:\r\n    os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, if say `ubuntu-latest` were to fail, _then_ windows would be cancelled. But since you are not using a matrix strategy like this, the `fail-fast` would be a no-op.\r\n\r\nI also get this warning in my IDE, although I do not know where to locate the schema it is using for

Therefore, I guess that openwhisk has some bugs. On the surface, this bug is that when the function executes for more than 1 minute, it will cut off the client and make the function execute in the background, but the real situation is that it reports an error after running for several minutes.
