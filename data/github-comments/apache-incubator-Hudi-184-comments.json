In general, its not encouraged to delete data files manually, but leave it to rollback to take care of cleaning up partially failed commits. \r\n\r\nmy guess is that, your large job failed due to OOM or some other reason. And so the next job you started, does a rollback of the partially failed data which is too huge and hence takes a lot of time. but even then, deletions should not take such a long time though. \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/997295187/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/997296841","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/3782#issuecomment-997296841","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3782","id":997296841,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM47cYrJ","user":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-18T23:00:58Z","updated_at":"2021-12-18T23:00:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ChiehFu : Did you get a chance to test out 0.10.0 for multi-writers.

And so the next job you started, does a rollback of the partially failed data which is too huge and hence takes a lot of time. but even then, deletions should not take such a long time though.`\r\nCan
