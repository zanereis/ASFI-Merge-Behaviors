This was one of the main reasons I wrote this Ive added to Usergrid some custom tracking and a few new REST end points that I wanted to be able use the PHP SDK with so using a system like PHP Guzzle removes the need to make code changes just let the SDK take care of that and just create new manifest files when need (Just like swagger in the api127 tool let the server descriptor control access and uri).\n   October 29 2014 12:34 AM, \"asfbot\"  wrote:  \n   \n       \n     Dave on dev@usergrid.incubator.apache.org (mailto:dev@usergrid.incubator.apache.org) replies:\n   Thanks Jason! \n   \n     I don't know PHP so I'm not the best person to review this pull request,\n   but I did take a look.
