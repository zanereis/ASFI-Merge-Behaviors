With this PR, there will be a difference between the CLI and the Web experience. \n\nSimilarly, `airflow backfill <dag_id> -m -s <start_date> -e <end_date>` will currently mark tasks success, but https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/1430 was also a UI-only change. I would like to see the CLI similarly extended. \n\nCLI code is in `bin/cli.py`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/217773027/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/217783570","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/1057#issuecomment-217783570","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1057","id":217783570,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNzc4MzU3MA==","user":{"login":"r39132","id":581734,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MTczNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/581734?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132","html_url":"https://github.com/r39132","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-09T06:13:30Z","updated_at":"2016-05-09T06:13:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bolkedebruin

However, would it not be possible to just store the rendered params on first call within a TI and serve this value of subsequent calls rather than delving into the tracking individual ids walking through the params dict?\n\nAlso, I'm confused why you'd say it lives in render_template rather than get_template_context. I wouldn't like to treat it as just another field in template_fields, since you would always want the template_fields to be able to make use of the rendered params.
