AccessControl的实现是角色。\r\n3. 实现类的每个全局变量是这个角色可以用用的所有功能。\r\n\r\n比如扩张nameServer的acl-plug的权限功能，只需要写一个NameServerAccessContorl类，里面的变量包含nameServer所有网络请求就可以了。\r\n![](https://oscimg.oschina.net/oscnet/fda59c2e205f7e94cebe3f4dc7ec4fe13a7.jpg)\r\n\r\n### NetaddressStrategy\r\n> NetaddressStrategy的功能是校验登陆ip地址与账户IP表达式是否匹配。AccessControl类的netaddress变量就是账户IP表达式\r\n\r\nnetaddress支持的表达式如下\r\n1. OneNetaddressStrategy处理简单的IP表达式\r\n    2. 127.0.0.1 \r\n2. MultipleNetaddressStrategy处理多个IP表达式\r\n    2. 127.0.0.{1,2,3}\r\n    2. 127.0.0.1,127.0.0.2,127.0.0.3\r\n3. 范围 RangeNetaddressStrategy处理范围IP表达\r\n    1. 127.0.0.*\r\n    2. 127.0.0.1-200\r\n    3. 127.0.1-200.*\r\n4. NullNetaddressStrategy处理所有IP表达式\r\n    1. \\* 或者没设值\r\n![](https://oscimg.oschina.net/oscnet/cabeb23f7ac8558e1725ca21a76d597ae3a.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\nBrokerAccessControlTransport\r\n> BrokerAccessControlTransport是用来把yml里面的数据序列化称java对象的接收类。没有其他功能\r\n\r\nAuthenticationInfo\r\n> 是为了解决acl-plug鉴权的特性（需要进行IP鉴权），保证AccessControl干净与耦合与扩展而设计的。\r\n\r\n```java\r\nprivate AccessControl accessControl;\r\n\r\n/*\r\n *  AccessControl中IP表达式中对应的NetaddressStrategy\r\n*/\r\nprivate NetaddressStrategy netaddressStrategy;\r\n\r\n/*remoting 是通过 code（Integer）识别调用接口的。\r\n *而accessControl字段名是字符串，需要进行一次解析与识别。把解析与识别的结果保存到authority里面。\r\n *解析与识别对象为AccessContralAnalysis\r\n*/\r\nprivate Map<Integer, Boolean> authority;\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n \r\n### AclPlugEngine类关系图\r\n> AclPlugEngine是核心体系，一套简单鉴权的权限体系与校验，登陆功能等。提供了完整的扩张功能。\r\n\r\nAuthenticationInfoManagementAclPlugEngine\r\n>  负责AuthenticationInfo的生成管理，重要细节请看下面端代码。\r\n\r\n```java\r\nAuthenticationInfo authenticationInfo = new AuthenticationInfo(accessContralAnalysis.analysis(accessControl), accessControl, netaddressStrategyFactory.getNetaddressStrategy(accessControl));\r\n```\r\n\r\nLoginInfoAclPlugEngine\r\n> 负责登陆，注销等操作\r\n\r\nPlainAclPlugEngine\r\n> 通过Palin方法获得acl-plug需要的账户信息。也可以通过网络的方法获得。只需要继承LoginInfoAclPlugEngine即可\r\n\r\nAccessContralAnalysis\r\n> 负责AccessContral解析与识别对象\r\n\r\nAuthentication\r\n> 负责鉴权\r\n\r\n![](https://oscimg.oschina.net/oscnet/16a9f944f31dd050ca9112ca535a86b1be3.jpg)\r\n\r\n### AclPlugController与AclRemotingService\r\n> 目前的需求在某种程度上可以认为AclPlugController与AclRemotingService的设计可以放到AclPlugEngine里面。但是为了管理，扩张与维护，解耦分开了。 \r\nAclPlugController负责整个acl-plug的管理，比如决定AclRemotingService与AclPlugEngine实现。不用PlainAclPlugEngine的方式，同过自定义的方法获取账户信息\r\nAclRemotingService负责对外接口请求  \r\n如果要在RocketMQ里面找到对应的设计。AclPlugController相当于broker，AclPlugEngine相当于store，AclRemotingService相当于remoting。\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/429607598/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/429607633","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/485#issuecomment-429607633","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/485","id":429607633,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyOTYwNzYzMw==","user":{"login":"githublaohu","id":8677242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NzcyNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8677242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/githublaohu","html_url":"https://github.com/githublaohu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/githublaohu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/githublaohu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/githublaohu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/githublaohu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/githublaohu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/githublaohu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/githublaohu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/githublaohu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/githublaohu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-14T08:48:55Z","updated_at":"2018-10-14T10:06:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"###
