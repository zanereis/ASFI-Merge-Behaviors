The last comment says issue is fixed in apache/couchdb-documentation#291, but a review of that issue just shows a tiny bit of documentation to reference the token as being a SHA1 of the username using the secret as key.\r\n\r\nBut the issue (that authentication always fails if you try to use this feature) is not fixed at all. Issue #1174 has also been closed with no resolution that I could see.\r\n\r\nSo is there some secret fix that I've missed? Or is this broken functionality now intended? If so should all documentation relating to proxy auth with these headers be removed so people don't try to use them thinking they should work?\r\n\r\nFinally, is the expected behaviour of proxy auth that you only need the couch username (and maybe roles?) to access Couch content without a password or hash or anything?

This was working fine in the CouchDB 1.x and is something what I'd expect to work in 2.x too, because when updating an existing document, the current document revision must be included in the document for an obvious reason (updater has to know a node in the revision tree). But now in CouchDB 2.x I receive:\r\n```erlang\r\n{\"error\":\"conflict\",\"reason\":\"Document update conflict.\"}\r\n```\r\nThis works fine if I'm not including document revision in the request for the case when I \"undelete\" the doc. So, the actual logic still works and I see all the corresponding revisions via `revs_info=true`. My question is this an expected behaviour? And if yes what were the reasons behind this?

A few questions and comments:\r\n\r\n * Regarding the 3Gb files, are those sizes for single document bodies? Are those attachments? Individual or total? Usually storing large individual documents or attachments in that range is considered an anti-pattern for CouchDB. Is there any way to break those up into smaller documents?\r\n\r\n * Is it a single replication or are there others (many) running at the same time?\r\n\r\n* Noticed that max http request size and max client body size are set to 1Gb and CouchDB's max document size is set to 4Gb.  Perhaps adjust the request size in both Nginx and CouchDb to a large value. For max request size, you'd want it greater than the sum of all the document's revisions and the total size of its attachments.\r\n\r\n* Regarding Experiment 1, with 2.1.2 release, should apply some of those max size configs, as opposed to using the defaults. In that release max request size was 64Mb so the default values won't work, especially if you have individual doc revisions + attachment sizes that exceed that.\r\n\r\n* Do you know if smaller sizes work, what are the limits that work (1Gb, 100Mb,...)?\r\n\r\n* Perhaps try replicating on a local network without SSL or Nginx as a debugging experiment...\r\n\r\n* Inspect the logs on source and target. Do you see 413 http errors, timeouts? Especially see if you can notice the part when errors start happening. A 413 error, either sent by CouchDB or Nginx, might indicate that some of the max size limits might be applied.\r\n\r\n* `use_checkpoints = true` is the default for the replicator, no need to set it explicitly.\r\n\r\n* There is also http://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/config/replicator.html#replicator/connection_timeout setting, maybe adjusting that up a bit might help.\r\n\r\n * Checkpoints are usually not that expensive, just an update of a local document on target and source. Try not to delay it too much. I would reduce that to something closer to the default.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/409474178/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/409477877","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/546#issuecomment-409477877","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/546","id":409477877,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwOTQ3Nzg3Nw==","user":{"login":"lag-linaro","id":613036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMzAzNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/613036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lag-linaro","html_url":"https://github.com/lag-linaro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lag-linaro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lag-linaro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lag-linaro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lag-linaro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lag-linaro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lag-linaro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lag-linaro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lag-linaro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lag-linaro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-01T07:28:40Z","updated_at":"2018-08-01T07:28:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@wohali

Short version is that the previous version of `merge_rev_trees` relied on equality of the old rev tree and the merged rev tree in order to know when the update is a document recreation. If body of the deleted document been compacted away then at recreation you've been getting into situation when the old rev tree and the new rev tree different in content but identical in structure.\r\n\r\nTo address that `merge_rev_trees` was essentially rewritten completely in [this commit](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/commit/39df1d5e78a3ffd855cc9c2a6aa257237d4444da). So now when you are trying to recreate with `rev` you are ending up in [this codepath](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/blob/master/src/couch/src/couch_db_updater.erl#L589), because your rev's depth bigger than 1.\r\n\r\nThis is all a bit esoteric, so I hope it makes sense to you.

Our goal is at least able to replicate 1GB of attachment.\r\n\r\n>Is it a single replication or are there others (many) running at the same time?\r\n\r\nOur server may receives multiple replication request at a time.\r\n\r\n>Noticed that max http request size and max client body size are set to 1Gb and CouchDB's max document size is set to 4Gb. Perhaps adjust the request size in both Nginx and CouchDb to a large value. For max request size, you'd want it greater than the sum of all the document's revisions and the total size of its attachments.\r\n\r\nThank you for catching this, but we also got a problem when we replicate data under 1 GB. What I say 2.7 GB here is basically a complete database consists of several record with its attachment.\r\n\r\n>Regarding Experiment 1, with 2.1.2 release, should apply some of those max size configs, as opposed to using the defaults. In that release max request size was 64Mb so the default values won't work, especially if you have individual doc revisions + attachment sizes that exceed that.\r\n\r\nThats why we led to Experiment 2, we still got a problem when we increase the max request size.\r\n\r\n>Do you know if smaller sizes work, what are the limits that work (1Gb, 100Mb,...)?\r\n\r\nFor sure we have success replicating 121 MB record with 120 MB portion in form of attachment.\r\n\r\n>Perhaps try replicating on a local network without SSL or Nginx as a debugging experiment...\r\n\r\nWe are on the way to debug this, will update the result later.\r\n\r\n>Inspect the logs on source and target. Do you see 413 http errors, timeouts? Especially see if you can notice the part when errors start happening. A 413 error, either sent by CouchDB or Nginx, might indicate that some of the max size limits might be applied.\r\n\r\nWe haven't notice the `413` error but good to know this, so I can debug further.\r\n\r\n>use_checkpoints = true is the default for the replicator, no need to set it explicitly.\r\n\r\nThanks, good to know this. We're little bit desperate with this result so we try various way hoping some of them work.\r\n\r\n> There is also http://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/config/replicator.html#replicator/connection_timeout setting, maybe adjusting that up a bit might help.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n> Checkpoints are usually not that expensive, just an update of a local document on target and source. Try not to delay it too much. I would reduce that to something closer to the default.\r\n\r\nI tried, but wonder if checkpoint is also working with attachment?\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThanks for the support. We are currently experimenting with plain no SSL setup in local and with HAProxy, and also will try some of your suggestion. Hope some of them work and then I able to share here.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/409654163/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/409692120","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/1483#issuecomment-409692120","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1483","id":409692120,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwOTY5MjEyMA==","user":{"login":"wohali","id":112292,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjI5Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112292?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali","html_url":"https://github.com/wohali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-01T19:22:58Z","updated_at":"2018-08-01T19:22:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Only

I have ran a perf test that would exaggerate this so we can measure. It is a database with 1 million docs that does a query that uses `_all_docs` but doesn't actually return a doc.
