looks like the hanging I was seeing was mostly a local issue in my Spark conf and is now fixed. \n\nI have Zeppelin and Spark built with Scala 2.11, and the tutorial notebook works well, I can also update the interpreter properties and that works well as well. Export is working, but Importing as mentioned by @chbrown just don't do anything. I will try with master and see if this is an issue specific to the scala 2.11 branch or not.\n\nBtw,  I am not sure if the CI build these days is helping or not, as it's very hard to trust that failures are related to

@onkarshedge sorry for late responce, it's your choice how to support versioning of course, but as mid-term evaluation starts soon, I think it's crucial to get answers on 2 previous questions now.\n\n> Could you also point to some document with high-level description of the approach how notebooks are stored in IPFS, what IPFS features are used and how to view them without Zeppelin, to make sure they are saved for people who are not very familiar with IPFS?\n\nand\n\n> Also, we need to know what is overall current implementation status, like what are TODOs, what is done, what is left, etc?
