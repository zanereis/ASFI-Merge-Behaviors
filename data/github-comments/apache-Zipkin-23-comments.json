If a service has over 100 legitimately unique operations, yeah perhaps this 100 const can be made tunable, but perhaps it's time to consider refactoring the service, as something is probably wrong with its abstractions, maybe a certain portion of the span name should really be in the service name.\n\nBesides these semantic considerations, however, there's a separate need to protect Zipkin storage from runaway emitters, by implementing a simple circuit-breaker.\n\n> What were the fires you were experiencing? \n\nThe fires weren't with the tracing systems, but with metrics. We use Cassandra as tsdb, and Elasticsearch for indexing metric names, e.g. to serve Graphite queries like `stats.counts.service.*.xxx.*.yyy.*.zzz.*.*`. From time to time some service would come up that emits metrics with UUID or timestamp or some other high cardinality value as part of the metric name, which explodes the writes to ES, and it's very difficult to build a pattern match that would separate good names from bad. But by capping the number of metrics per service we were able to get a handle on it and build alerts & circuit-breakers.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/159779010/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/159788278","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/868#issuecomment-159788278","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/868","id":159788278,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1OTc4ODI3OA==","user":{"login":"yurishkuro","id":3523016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MjMwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3523016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro","html_url":"https://github.com/yurishkuro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-26T02:54:04Z","updated_at":"2015-11-26T02:54:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I would prefer if the UI could simply display the time interval for which the aggregated results are shown.

This leads to\nhypothetical discussion around features which could be avoided if it ever\nactually ran our interop test. We shouldn't kite any more feature work\nbased on the assumptions baked into untested code.

not sure I follow. The table's TTL should simply expire the records after N days and drop them during compactions. But they shouldn't create tombstones any more than with any other table in zipkin schema. Where I do see tombstones being possible is if the spans are sub-millisecond, i.e. true microseconds timestamps are different, but they are reported from a millisecond-precision language like JS, thus producing non-unique PKs.\n\nIs there a way in C\\* to read tombstoned data and compare it with live keys, to understand what exactly is different between the two and what causes the PKs to be overwritten?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/162741204/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/162744279","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/872#issuecomment-162744279","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/872","id":162744279,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2Mjc0NDI3OQ==","user":{"login":"michaelsembwever","id":559444,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1OTQ0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/559444?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelsembwever","html_url":"https://github.com/michaelsembwever","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelsembwever/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelsembwever/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelsembwever/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelsembwever/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelsembwever/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelsembwever/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelsembwever/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelsembwever/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelsembwever/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-08T02:55:42Z","updated_at":"2015-12-08T02:58:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@yurishkuro  In this situation we're talking about expired cells, rather than tombstones from explicit deletes.
