Explanation for adapters is outdated. <br/>\n    Storm have javascript implemenation so it doesn't need to rely on external, and many projects seems not maintained, or redirect us to forked project.<br/>\n    b. multilang-protocol is outdated.<br/>\n    Spout subprocess can take a sleep in next() but shouldn't much because of heartbeat check.<br/>\n    Bolt subprocess should handle heartbeat tuple, and send sync to let ShellBolt know it's alive.</p>\n\n<p>    7. Storm-kafka project is in Storm project now, not storm-contrib.</p>\n\n<p>    I fixed some of markdowns which are not exposed to website.<br/>\n    I also add some opinion about removing contents related to zeromq / jzmq from JIRA.</p>\n\n<p>You can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:</p>\n\n<p>    $ git pull <a href=\"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR/storm\"

rel=\"marz\">Nathan Marz</a>, I can see the utility of both approaches. I'll ask <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=ncleung\" class=\"user-hover\" rel=\"ncleung\">Nathan Leung</a> to correct me if I'm wrong, but I think this approach is largely aimed at developers using the Java API, which is essentially a java library for manipulating the thrift structures that make up a topology.</p>\n\n<p>I think the pain point being addressed results from the standard pattern for writing a topology <b>in java</b> (i.e. write a main() method, wire topology DAG, switch for local/remote, etc.). Changes to the topology wiring require recompiling/repackaging. I think what people are after is a way to declaratively wire a topology without having to rebuild the jar. An example case might be a shop that has lots of generic spouts/bolts that get wired into different topologies, in which case it would be easier to have one jar and external configuration files that define how they get wired into a specific topology. Again, I'm specifically referring to the Java API that wraps the thrift manipulation.</p>\n\n<p>For interpreted/other languages, I agree that the way to go would be wrapper library around the thrift API. </p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612511194/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/66392691","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/338#issuecomment-66392691","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/338","id":66392691,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2MzkyNjkx","user":{"login":"Lewuathe","id":1713047,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MTMwNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1713047?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lewuathe","html_url":"https://github.com/Lewuathe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lewuathe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lewuathe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lewuathe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lewuathe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lewuathe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lewuathe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lewuathe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lewuathe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lewuathe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-10T01:54:58Z","updated_at":"2014-12-10T01:54:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@lazyval +1 to your idea.

Another benefit is that even if layout does not change, you can tweak the number of tasks / executors / workers or the grouping in your topology without having to rebuild source code.  This is useful both in a development environment (where it saves compilation time) and in a production environment (where it can reduce the need for recompilation if you need to scale a topology up).</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612511197/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/66620738","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/268#issuecomment-66620738","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/268","id":66620738,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2NjIwNzM4","user":{"login":"clockfly","id":2595532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTU1MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2595532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly","html_url":"https://github.com/clockfly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-11T13:48:16Z","updated_at":"2014-12-11T13:48:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tedxia

We have something similar to this that we use for a number of topologies in Yahoo that let us define a topology in a YAML.

This issue is simply about submitting topologies without having to do a compilation first. </p>\n\n<p>There are two aspects to that. First, it needs to be possible with Storm. This is and has been the case for a long time as I've outlined above. Although it's currently possible in Storm, it's not \"pretty\" because the Thrift API is verbose. </p>\n\n<p>The second is making a nice way of specifying those topologies. The proposals here are to specify those topologies via a YAML, JSON, or other \"configuration\" file – essentially, an external DSL. I am strongly against external DSLs in general. What inevitably will happen is people will want more \"dynamic\" control over the topology. For example, someone may want to specify some bolts inside of a loop. But since the topology is specified in a non-general purpose language, this isn't going to be possible. So to make this possible people will want general purpose language features added to the external DSL. Going down this road is riddled with completely unnecessary complexity.</p>\n\n<p>What I'm proposing instead is to ditch the idea of specifying topologies via configuration files and do it instead via an interpreted general purpose programming language (like Python).  By using an interpreted language, you can construct and submit topologies without having to do a compilation, which is the entire purpose of this issue. <b>You can use Java spouts and bolts in Python just as easily as you can within Java or from within a YAML or JSON file</b>. I guarantee you can make a library for specifying topologies that's as nice as doing so via configuration files, except you never lose the power of a general purpose programming language.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612511208/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/66713313","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/338#issuecomment-66713313","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/338","id":66713313,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2NzEzMzEz","user":{"login":"Lewuathe","id":1713047,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MTMwNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1713047?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lewuathe","html_url":"https://github.com/Lewuathe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lewuathe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lewuathe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lewuathe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lewuathe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lewuathe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lewuathe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lewuathe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lewuathe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lewuathe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-12T00:17:44Z","updated_at":"2014-12-12T00:18:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> How about requesting/contributing some new API that can check existence of topic to Kafka project?
