Our use case is that we have a kstream based topology, but there's one set of custom behaviour that I though cannot be implemented with the DSL. Maybe not relevant, but it aggregates hourly data from a minutely windowed ktable and forwards this to a topic.\n\nI was browsing through the docs and `process` seemed to fit the bill best. This is the setup (Kotlin code):\n\n``` kotlin\nmetricsMinutely.process(HourlyProcessor.Supplier(), \"metrics_minutely_windows_changelog\")\nbuilder.addSink(\n  \"METRICS-HOURLY-SINK\",\n  \"metrics_hourly_out\",\n  \"KSTREAM-PROCESSOR-0000000007\"\n)\n```\n\nOf course the increment of the processor name can change if we add a node before this. So this is pretty brittle. My thinking was that if `process` would return its name we could do something like this:\n\n``` kotlin\nval processorName = metricsMinutely.process(HourlyProcessor.Supplier(), \"metrics_minutely_windows_changelog\")\nbuilder.addSink(\n  \"METRICS-HOURLY-SINK\",\n  \"metrics_hourly_out\",\n  processorName\n)\n```\n\nI completely missed the transform function. That actually does exactly what I need here :-). Maybe we could clarify the javadoc a bit? I'd be happy to make a proposal.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/256146165/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/256154121","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2062#issuecomment-256154121","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2062","id":256154121,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NjE1NDEyMQ==","user":{"login":"mjsax","id":8959638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NTk2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8959638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax","html_url":"https://github.com/mjsax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-25T19:42:55Z","updated_at":"2016-10-25T19:43:33Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Seems `transform()` is the way to go.
