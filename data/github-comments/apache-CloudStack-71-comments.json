@ustcweizhou,\n\nOkay, I understood. Have you prepared a test to cover it? I mean, we need a test that deploys a DC, creates a redundant VPC, adds 1 tier, deploys 1 VM, destroys/stop/disconnect the host then when the router check runs we don't get a NPE.\n\nIn case writing an integration test for that is too much, perhaps would be nice to write some unit tests.\n\nDo you have a test environment? If so, could you please run the following tests against KVM?\n- requires HW\n  - component/test_vpc_redundant.py\n- doesn't require HW (but just run against KVM, it's fine)\n- component/test_vpc_offerings.py\n\nCheers,\nWilder\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/157389878/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/157392000","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1066#issuecomment-157392000","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1066","id":157392000,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NzM5MjAwMA==","user":{"login":"wilderrodrigues","id":5129209,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMjkyMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5129209?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues","html_url":"https://github.com/wilderrodrigues","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-17T14:54:12Z","updated_at":"2015-11-17T14:54:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @DaanHoogland,\n\nI run integration tests before creating the PRs and that's not manually and I do have only 1 bubble.

Not perfect, but we don't have the Cloudstack test-suite setup yet. Not sure I will have time to do that now.\n\nThe following steps were taken on a Cloudstack 4.5 router:\n1. Demonstrate default response when no password is to be issued.\n   1. Open a session on a linux VM\n   2. Use the arp table to get the IP address of the master virtual router (10.2.13.58 in my case)\n   3. Query the router for a password and save the result in pass.txt:\n      wget -t 3 -T 20 -O pass.txt --header 'DomU_Request: send_my_password' 10.2.13.58:8080\n   4. Verify that pass.txt is empty, delete pass.txt\n2. Demonstrate correct response when there is a password to be issued.\n   1. Obtain the IP address of a VM you want to issue a password for (10.2.13.22 in my case)\n   2. Set up the router to serve a password.\n      1. Open a session on the router.\n      2. Save a password for the VM with the value of “test_password”:\n         1. /opt/cloud/bin/savepassword.sh –v 10.2.13.22 –p test_password\n      3. Verify that the password has been saved:\n         cat /var/cache/cloud/passwords-10.2.13.58\n         10.2.13.22=test\n   3. Query the router:\n      1. Open a session on the linux VM\n      2. Run the same query command as above:\n         wget -t 3 -T 20 -O pass.txt --header 'DomU_Request: send_my_password' 10.2.13.58:8080\n      3. pass.txt should now contain test_password\n\nThose same steps were followed for a Cloudstack 4.3 router (we upgraded from 4.3 to 4.5). It was observed that the Cloudstack 4.3 router replied with \"saved_password\" when there was no password to be served.\n\nOnce we established the difference in behaviour we implemented the given fix, rebuilt the systemvm.iso and pushed it out to our hypervisors.\n\nThe solution was initially tested:\n1. By rebuilding a test network, repeating the steps above to verify that we got the expected behaviour.\n2. By reproducing the password reset issue on a Windows guest VM running on a network that used the Cloudstack 4.5 system VM. We then rebuilt that network and observed that the Windows VM maintained its password.\n   1. We also observed that the windows VM repeatedly queried the password server for 30 minutes.\n   2. This has been seen each time a network is rebuilt so far.\n3. We restarted the cloud service on Windows Guest VMs to see if that would cause the password to be lost. The password was maintained.\n4. We manually set the administrative password on a windows guest VM and then rebooted. The password was maintained.\n5. We triggered a password reset on a windows guest VM, a new password was assigned and adopted by the VM.\n6. We repeated steps 4 and 5 on a linux VM. The Linux VM behaved as expected.\n\nSubsequent to this, we rebuilt all of our networks with the fixed router. This rebuilt several-hundred virtual routers. There are several-hundred Windows guests. Whereas we were getting alerted by our clients regularly about password issues connected with reboots before the fix, we have not seen a repeat of the behaviour since this fixed was rolled out.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/157409534/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/157409637","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1076#issuecomment-157409637","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1076","id":157409637,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NzQwOTYzNw==","user":{"login":"remibergsma","id":1630096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzAwOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1630096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma","html_url":"https://github.com/remibergsma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-17T15:47:23Z","updated_at":"2015-11-17T15:47:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @nitin-maharana thanks for the fix!

is the package release version number, nothing to do with the thing that is packaged.\n\nIts purpose is to allow for this script to be used with an automated package builder, and thus create a unique package version with each iteration, for example using a jenkins job number instead of always being \"1\". Also, having a distinct package version makes the package directly usable in a yum repository without having to nuke the repodata because of signature mismatches for files that were rebuild using the same name (and package version).\n\nIt is also not only the file name that is changed.
