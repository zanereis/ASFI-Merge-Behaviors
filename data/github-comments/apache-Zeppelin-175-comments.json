Here’s the reason. In case of ‘per\nuser’, we can specify which user click the button, so we can restart\nspecific user’s interpreter. But, in case of ‘per note’, we cannot specify\nwhich note’s interpreter user want to restart it/them. So in this case, we\ndecide to restart all interpreters because of not specifying interpreters.\nAt that time, we considered providing same behaviours. That’s the reason\nwhy we restart all interpreters of ‘per user’, too.\n\nAnd to avoid this inconvenience, user can restart hos/her own interpreter\nin a note. When user click the restart button in a note, specific\ninterpreter will be restarted without stoping others’ ones.\n\nI’ll update docs for it.\n\nOn Tue, 13 Mar 2018 at 11:55 AM Eric Charles <notifications@github.com>\nwrote:\n\n> I have just worked on this issue and found a bug in the InterpreterSetting\n> class.
