And right, you can stick to `Newtonsoft.Json` with this change if you implement your own `IMessageSerializer`. You just have to implement especially the deserialization completely on your own as [the `GraphSONReader` still uses a type](https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/master/gremlin-dotnet/src/Gremlin.Net/Structure/IO/GraphSON/GraphSONReader.cs#L103) specific to our JSON library (`JsonElement`).

Now that you decoupled IMessageSerializer, it should be straightforward to put all things System.Text.Json into its own library (e.g. Gremlin.Net.GraphSon). Not sure how it would work otherwise since JsonElement is also all over the IGraphSonDeserializer interface + implementations. Is having a separate library a viable option? Did I miss something? I could tackle the change if needed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/748145504/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/748196014","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1369#issuecomment-748196014","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1369","id":748196014,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0ODE5NjAxNA==","user":{"login":"FlorianHockmann","id":21224336,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjI0MzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21224336?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann","html_url":"https://github.com/FlorianHockmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-18T16:41:31Z","updated_at":"2020-12-18T16:41:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I think @jorgebay's intention with TINKERPOP-1696 was to avoid any external types in a publicly facing API as it would make it much harder for users to update to a newer version of Gremlin.Net when we switch the JSON library if they have used these interfaces, e.g., because they have implemented their own serializers.\r\n\r\nThat problem is of course still there.

We might have already removed properties from the latter if it didn't break the file serialization role. Note that by default neither of those serialization formats return properties anyway (at least in Gremlin Server as of 3.4.0) as graph elements are converted to references before serialization occurs.  So, even if GraphBinary suddenly started to have property serialization it wouldn't have anything to serialize.

I'll leave you with one final thought before I close this, in general, even if we returned properties I tend to think that returning an entire vertex or edge is too close to `SELECT * FROM table` which isn't considered a good practice in the SQL world. The same sorts of problems can apply with Gremlin. I think I'd still recommend that users form their results explicitly and I think that even if we eventually choose to add properties to GraphBinary and allow them to be returned, we'd still want to allow users to do that somehow as opposed to just returning everything.

We recently had some discussion on this topic in the community (i.e. adding multiple strategies of the same type) and have done work on the `master` branch to codify the semantics such that you can only add one strategy of any particular type. I realize that hurts a use case like having multiple `SubgraphStrategy` or as you  suggest, usage of multiple `PartitionStrategy` implementations, but I don't think any strategy was designed with that use case in mind and as such is not tested or guaranteed to work in that fashion. \r\n\r\nPersonally, I think we should avoid further complicating strategies. They are already hard to write, prone to bugs that are difficult to uncover and often do more magic than they should maybe do. If we get into the business of allowing two of the same strategy to execute consecutively it feels like we're not making anything easier. \r\n\r\nThat said, I'd toyed with the idea of having a `Mergable` interface that could be added to strategies so that at least a strategy of the same type that was \"mergable\" had some explicit semantics by which they could be combined to one and then executed once on the traversal but it wasn't high enough on anyone's priority list to think through any further than that. It could be a possible idea for the future, but I haven't seen a lot of users (any users really) asking for this. In fact, the only reason it even came up earlier in our discussions was out of idle \"what if\" discussion with @vtslab on a semi-related issue he was working on. \r\n\r\nAnyway, I just thought I'd fill you in on where things are with the sort of functionality you are proposing.

I think we made a mistake with `List` initially and that allowed you to use the API in a way we didn't intend. As we went from 3.3.x to 3.4.x we allow breaking changes in behaviors so in that sense we made the change appropriate to our versioning strategies. It's interesting to know that `PartitionStrategy` actually works the way you are using it, though it is working that way more by blissful accident than intention. While we couldn't make the change you are looking for in 3.4.x it could be arranged for 3.5.0 if we could get some consensus on what would be required.  I'd be open to wider discussion on this issue on the dev list if you'd like to start a DISCUSS thread [there](https://lists.apache.org/list.html?dev@tinkerpop.apache.org).

Part of the problem is in the `JavaTranslator` which isn't recognized the signature of your `int` varargs because it checks for `Object[]` and not the primitive forms. That's worked until now. I'm not sure how we best resolve that, but I'm not sure it's best to keep hacking in \"side cases\" to `JavaTranslator`. \r\n2. I wonder if `int` is the right data type there. Looking at SQL and Cypher their approach is to use double between 0.0 and 1.0.\r\n3. I wonder about the return type which changes based on the number of percentiles - i.e. you get a number for a single percentile but a `Map` for multiple. There is some precedence for that with `select()` though.\r\n\r\nI think that items 2 and 3 probably need to be brought to the dev list for further discussion to see if anyone has any thoughts on the matter.

you for offering this change. I'd not realized that the `statusMessage` might be `null`. I'd wonder if whatever `ResponseMessage` being created there is not being constructed properly, but I'm fine with your fix. If you could address a few items though, that would be great:\r\n\r\n1. GraphSON 1 is mostly deprecated as is GraphSON 2. I'd not enter into any significant refactoring at this point around them to extract common logic. If it really bugs you I suppose you could but I'd say just fix the problem in both places (especially since it's a minor change)\r\n2. Please add a CHANGELOG entry to say something like \"Fixed `NullPointerException` in `ResponseMessage` serialization for GraphSON.\r\n3. Please take a moment to look and see if the other serializers like Gryo and GraphBinary have this same issue. I think Gryo does but GraphBinary does not from a quick look. If there are more fixes then please adjust the CHANGELOG message as necessary.\r\n4. Please target the `3.4-dev` branch rather than `master` for this change.\r\n5.

There are two approaches:\r\n\r\n1. We err on the side of caution and generally just add the license header to everything, even, html/css files for our website\r\n2. If for some reason you can't do (1) then you add an exclusion to RAT [here](https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/4aed59437b0f122cc68c875bd7eb5b55443f7ea8/pom.xml#L370-L425).\r\n\r\n> Any thoughts on this folder structure?\r\n> Do we want to include the gremlint website code here at all or should it reside elsewhere?\r\n\r\nWe keep all of our \"website\" things in `docs/site`. We then have a [script](https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/4aed59437b0f122cc68c875bd7eb5b55443f7ea8/bin/publish-home.sh) that publishes the contents of `site/home` along with generated documentation to Apache infrastructure. That is done with SVN. In that sense, I feel as though gremlint.com should find a home there so that \"website\" things sorta stay together. On that note, perhaps my thinking would be more clear if we knew how gremlin.com will exist on Apache infrastructure. As you'd said that you would be the person handling the domain transfer, perhaps you could start that process and begin a discussion with Apache about how we would host gremlint.com? All you need to do is [create a JIRA for Infra](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/INFRA/) to get that process started - here is an [example](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-18792). You should likely reference the [VOTE thread](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r1006ed56b5d92628f3378f9baef854da6fef3f83d8492b746b467ab6%40%3Cdev.tinkerpop.apache.org%3E) we had. Once you get that created, please add the Infra JIRA to TINKERPOP-2530 for reference.\r\n\r\nI think we need to know how we would publish to gremlint.com once the transfer is done. I presume it would be in the same fashion as we currently do for our home page/docs. I suppose another option would be for gremlint to live at `http://tinkerpop.apache.org/gremlint` and then redirect to that from gremlin.com. Not sure what they would prefer for something like this. In any case, the JIRA will get that conversation going.\r\n\r\n> Would something like apache/tinkerpop/gremlint/lib and apache/tinkerpop/gremlint/website be preferable?\r\n\r\nperhaps. i've envisioned gremlint as something we publish to npm so that it can get used as a library. as such, it will need to fall under the general Maven build structure. If that is the case, then the \"lib\" will have to look more like the structure in `gremlin-javascript` - you might want to take a look at that modulate to see how it is setup. I don't think we need to make a final choice on this until we hear a bit from Apache Infra. \r\n\r\n> Some files, like the README.md and package.json files have links to OyvindSabo/gremlint and OyvindSabo/gremlint.com. Also, gremlint.com still installs gremlint from github:OyvindSabo/gremlint#master. I haven't made changes to any of this for now. Would it be preferable to do that in this PR or can it be done in a follow-up PR?\r\n\r\nMy suggestion would be that you keep this initial commit, which is the \"base transfer\" and simply push additional commits to this branch on top of it as we learn more from Infra. Therefore, feel free to push additional commits to deal with the README/package.json/etc. Another little addition to make would be to introduce gremlint in our Upgrade Documentation. You can make an entry for that [here](https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/master/docs/src/upgrade/release-3.5.x.asciidoc#upgrading-for-users). In the Upgrade Docs we call out major new features and changes so that users can get a feel for what's \"new\" after we release. If you'd like to draft something there, that would be good. \r\n\r\nFinally, almost no PR is \"complete\" without a CHANGELOG [entry](https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/4aed59437b0f122cc68c875bd7eb5b55443f7ea8/CHANGELOG.asciidoc) - even though we pull in JIRAs and their descriptions on release, we sometimes do work that is outside of JIRA or work that requires more subtle description or greater summary than a JIRA title, so we always just add a entry to CHANGELOG.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/791370867/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/793101749","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1400#issuecomment-793101749","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1400","id":793101749,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc5MzEwMTc0OQ==","user":{"login":"OyvindSabo","id":25663729,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NjYzNzI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25663729?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OyvindSabo","html_url":"https://github.com/OyvindSabo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OyvindSabo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OyvindSabo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OyvindSabo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OyvindSabo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OyvindSabo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OyvindSabo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OyvindSabo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OyvindSabo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OyvindSabo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-08T21:43:48Z","updated_at":"2021-03-08T21:57:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I fixed the `apache-rat-plugin` warnings so now the tests pass.

So, there are definitely cases that aren't covered yet by it. The problem you describe in TINKERPOP-2531 is of course a case where the current retry logic isn't enough when the server is offline longer than the retry period as we then don't start another repair attempt. We originally thought about adding a scheduled repair job that checks the pool every minute or so and tries to repair it if necessary but didn't implement it yet because it would add a lot of complexity to the driver that I would like to avoid having if we don't really need it.\r\n\r\nI really like your solution to this problem as it's much simpler than a scheduled repair but it still solves the problem. It ensures that we will try again to repair the pool if a new request should be sent but the previous attempt failed and it shouldn't add unnecessary costs as we already have a mechanism to only perform one repair operation in parallel.\r\n\r\nI see only one thing missing in this PR: Could you please add a test case for the problem this is trying to solve? We already have a few [`ConnectionPoolTests`](https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/3.4-dev/gremlin-dotnet/test/Gremlin.Net.UnitTest/Driver/ConnectionPoolTests.cs) that use mocks to create the scenarios they want to test.
