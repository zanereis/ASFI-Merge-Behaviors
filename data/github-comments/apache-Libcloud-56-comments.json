Since, IIRC, we use e-tag returned on upload to verify that checksum matches and that there was no corruption on upload. Or this only affects get requests?\r\n\r\nEDIT: I had a better look and it indeed appears it only affects GET object requests so it should be fine (only the ``hash`` field will be empty in case etag header is not returned, but that's probably fine).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/1120004747/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/1120010524","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/issues/1682#issuecomment-1120010524","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/1682","id":1120010524,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAZm485CwgEc","user":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-06T21:11:09Z","updated_at":"2022-05-06T21:11:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks
