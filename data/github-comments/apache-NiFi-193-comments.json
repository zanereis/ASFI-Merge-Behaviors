First time that I've played with this PR in a while. Generally, I think things are looking good. But I do have one major-ish concern, which I think is easy to rectify.\r\n\r\nAs is, in this PR there is only a single rule - Disallow Component. I think this is reasonable. I set it to disallow GenerateFlowFile and set the Enforcement Policy to 'Enforce'. The GenerateFlowFile processor that I had, and all that I added, became invalid because the processor was not allowed. Perfect.\r\n\r\nI then changed the Enforcement Policy to 'Warn'. But now, nothing happens. There is no warning. If I am not mistaken, the intent here is to build out a more full and robust UI that will provide more insights, information, etc. from these warnings in a follow-on PR. But the concern that I have right now is that as-is, I can create the rule and set the Enforcement Policy to 'Warn' and it does nothing. And this leads to a lot of questions.\r\n\r\nI think we need to address this before merging this PR. I think we could use either of two approaches: 1) Hide the 'Flow Analysis Rules' tab until we have the full feature built into the UI. Or 2) Remove 'Warn' from the available \"Enforcement Policy\" drop-down, leaving only \"Enforce\" (or potentially even removing the drop-down for now and hard-coding to \"Enforce\").","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1658632218/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1658910570","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/7191#issuecomment-1658910570","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/7191","id":1658910570,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5i4Pdq","user":{"login":"sardell","id":7304869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMDQ4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7304869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell","html_url":"https://github.com/sardell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-31T18:13:49Z","updated_at":"2023-07-31T18:13:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> I think we need to address this before merging this PR.

I can definitely see the value in using `WebClientServiceProvider` - that would remove a number of config properties from InvokeHTTPRecord, as well as making the code easier to test.\r\n\r\nHaving the retry handling and record splitting all inside the one processor does feel a bit like it's going against Nifi's default philosophy (break tasks up into multiple simple processors). My first instinct when building a flow was to split up the input records into individual FlowFiles and then handle HTTP requests individually. Synchronising and reassembling everything at the end got pretty painful, though, especially handling retries.\r\n\r\nThe current InvokeHTTPRecord approach was largely copied from processors like LookupRecord (i.e. do the same operation for each record in the FlowFile). I could remove the record splitting logic from InvokeHTTPRecord and let splitting be handled later by a separate SplitRecord processor, if that'd be cleaner.\r\n\r\nI can write up an outline of how I see the processor working on the Jira issue, if that's the best way to move forward.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1659551032/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1660373593","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/7532#issuecomment-1660373593","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/7532","id":1660373593,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5i90pZ","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-01T13:48:28Z","updated_at":"2023-08-01T13:48:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the reply @pspiller!\r\n\r\nOne other thing to note about HTTP communication in relation to this Processor, often REST services will have separate endpoints for batch processing. This is much more efficient in terms of network communication and transaction handling, but of course it depends on the service in question.\r\n\r\nAnother point to consider is that while InvokeHTTP supports all of the standard HTTP verbs, a record-oriented Processor only seems to make sense in the context of sending a request body, such as with POST, PUT, or PATCH.\r\n\r\nGiven these points, I think it would be best to close the current PR and scope out the options on the Jira issue.\r\n\r\nWith the goal being a generic reusable Processor, it would also be very helpful to highlight some well-known REST services where this proposed Processor would make sense. That would help highlight whether it is a good fit for something generic, or whether it ends up being too complicated for general use.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1660373593/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1660449862","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/7545#issuecomment-1660449862","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/7545","id":1660449862,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5i-HRG","user":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-01T14:31:22Z","updated_at":"2023-08-01T14:31:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I agree with the change and the request for a unit test to illustrate this.

Now, the JDBC driver limits HTTP retries to seven, by default. Customers can set the maxHttpRetries session parameter to customize the maximum number of retries. Customers can set maxHttpRetries=0 to remove the retry limit, but doing so runs the risk of the JDBC driver infinitely retrying failed HTTP calls.\r\n \r\n**New Features and Updates**\r\n\r\n- Added the CLIENT_OUT_OF_BAND_TELEMETRY_ENABLED session property to allow you to disable OOB telemetry.\r\n- Improved handling for locatorsUpdateCopy() function calls. Now, the driver returns FALSE instead of throwing an exception.\r\n- Updated handling for 400 Bad Request errors for S3 clients and added the putGetMaxRetries connection property to configure the maximum number of retries for PUT/GET exceptions for storage clients (default: 7).\r\n- Added support for httpMaxRetries in DefaultResultStreamProvider.getResultChunk()to improve chunk downloading performance.\r\n\r\n**Bug Fixes**\r\n\r\n- Fixed an issue where the driver incorrectly through null pointer exceptions (NPEs) when calling driver.getPropertyInfo().\r\n- Fixed an issue where reader.LoadNextBatch() would occasionally throw a ClosedByInterruptException when reading from the arrow stream.\r\n- Fixed an issue where the JDBC driver used the wrong proxy settings for S3 clients.\r\n- Fixed an issue where the downloadStream() function disallowed filenames containing Japanese characters.\r\n- Fix an issue where '~' was not allowed in PUT/GET file paths.\r\n- Fixed an issue where the driver would through an InvalidPathException when a Windows file path included the file:// prefix for logging configuration files.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1664204483/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1664212084","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/7559#issuecomment-1664212084","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/7559","id":1664212084,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5jMdx0","user":{"login":"pvillard31","id":11541012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTQxMDEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11541012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31","html_url":"https://github.com/pvillard31","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-03T15:37:36Z","updated_at":"2023-08-03T15:37:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Merged to 1.x.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1664212084/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1664416417","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/7571#issuecomment-1664416417","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/7571","id":1664416417,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5jNPqh","user":{"login":"mr1716","id":9115680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMTU2ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9115680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr1716","html_url":"https://github.com/mr1716","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr1716/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr1716/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr1716/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr1716/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr1716/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr1716/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr1716/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr1716/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr1716/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-03T18:08:57Z","updated_at":"2023-08-03T18:08:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@exceptionfactory Ok, thanks.

Either way, however, the Expression Language support changes in this PR are not related support for Parameters, so it seems best to close this PR and take a closer look at the recent UI changes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1668861470/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1669034162","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/7574#issuecomment-1669034162","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/7574","id":1669034162,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5je3Cy","user":{"login":"ChrisSamo632","id":12159006,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTU5MDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12159006?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632","html_url":"https://github.com/ChrisSamo632","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-08T07:11:09Z","updated_at":"2023-08-08T07:11:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM +1, merging","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1669034162/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1670358882","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/7532#issuecomment-1670358882","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/7532","id":1670358882,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5jj6di","user":{"login":"ChrisSamo632","id":12159006,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTU5MDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12159006?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632","html_url":"https://github.com/ChrisSamo632","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-08T21:54:11Z","updated_at":"2023-08-08T21:54:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"One could consider the PutElasticsearchRecord processor as a service/application-specific instance of this - operations are executed per-Record based upon processor properties and/or fields set within Records\r\n\r\nFor example, the Index Operation (index, update,  delete) can be set based upon a Record field.
