I have worked with Dubbo, Docker and k8s, and maybe I can give you some suggestion.\r\nAs far as I know, Docker is just a container engine, with very simple network ability. If you just use Docker itself, the only way to implement interaction between multiple container on different machines, is to use the Host network mode. The container will share the Host's IP and Port. Dubbo will register the IP of Host to the registry(e.g. zookeeper). \r\nThe above solution has a problem, the container share the Host's IP and port, so every container must have different ports, which lead to extra configuration work. Meanwhile, it is hard to implement auto scaling.\r\nDocker is not designed to resolve these problems, and here comes the container Orchestration tools, for example, Docker swarm, Google Kubernetes(k8s).\r\nIn k8s, we can use some network component to setup a virtual network:\r\n* each container has an unique IP, which is called Pod IP\r\n* any two container can communicate with each other directly, even they are in different hosts.\r\nI use Flannel to implement above network.\r\nSo if you deploy a containerized dubbo application to k8s cluster, the app will register the Pod IP to Zookeeper. When a new container is deployed to k8s, k8s will assign a Pod IP to it, and ensure the Pod IP is unique, and it can reach to all the other containers directly in the k8s cluster. So when you want to scale up, you just need to deploy new container to k8s. In fact, just one command in k8s. \r\n\r\nSo in k8s cluster:\r\n* service registration and discovery is implemented by Dubbo(zookeeper) itself.\r\n* the network communication is implemented by k8s(flanneld).\r\n\r\n\r\nYou also mentioned the DNS, k8s also have a DNS plugin, out of box. The DNS is used to map a k8s service name to a k8s service IP, also known as Cluster IP. The Service is in fact a load balancer in the front of several container replicas. So you can use a readable service name, for example, zookeeper to visit the zookeeper cluster, instead of the Service IP.\r\n If you are interested in these, you can find more details by your self. Or you can have a look at my wiki:\r\nhttps://github.com/vangoleo/wiki/tree/master/k8s   \r\n\r\nHope this may help you.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/375553630/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/375556826","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/1504#issuecomment-375556826","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1504","id":375556826,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NTU1NjgyNg==","user":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-23T06:22:21Z","updated_at":"2018-03-23T06:22:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Instead

When the server fails to provide services normally, the consumption terminal will automatically drop the abnormal service address.\r\n\r\n      For example, the HelloService service has three server servers, A, server B, and server C.\r\nThe consumer side access the HelloService.sayHi () method, each consumer will record the address, service name, and method name of the specific access service.\r\nIn the first step, when the server A HelloService.sayHi () method is abnormal and reaches the threshold, the consumption end's fusing mechanism removes the access address of the server A.\r\nThe subsequent access can only be the server - side B, the server - side C. At this point, the state of the CircuitBreaker is open;\r\nThe second step is the window period, which is configured freely, such as configuring 5000ms, that is, when the server A is removed for 5 seconds, the A access address of the server is re placed into the address list.\r\nAt this time, the state is half-open, which is used to try to access the service side A. The 6 consecutive visits indicate that the service A of the server is recovered, and the state changes to closed at this time.\r\nIf you try to access the server - side A failure, then the half-open state changes to open, retries it, and waits after 5 seconds to retry.\r\n2, after the CircuitBreaker, it reduces the access pressure to the exception service machine and makes the client no longer access the exception machine to improve the probability of successful return.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfigurable parameters:\r\n circuitBreakerRequestVolumeThreshold=20 //与circuitBreakerRollingStatisticalWindowBuckets配合使用，默认15秒内的访问量是10，才有可能开启熔断\r\n circuitBreakerSleepWindowInMilliseconds=60000//60秒之后重试，单位是ms\r\n circuitBreakerErrorThresholdPercentage=80//错误率80% \r\n circuitBreakerOpenweight=1 //熔断打开之后重试关闭时的权重 \r\n circuitBreakerCloseweight=1000 //存在熔断服务且过了熔断窗口可重试时没有被熔断的服务。\r\n circuitBreakerRollingStatisticalWindowBuckets //环境变量中配置\t\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/376033573/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/376035082","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/1505#issuecomment-376035082","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1505","id":376035082,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NjAzNTA4Mg==","user":{"login":"wanhuhou","id":35321350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MzIxMzUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35321350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanhuhou","html_url":"https://github.com/wanhuhou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanhuhou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanhuhou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanhuhou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanhuhou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanhuhou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanhuhou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanhuhou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanhuhou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanhuhou/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-26T03:16:13Z","updated_at":"2018-03-26T03:16:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hystrix circuit breakers by test, open and close the influence on the performance of the machine is relatively small in high performance environment (local development machine 16g delay less than 1ms), is mainly the influence of time delay, if the machine configuration is relatively low, for example: 2 nuclear 4G (about 2ms), the performance difference\r\nIt's more obvious.
