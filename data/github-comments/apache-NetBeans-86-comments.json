I've been waiting and requesting status for quite some time, but without much luck.  This led me to believe there is either no interest to pursure it further, no one (at Oracle) familiar or actively working it [i.e. Geertjan was spearheading a lot of the past netbean donation effor and is no longer with Oracle, it takes time and money to do necessary activities, etc.], or it just takes a long time to do (even though other dontations seemed to go a lot quicker).  \r\n\r\nThe thread has input from nb python team (who signed OCAs and/or worked for Oracle at the time) so it seemed like much of the concern about approval from original developed seemed resolved with the final aspect of Oracle donating the code being the last part.  However there was no apparent movement on this front.  \r\n\r\nIt was suggested in the thread using the netbeans-tools (I did make a fix to the tool in the process) could be used to update the headers to applicable Apache headers to help on code header update aspects.  \r\n\r\nIt still seems strange that the hg repository was available with the code so not sure why it was accessible here compare to a \"donated version\" but then again IANAL and I'm sure there are aspects I'm not aware of to consider.  \r\n\r\nGiven Python is one of the major languages in use in the field now, not having it available in Netbeans is a big hole that I feel needs to be filled which is why I'm pushing this so much.\r\n\r\nIn the end, to overcome a lot of the above \"Conflicting files\" I've started another nbpython_integration3 branch for a little cleaner version so this draft PR will likely go away and moved to a new one, but once again, will not raise a PR until such time as it is acceptance.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/864574205/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/864631580","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2963#issuecomment-864631580","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/2963","id":864631580,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2NDYzMTU4MA==","user":{"login":"pepness","id":9832133,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MzIxMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9832133?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepness","html_url":"https://github.com/pepness","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepness/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepness/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepness/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepness/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepness/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepness/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepness/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepness/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepness/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-20T23:58:29Z","updated_at":"2021-06-20T23:58:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Travis failed because of timeouts but I think is ready to be merged.
