The encoder only ever uses lower-case hex letters and there is no way for it to know that the value was originally written in upper-case. Maybe a configuration option, as suggested in the old bug report is the way to go but I haven't looked at that option (yet).\r\n\r\nHi, an option is okay. Or IDE can determine uppercase / lowercase encoding style by loading first encoded character and preserve this style for that opened property file (similarly as text editors detect line indentation spaces vs tabs and preserve the setting).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1410216088/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1410221060","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/5244#issuecomment-1410221060","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5244","id":1410221060,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5UDkQE","user":{"login":"neilcsmith-net","id":3975960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3975960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net","html_url":"https://github.com/neilcsmith-net","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-31T11:55:34Z","updated_at":"2023-01-31T11:55:34Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"OK, yes, without braces it doesn't work.

You create a palette of background colours that works with black-ish text, and one that works with white-ish text. Working on something similar with the visual library myself at the moment.\r\n\r\nIf the background would be theme aware - the foreground must be theme aware too, I agree.\r\n\r\nBut in this particular case the background fill colors (red/orange) already work with dark/light themes, additionally to that the boxes have an outline which is controlled by the theme - which makes it extra resistant to clash with theme colors. So the main problem here was that some boxes set the background fill without setting the font color. That is the reason I said I do not think the logic has to be aware of the theme at all - it only has to follow the rule to not pick the foreground from a theme color while hard coding the background. \r\n\r\nThe visual for \"Scopes\" will need more work since it used to be a gradient but this is outside the scope of this PR :) (I don't think it will look good in any color the way it is currently rendered as simple box in a box)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1410750212/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1410777826","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/5398#issuecomment-1410777826","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5398","id":1410777826,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5UFsLi","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-31T17:23:10Z","updated_at":"2023-01-31T17:23:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This needs to be grouped with #5397 please join this change with that commit and force push there.

With class level constants this needs to be better.\r\n\r\nFor the performance: @mbien pointed to the memory impact. A compiled pattern is held in memory, raising GC pressure as statics are not collected. Yes you will argue, that it is tiny and so I will argue, that most probably my CPU won't get a millikelvin warmer just because it has to recompile a `Pattern`. As @mbien already pointed out, this changes if you find situation where a something like this is done (this is a tight loop):\r\n\r\n```java\r\nfor(int i = 0; i < LARGE_NUMER; i++) {\r\n   Pattern p = Pattern.compile(\"CONSTANTSTRING\"),\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor this `p` can be pulled out of the loop without affecting readability, while improving performance. These cases are rare.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1416481734/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1416541530","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/5414#issuecomment-1416541530","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5414","id":1416541530,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5UbrVa","user":{"login":"mbien","id":114367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien","html_url":"https://github.com/mbien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-03T23:58:21Z","updated_at":"2023-02-03T23:58:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"this is just noise.

have a similar issue.\r\n\r\nI am building and coding against this: https://gitlab.com/ubos a bit more about it here: https://ubos.net/docs/developers/faq/netbeans/\r\n\r\nIt builds in an nspawnd container on the host using a gradle build process wrapped by python scripts. My home directory maven repo is exported to the container to which artifacts built in the container, are written. \r\n\r\nThe nspawnd container is on a bridged subnet on my arch-linux host. The container file system is shared r/w with my host. I open the sources and projects in NetBeans on the host. NetBeans does not resolve the imports and shows the cleanly-built code as not being compiled - it is, These issues are not as bad in NB 13. I run the compiled code in the container with the java debug options to expose its debugging port as 8888.

If another change is added on top of the last one, it seems difficult to know that all the empty/singleton changes are removed. \r\n\r\nIf the last change is removed, then the relatively small cleanup change could be added.\r\n\r\nSide question.

There seems to be at least two method to evolving PRs.\r\n> \r\n>     1. Multiple commits with squash when merged\r\n\r\nwe don't let gh squash third party PRs since gh does sometimes weird things with author information which depends on how the account is set up. PRs like this one here are merged as is - so the final commits are important and they are also checked via the paperwork job.\r\n\r\n\r\n> \r\n>     2. Use force and keep it a single commit\r\n\r\nthere is no rule. Not all PRs will be a single commit after merge. Some are better to be merged as multiple commits. Esp if the author does a bugfix + refactoring. Those have to be kept separate.\r\n\r\nwhatever makes it easier, there is no rule as long individual commits are buildable and green - otherwise this will cause trouble on git bisect.\r\n\r\nThis PR here was basically ready and only needed the fix for copyOf. I don't understand what is going on now tbh but I have no time to review it anyway atm. This will need a full review again.\r\n\r\n(force pushes can be reviewed via the delta on github, so it is usually no problem as long the delta is small)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1416879538/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
