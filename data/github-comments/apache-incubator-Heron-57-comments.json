When spouts and bolts are created they merge topology configs and component configs.\r\n\r\nsay if topology config has {\r\nk1: 1\r\nk2: 2\r\nke: 3\r\n}\r\nand bolt config has {\r\nk1: 10\r\nk4: 40\r\n}\r\nThe final config for the bolt would be {\r\nk1: 10\r\nk2: 2\r\nke: 3\r\nk4: 40\r\n}\r\n\r\nThis looks right as long as all they key/value pairs are expected.\r\n\r\nI missed on case in the doStormTranslation in my previous PR.\r\n\r\nMost part in the function are like this and they are safe:\r\nif (config.contains(storm_key)) {\r\n  config.put(heron_key, value)\r\n}\r\n\r\nHowever in the function, one config is different from others: TOPOLOGY_ACKER_EXECUTORS\r\n\r\nThe code is like:\r\nif (config.contains(storm.TOPOLOGY_ACKER_EXECUTORS)) {\r\n  config.put(heron.

TopologyReliabilityMode key with value1. This is ok.\r\n- when the bolt config DOESN'T have \"TOPOLOGY_ACKER_EXECUTORS\" key, the output config would still have a heron.TOPOLOGY_ACKER_EXECUTORS key, with value2. And when the config is merged with topology config, the heron. TopologyReliabilityMode will overwrite the topology config and this is bad.\r\n\r\nThis PR moves the \"if ... else ...\" block out of the shared translation function to a topology only translation function, so that the config merging is safe.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/344515322/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/344517558","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/2555#issuecomment-344517558","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/2555","id":344517558,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NDUxNzU1OA==","user":{"login":"huijunw","id":23125934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTI1OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23125934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huijunw","html_url":"https://github.com/huijunw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huijunw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huijunw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huijunw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huijunw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huijunw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huijunw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huijunw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huijunw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huijunw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-15T08:15:39Z","updated_at":"2017-11-15T08:15:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@maosongfu

This has led to unexpected behavior for users who increase the parallelism for a given component to (via changing settings and redeploying) and end up getting fewer resources per component instance. This resulted in hard-to-diagnose issues. The `ResourceCompliantRRPacking` classes were written to always give the resources the user expects/requests and to adjust the number of containers as needed. This approach seemed more ideal so the plan was to deprecate `RRPacking`.\r\n\r\nThe second reason is because conceptually there is a disconnect when implementing scaling of an algorithm that ignores requested resources in favor of a number of containers setting. When scaling, the algorithm has to dynamically figure our how many containers should be added/removed to a topology that previously had a fixed number of them. This implies a shift from container-based to resource-based sizing which is not easy to rationalize and is hence prone to misunderstanding or troubleshooting challenges. Or it means we just add/remove containers and the numContainers setting that was the source of truth during deploy becomes not so.\r\n\r\nI would recommend continuing with the plan to deprecate this class in favor of the resource-based ones.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/349389472/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/349406352","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/2601#issuecomment-349406352","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/2601","id":349406352,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0OTQwNjM1Mg==","user":{"login":"jerrypeng","id":3613359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTMzNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3613359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng","html_url":"https://github.com/jerrypeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-05T19:01:35Z","updated_at":"2017-12-05T19:01:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@nwangtw thanks for the additional review!

Have you considered other algorithms for deciding where to place new instances, or how to remove them that are less disruptive?\r\n\r\nIf you look at the other IRepacking algos there is a scoring framework utilized which allows the ability to decide if you want to scale for least disruption vs trying to remove containers vs homogeneity, etc. That could be leveraged here for consistency with the other IRepackings.
