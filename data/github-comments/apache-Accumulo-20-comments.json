The prototype can be found in commit keith-turner@5044241ca445a0bbc48e38931f09f77d8acb44b9  which is in the branch [keith-turner/ACCUMULO-4615](https://github.com/keith-turner/accumulo/tree/ACCUMULO-4615).  I am not proposing we do this, just posting it for consideration.  The concept needs to be tested on a busy cluster.\r\n\r\nI say this idea is half baked because I have never used the thrift send and recv method separately.  I suspect it may work well, but I am not sure.  I think in the case where a tablet server is using THsHaServer it may work really well because there is a dedicated thread to accept connections (even if all threads in the servers thread pool for processing connections are busy).  However in the case where the tserver uses the TThreadPoolServer (this is used when Kerberos is used and it can also be configured) there is no dedicated thread to accept connections, so the send call from the master may block if all server threads are busy (I am not sure).  A dedicated thrift server and port for getting status in tablet servers would solve this issue.\r\n\r\nA completely different way of solving this issue may be to use the thrift async client which uses non-blocking sockets for connections.  However I Am not sure how well this would work with SSL and Kerberos and I have never used the thrift async client.  I am interested in learning more about it though, but have not yet found the time to do so.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/379835988/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/379885909","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/402#issuecomment-379885909","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/402","id":379885909,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3OTg4NTkwOQ==","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-09T20:36:36Z","updated_at":"2018-04-09T20:36:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Resolved conflicts in PR with updated 1.8 branch.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/379885909/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/379886655","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/417#issuecomment-379886655","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/417","id":379886655,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3OTg4NjY1NQ==","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-09T20:39:13Z","updated_at":"2018-04-09T20:39:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@PircDef Maybe... that would be a bigger change, and more testing to ensure correctness.

It happens when a tablet is unloaded from a tserver and then later comes back. When it comes back, if data is written and no minor compaction occurs before the tserver dies then that data may not be seen.  Below is a detailed example, the seq# below are WAL seq#.\r\n\r\n * TabletA is loaded on tserver5\r\n * Define tablet is written to WAL1 with seq#1\r\n * TabletA is loaded on tserver5 for a bit and many compactions occur\r\n * Data is written to WAL1 for tabletA with seq# 50\r\n * TabletA is compacted\r\n   * compaction start is written to WAL with seq# 51\r\n   * compaction finish is writtent to WAL with seq# 52\r\n * TabletA is unloaded from tserver5\r\n * tserver5 starts using WAL2, however WAL1 is still referenced by other tablets\r\n * TabletA is loaded from tserver5\r\n * Define tablet is written to WAL2 with seq#1\r\n * Data is written to WAL2 for TabletA with seq# 1 (the seq# is lower because it resets when tablet is reassigned)\r\n * tserver5 dies\r\n\r\nDuring recovery of TabletA WAL1 and WAL2 are examined to find the last compaction to finish and its seq#.  The last compaction to finish has a seq# of 52, therefore we look for data >= 52.  However the data in WAL2 has a lower seq# and is therefore ignored.\r\n\r\nBefore 1.8.0 WAL1 would never have been included in the recovery and this problem would not have occurred.  However the changes made in 1.8.0 (moved from tracking WAL refs per tablet to per tablet server) bring WAL1 into the recovery process.  \r\n\r\nNotes from tracking down bug : [accumulo-449.txt](https://github.com/apache/accumulo/files/1956811/accumulo-449.txt)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/385106223/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/385184281","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/451#issuecomment-385184281","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/451","id":385184281,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NTE4NDI4MQ==","user":{"login":"mikewalch","id":730698,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMDY5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/730698?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch","html_url":"https://github.com/mikewalch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-28T15:30:15Z","updated_at":"2018-04-28T15:30:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"See https://github.com/apache/accumulo-website/pull/80 for updates to documentation","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/385184281/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/385455966","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/437#issuecomment-385455966","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/437","id":385455966,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NTQ1NTk2Ng==","user":{"login":"milleruntime","id":11872539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODcyNTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11872539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime","html_url":"https://github.com/milleruntime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-30T16:41:20Z","updated_at":"2018-04-30T16:41:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The more I thought about it, the less I like changing the default behavior of API.
