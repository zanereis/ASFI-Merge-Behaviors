for taking a look, Matei.  If we use system properties instead of env variables, the remaining reason we'd want to start a second JVM is to be able to have a --driver-memory property.  The only way around this I can think of would be to require users to set this with an environment variable instead of a command line option.  One small weird thing about this is that the client would still be given the max heap specified in driver SPARK_DRIVER_MEMORY even when the driver is being run on the

I'm not sure how hard it is to parse these arguments in bash -- it shouldn't be _that_ hard, but we'll also have to do it in .cmd scripts on Windows and such. Otherwise It would be good to test how slow this is with two JVM launches (maybe we can avoid a lot of the slowness).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/36945861/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/36946054","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/79#issuecomment-36946054","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/79","id":36946054,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2OTQ2MDU0","user":{"login":"mateiz","id":228859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODg1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz","html_url":"https://github.com/mateiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-03-06T22:32:49Z","updated_at":"2014-03-06T22:32:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Jenkins,

@tgravescs good catch on this one.\n\nIn terms of abstracting. The most abstract we could do would be to add a method to a `Partition` called `getPipeEnvVars` or something. That seems maybe a bit heavyweight since this is just, for now, a single case. An intermediate thing would be to add `getPipeEnvVars` only to `HadoopPartition` and move the logic about input split checking to HadoopPartition. That seems slightly nicer to me and it would leave the door open to bumping that method into the `Partition` class. What do you think about that? This is just an idea not really a strong preference.\n\nSmall comment about the tests.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/36946598/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/36946645","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/79#issuecomment-36946645","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/79","id":36946645,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2OTQ2NjQ1","user":{"login":"mateiz","id":228859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODg1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz","html_url":"https://github.com/mateiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-03-06T22:38:50Z","updated_at":"2014-03-06T22:38:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"That is Jenkins complaining about the style BTW, hopefully should be easy to fix.
