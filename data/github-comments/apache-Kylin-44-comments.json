Step `Build Hive Global Dict With Spark` has actually made an error, but it still shows success. It should be that the exception is not thrown after being catch.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31064237/147636630-23e7c122-6eef-42c2-a0ba-fc56bda2bd15.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31064237/147636673-a9d754a9-71af-4921-986a-515cc5aa254b.png)\r\n\r\n2. After building more than one segment, the total count of the fact table will become more than the actual number. Actually, `kylin_sales` has only 10000 pieces of data.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31064237/147636477-2a03c95e-04de-4c30-b18a-41a804dca223.png)\r\n\r\n3.
