I would remove the \"(non-Javadoc)\" (text) and instead format those to start with prefix /** like true javadoc and remove extra empty lines in the javadoc\r\n\r\n2. All in all check for formatting and extra lines etc.\r\n\r\n3. In case entries.offer fails, entryMap.remove is called before pageStore.storePage. If we assume pageStore.storePage is slow, maybe it would be good idea to postpone remove so that a new requiest during pageStore.storePage can use the in-memory reference? Similar to what is happening in PageSavingRunnable.run? Also this will make a great re-usable method:\r\nstorePageAndRemoveFromMap(...) {\r\n         log.debug(\"Saving asynchronously: {}...\", entry);\r\n        pageStore.storePage(sessionId, page);\r\n        entryMap.remove(getKey(entry));\r\n}\r\n\r\n4. Same as in (3.) to catch (InterruptedException e) { log.error(e.getMessage(), e);; storePageAndRemoveFromMap(...); }\r\n\r\n5. Please junit-test if any conflict occur if unbind(sessionId) is called while there are entries in the queue for that session.\r\n\r\n6. Please add tests also for borderline racing cases such as same instance is returned for new request arriving before storing is complete.\r\n\r\n7. I would rename AsyncPageStore -> AsynchronousPageStore for clarity and symmetry (symmetric naming with AsynchronousDataStore),\r\n\r\n8. Please propose a patch also into DefaultPageManagerProvider such that  new AsyncPageStore(super.newPageStore(dataStore), 100); would be the default pagestore for wicket when dataStore.canBeAsynchronous()==true.

page);\r\nentryMap.remove(getKey(entry));\r\n}\"\r\n\r\nentryMap is not supposed to be used as \"backup mem\", there's already one queue for that (entries). it's not by mistake that map-removal is located before synchronous store call for the same thread (not the worker). the reason is simple: if before try-to-queue a page fails, or it simply takes to long (offer), then that would mean app mem / process is in trouble, \"no space / speed for that\", so there's not point on keeping that ref attached to map (occupying) while synchronous storing (\"slow\" storing, as you say) if it has already been stated a fail on trying to manage it in queue (mem). using map as \"a backup for when queuing fails\" would just false the mechanism, imposing a mem kept at a non-optimal point for that. \r\non the other hand, regarding the worker thread that \"asynchronously\" stores the page, the case is the opposite. every single page that has achieved to enter the queue before (that is, offer succeeded), has already got the privilege to being kept in mem while not being entirely stored, so being removed from map after that.\r\nqueue protects itself from accepting or not new entries depending on env conditions, but outside it logic should act in coherence to it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/287029107/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/287890896","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/wicket/pull/216#issuecomment-287890896","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/216","id":287890896,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4Nzg5MDg5Ng==","user":{"login":"martin-g","id":232002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjAwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/232002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g","html_url":"https://github.com/martin-g","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-20T20:41:03Z","updated_at":"2017-03-20T20:41:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@paulspeijers
