Thank you for coming back to this issue.\r\n\r\nI had a quick chat offline with @aljoscha about whether or not it'll be reasonable to add this. Either your approach in this PR or letting window operators checkpoint watermarks will both solve the issue of late elements after restore. However, we thought that we should let the user function code be free of responsibility of checkpointing watermarks, and let user code simply leave that to the streaming internals (checkpointed by window operators, and perhaps also by source operators).\r\n\r\nSo, essentially, the Kafka consumer should not need to checkpoint watermarks, and we can close this PR and the JIRA ticket.

Some where either these tests are creating more static objects or bigger objects that live for the life time of the JVM. May be this test exposes it. Actually this change in maxPermsize calls for a discussion on how the 'mvn' settings should be and what is the minimum size of heap required. Also in other projects the default jdk version is now moved to 8 atleast for the trunk version. I think similar thing can be done here.

Thanks a lot for the comments. The V4 PR implements the following:\r\n\r\n* Rebased on top of #3101 \r\n* `LogicalWindowAggregateRule` implements `RelOptRule` instead of the `ConvertRule`.\r\n* Instead of adding a new field in `LogicalWindowAggregate`, the implementation now transforms the original `LogicalAggregate(LogicalProject())` expression to `LogicalProject(LogicalWindowAggregate(LogicalProject(...)))`. The outermost projection ensures that the operators have the same row types before and after the transformation.\r\n\r\nPlease take another look.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/279843218/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/279851925","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3313#issuecomment-279851925","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3313","id":279851925,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3OTg1MTkyNQ==","user":{"login":"skonto","id":7945591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDU1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7945591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto","html_url":"https://github.com/skonto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-14T22:08:40Z","updated_at":"2017-02-14T22:08:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@thvasilo @tillrohrmann  pls review.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/279851925/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/279894888","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3197#issuecomment-279894888","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3197","id":279894888,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3OTg5NDg4OA==","user":{"login":"beyond1920","id":1525333,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjUzMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1525333?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beyond1920","html_url":"https://github.com/beyond1920","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beyond1920/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beyond1920/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beyond1920/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beyond1920/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beyond1920/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beyond1920/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beyond1920/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beyond1920/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beyond1920/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-15T01:53:31Z","updated_at":"2017-02-15T01:53:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@fhueske , thanks for your review.

I've incoporated all of your comments except:\r\n\r\n> Maybe you could override the DummyFlinkKafkaProducer#flush method to insert some latches to see when you enter and when the method is done. Then you could wait on the first latch and check with the latter whether the method has completed.\r\n\r\nI think this is over-complicating things. I don't think it makes sense to add ways to explicitly wait for the `flush` method to complete - it's called in the `snapshotState` method, so isn't it identical to waiting for the snapshot thread to complete?\r\n\r\nInstead, I override the `snapshotState` method and added a flag inside the to make sure that when the base `snapshotState` implementation returns, it returned only after it finished calling `flush`. Whether or not `flush` blocks correctly is out-of-scope of tests for `FlinkKafkaProducerBase`, because `flush` is actually an abstract method for Kafka version-specific concrete subclasses to implement.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/280016328/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/280016893","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3273#issuecomment-280016893","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3273","id":280016893,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MDAxNjg5Mw==","user":{"login":"twalthr","id":5746567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDY1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5746567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr","html_url":"https://github.com/twalthr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-15T13:56:53Z","updated_at":"2017-02-15T13:56:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks good to merge.
