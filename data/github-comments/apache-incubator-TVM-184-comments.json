So we do expect for longer review time, as well as more polishment.  \r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, what we want is not \"an implement\" of the feature. But to implement the feature in the best possible way so that it can be maintained, reused and developed in the future with minimum techinical debt.\r\n\r\nI am not expert in csharp, but by quickly look at the package, I do think it needs more careful works to reach to similar quality of our other language bindings. Here are some high level comments:\r\n\r\n- Structure:  think about a common structure. Take a look at existing projects for example\r\n   - e.g. mldotnet https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/tree/master/src\r\n   - A possible structure for tvm could be `root/donet/src/`\r\n   - I do not see any reason why we need a separate subfolder for each .cs file\r\n   -  We should not include binaries: e.g. add_one.dll into the code repo.\r\n   - There are additional files (Class1) which seems to be created from the the getting started guide but was not used here.\r\n- Naming: I would try to follow other language binding naming convention as much as possible, in particular, the web, java and golang one are good references. e.g. UnmanagedRuntime\r\n- Layers of abstractions: there are see many indirections and manager class(from manged to unmanaged), many of them seems to be un-necessary.  By convention, the FFI layer is un-managed, and all the wrappers on top are managed. Again, jvm runtime would be a good example to follow.\r\n- Given that a language binding needs to be maintained and reviewed separately, we should get someone who is able to collaborate and review the proposed binding. Since reviewing is as time consuming as implementing the feature, so please try to polish as much as you can.\r\n   - Ideally, we want to have as many vets on the API design as much as possible.\r\n\r\nYou could try release the package elsewhere and improve it a bit. Please also feel free to refer to other language bindings for reference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/626193368/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/626193743","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/5483#issuecomment-626193743","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5483","id":626193743,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNjE5Mzc0Mw==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-09T15:36:22Z","updated_at":"2020-05-09T15:36:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"THanks @spectrometerHBH @xqdan @junrushao1994 @Hzfengsy !","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/626193743/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/626194094","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/5498#issuecomment-626194094","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5498","id":626194094,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNjE5NDA5NA==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-09T15:38:51Z","updated_at":"2020-05-09T15:38:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"THanks @wpan11nv @Hzfengsy @roastduck !","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/626194094/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/626194301","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/5550#issuecomment-626194301","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5550","id":626194301,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNjE5NDMwMQ==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-09T15:40:16Z","updated_at":"2020-05-09T15:40:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"cc @icemelon9 @kevinthesun seems to be a typo in strategy refactor?

I have some queries to those as below:\r\n\r\n1. **Folder structure:** You are right it has no significance. It is just a personal choice to me in organizing the files. The reference(mldotnet) you have suggested also follow similar organization of files. \r\n    But if you think otherwise is more suitable, we can keep all the source codes in one place or maintain Managed & Unmanaged separation similar to JVM runtime(Core & Native).\r\n\r\n2. **Naming Convention:** Do you suggest the name change from UnmanagedRuntimeWrapper --> UnmanagedRuntime as an example ?\r\n     \r\n3. **Layers of abstractions:** You are right there is a very thin line boundary between Managed & Unmanaged space. Unmanaged space does not store any memory of its own in most of the cases, it is just an enabler or interface into TVM runtime. If you can provide one specific example which one you want to remove from Unmanged space, may be that might help me understand your comment more clearly.\r\n\r\n4. **Package Release:** I am not sure how to release package elsewhere and pertain to same PR.

The current compromise to still add them as attrs comes from the fact we can only access attrs in some function such as infer type. In this sense, whether we set these extra attrs as ```Optional<Integer>``` or ```Expr``` won't simplify or eliminate such duplication. IMHO, using ```Expr``` here simplifies the concept that these attrs are just duplications of some symbolic inputs, instead of constant conversion of symbolic inputs in the case they are Constant, if we pick ```Optional<Integer>```. Also in the current paradigm, using ```Expr``` guarantees we can always access those symbolic inputs through attrs, though I'm not sure how important this is.\r\n\r\nAnother thing is this decision affects other existing and ongoing symbolic ops, such as arange, [reshape](https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/pull/5429) and [strided_slice](https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/pull/4312).

The simplest solution(which is also reasonable) is to give up the symbolic relation for now and infers any .\r\n\r\nWe could certainly also register another kind of InferType function that can peek into constant inputs, to give richer types, although only constant will be supported.\r\n\r\nA more robust solution might involve partial evaluation(to evaluate symbolic constants) and then use analysis to add type annotations.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/626956817/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/626960714","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/5362#issuecomment-626960714","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5362","id":626960714,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNjk2MDcxNA==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-11T21:00:15Z","updated_at":"2020-05-11T21:00:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"see https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/issues/5458","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/626960714/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/626982255","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/5459#issuecomment-626982255","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5459","id":626982255,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNjk4MjI1NQ==","user":{"login":"kevinthesun","id":15520525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTIwNTI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15520525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinthesun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-11T21:44:55Z","updated_at":"2020-05-11T21:44:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"OK.
