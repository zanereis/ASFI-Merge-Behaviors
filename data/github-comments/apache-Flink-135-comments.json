Instead of storing a single scopeString we should store N strings, where N is the number of reporters. In addition, N filters should be stored as well for comparison.\n\nDo you propose replace `CharacterFilter firstFilter` to `List<CharacterFilter> filters` and  `String scopeString` to `List <String> scopeString` ? and we get scopeString and filter for reportes via

I'm sorry for the late response.\n\nI recently started moving some of the streaming connectors of Flink to Apache Bahir, a community for extensions to Spark, Flink (and maybe others).\nYou wrote in an earlier comment:\n\n>  I think it's both ok to keep this in the core or as an separated project, but the concern is it maybe better for community development to centralize qualified libraries togather.\n\nI think Bahir is addressing this issue nicely. So far we added only streaming connectors to Bahir, but I would like to see libraries and other things build on top of Flink there as well.\nI'm a committer at Bahir and can help you to get the code in there.\nThe Bahir repository is located here https://github.com/apache/bahir-flink\n\nBy the way, the tests you've added are failing on our CI system. Can you look into it? https://s3.amazonaws.com/archive.travis-ci.org/jobs/166483919/log.txt\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/255733558/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/255743401","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2671#issuecomment-255743401","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2671","id":255743401,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NTc0MzQwMQ==","user":{"login":"mxm","id":837221,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNzIyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/837221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm","html_url":"https://github.com/mxm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-24T13:41:29Z","updated_at":"2016-10-24T13:41:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for having a look @aljoscha.
