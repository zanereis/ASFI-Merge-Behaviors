But, I'm also against using Hadoop's bundled libs for same reason I'm against bundling our own. I'm in favor of intentional and thoughtful dependency convergence, as a downstream activity. I'd actually prefer we not ship any binary tarball packaging... but since we do, we might as well do it in a way that works well for most users.
