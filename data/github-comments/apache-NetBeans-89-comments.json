With that applied glassfish comes up without exceptions, in contrast to the situation in this PR where exceptions are generated about inaccessibles classes. Given that the domain.xml opens more packages, than the change proposed here, this looks sane.\r\n\r\nI cannot do any testing from my side, but it seems to really solve the issue nicely.

Which might later lead to revising this?\r\n\r\nHopefully the operation is idempotent: if the nb-javac modules are already in, nothing happens. Of course, if the catalog isn't produced during the build, this piece of Ant script has to be deleted as well.\r\n\r\n> One question for both would be - what's the mechanism for disabling nb-javac when bundled, possibly for testing, but also when release target is higher (eg. 17-EA) than supported by nb-javac?\r\n\r\nI usually use\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ find netbeans | grep nbjavac | xargs rm\r\n```\r\nbut I agree, it is not very end-user friendly. If nb-javac is visible in \"Tools/Plugins\", users of NetBeans IDE could potentially disable it.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/905164474/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/905165868","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/3118#issuecomment-905165868","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/3118","id":905165868,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M4187ws","user":{"login":"JaroslavTulach","id":26887752,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODg3NzUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26887752?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach","html_url":"https://github.com/JaroslavTulach","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-25T04:07:46Z","updated_at":"2021-08-25T04:08:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> That's nice.\r\n> ... anyone could write a VSCode extension that would install some NB modules to extend the VSCode functionality.\r\n\r\nYes, this was always the goal!
