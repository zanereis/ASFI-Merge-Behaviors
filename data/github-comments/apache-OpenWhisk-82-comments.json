For me the issue was `python-dev` install command failed. I manage to fix the issue by reordering `all.sh`. I moved `ansible.sh` after `pip.sh`. This seems to be working. I have not yet reached the end as currently docker images are being pulled but I have at least moved past `python-dev` error.

The explicit introduction of `1` in the stepSizes is needed because for N = 2 (for example), we must include it for completeness.  Inclusion must be separate due to the way the sieve works.\r\n3.

am not sure this should be discussed in a separate issue.\r\nBut I hope this could be addressed too.\r\n\r\nSituation is as follow:\r\n\r\n1. I have two running invokers.\r\n2. User sends action invocation request.\r\n3. At the same time, one invoker which is in charge of invoking the request is down.\r\n4. It takes some time(5~10 secs) for controller to catch up the situation(invoker is down).\r\n5. Accordingly, controller tries to send request to the abnormal invoker.\r\n6. Controller can not receive proper response.\r\n7. (At this point, I expect request will be automatically redirected to normal invoker but) Controller respond with failed response to client though there is running invoker.\r\n\r\nThis is because currently, there are kafka topics for each invokers.\r\nAnd controller regularly checks the health of invokers with health topic.\r\nSo until the next check, controller will recognize the unhealthy invoker as health invoker.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, even though we deploy multiple invokers, we can not make invokers high available.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think there are two options.\r\n\r\n1. Make invokers to share one kafka topic.\r\n2. Make controller(or loadbalancer) redirect the request to healthy invoker in case of failure.\r\n\r\n\r\n**1. Make invokers to share one kafka topic.**\r\n\r\nIf we can make invokers to share one kafka topic, this situation could be handled.\r\nThen each invokers will be grouped as one consumer group.\r\nIn case of failure of a target invoker, request will be automatically redirected to healthy invoker at kafka layer.\r\n\r\nAFAIK, same request should be sent to same invoker to take advantage of warm container, so there are topics for each invoker.\r\nSo if we take this approach, any invokers should be able to handle any warm containers(which is not created by themselves).\r\nEven though different invoker receives the same request, the invoker could activate warm container again.\r\n\r\nI am not sure this could be easily achievable with current implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n**2. Controller(or loadbalancer) redirect the request to healthy invoker in case of failure.**\r\n\r\nThis approach is to make controller do what kafka does.\r\nIn case of failure, controller should redirect the request to healthy invoker rather than just respond with fail response.\r\n\r\nSince many things are already considered in Kafka side, I am inclined to first option.\r\n\r\n\r\nI want you guys to check on this issue too.\r\nIf required, I will create an separate issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/307989249/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/307994979","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/2248#issuecomment-307994979","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/2248","id":307994979,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNzk5NDk3OQ==","user":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-13T03:17:40Z","updated_at":"2017-06-13T03:17:40Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I believe Markus already has.

It created a situation where all the cli tests are in the core repo. So we cannot accept any cli changes because of a circular dependence we can't break easily when cli changes are also required. So for example if there is a cli change and accompanying test changes, the tests in the core repo will be incompatible with the cli version pulled from the cli repo. I think we need to continue building the cli from this local copy until such time when all the accompanying tests are moved to the cli repo.
