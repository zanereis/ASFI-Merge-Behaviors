Another factor I think should be noted that batch normalization need relative large batch size to guarantee stabilization.\n\n@piiswrong I also have the same puzzle for the speed boost using multi-GPUs of multi-machines. For the reasons above, The batch size each GPU seem have the minimum bound (e.g. 32 imgs per batch). Assuming the batch size of 256 is enough for the task, eight GPUs in one machine is used to run. Dose it mean that I have no chance to further speed up the training even if I have two or more machines each with eight GPUs?\n\nMore generally, **what is the best practice for accelerating the training by using enough computational resource?** Does multi-cards of multi-machines have the limitation in speed boosting due to the structural problem coming from the way of SGD optimization?\n\nAny suggestions?
