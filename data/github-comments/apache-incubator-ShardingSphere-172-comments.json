It's make `expr` more conducive to reuse.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class ExpectedExpression extends AbstractExpectedSQLSegment {\r\n\r\n      @XmlElement(name = \"between-expression\")\r\n      private ExpectedBetweenExpression betweenExpression;\r\n\r\n      @XmlElement(name = \"binary-operation-expression\")\r\n      private ExpectedBinaryOperationExpression binaryOperationExpression;\r\n\r\n      @XmlElement(name = \"column\")\r\n      private ExpectedColumn column;\r\n\r\n      @XmlElement(name = \"common-expression\")\r\n      private ExpectedCommonExpression commonExpression;\r\n\r\n      @XmlElement(name = \"exists-subquery\")\r\n      private ExpectedExistsSubquery existsSubquery;\r\n\r\n      @XmlElement(name = \"expression-projection\")\r\n      private ExpectedExpressionProjection expressionProjection;\r\n\r\n      @XmlElement(name = \"in-expression\")\r\n      private ExpectedInExpression inExpression;\r\n\r\n      @XmlElement(name = \"list-expression\")\r\n      private ExpectedListExpression listExpression;\r\n\r\n      @XmlElement(name = \"literal-expression\")\r\n      private ExpectedLiteralExpression literalExpression;\r\n\r\n      @XmlElement(name = \"not-expression\")\r\n      private ExpectedNotExpression notExpression;\r\n\r\n      @XmlElement(name = \"parameter-marker-expression\")\r\n      private ExpectedParameterMarkerExpression parameterMarkerExpression;\r\n\r\n      @XmlElement(name = \"subquery\")\r\n      private ExpectedSubquery subquery;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n- **OtherExpression**\r\n\r\nOnly `ExpectedBinaryOperationExpression` is displayed here, and others are similar to it.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class ExpectedBinaryOperationExpression extends AbstractExpectedSQLSegment {\r\n    @XmlElement(name = \"left\")\r\n    private ExpectedExpression left;\r\n\r\n    @XmlElement(name = \"operator\")\r\n    private ExpectedOperator operator;\r\n\r\n    @XmlElement(name = \"right\")\r\n    private ExpectedExpression right;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n- **Test Case Example**\r\n\r\nThis is an example that includes all types of sub-expressions.\r\n\r\n  -  `SQL`\r\n\r\n  ```sql\r\n  SELECT * FROM t_order\r\n  WHERE (SELECT order_id FROM t_order_item WHERE status > ?)\r\n  OR EXISTS (SELECT order_id FROM t_order_item)\r\n  OR order_id ->\"$[1]\"\r\n  OR NOT order_id IN (1, 2, 3)\r\n  OR order_id BETWEEN 1 AND 3\r\n  OR order_id + INTERVAL 1 SECOND;\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  -  `Test Case`\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<select>\r\n   <from start-index=\"14\" stop-index=\"20\">\r\n      <simple-table name=\"t_order\" start-index=\"14\" stop-index=\"20\" />\r\n   </from>\r\n   <projections

\r\n\r\nCoreRules:Just rules that perform logical(not physical,Iterable) transformations on relational expressions.Generally used for RBO.This step mainly applies some heuristic rules, which are rule-based optimizer (RBO), so it is often called RBO stage.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to implement the custom adaptor for federated queries.\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nWe need to consider SQL optimization. If we use Calcite JDBC Driver, the only way to affect the optimization process is to override the interface for different kinds of tables like TranslatableTable and provide RelOptRule.\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we may try to skip Calcite JDBC Driver and call the parse, validate, optimize and execute functions in our new custom execute Driver, which needs a in-depth understanding about the source code of Calcite and coding work.\r\n\r\nCalcite JDBC Driver provides some default advanced features including\r\nlattice,Materialized Views.Or you can use\r\n```\r\norg.apache.calcite.tools.FrameworkConfig\r\norg.apache.calcite.tools.Frameworks\r\norg.apache.calcite.prepare.PlannerImpl\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt may maintain the function of calcite jdbc

broad SQL support as our SQL parser can parse SQLs from different databases dialects.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, it can be
