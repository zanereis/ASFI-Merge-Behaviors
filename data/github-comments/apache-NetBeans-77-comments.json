There's a lot about the \"right\" way to do it.\r\n\r\nMost import for a *near term solution* is Jan's analysis.\r\n\r\n> I don't think it would be so bad. The zip with the binaries is unpacked by\r\n> the build process, and (AFAIK) only this unpacked version is used in the\r\n> product. It would be trivial to have another AL2-licensed zip, which would\r\n> be unpacked over the unpacked CDDL licensed zip, overwriting same-named\r\n> files.\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n> Overall, my suggestion would be to create a new zip for the AL2-licensed\r\n> profiler binaries, and unpack it over the unpacked content of the existing\r\n> CDDL-licensed archive.
