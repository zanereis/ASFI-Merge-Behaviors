because the node.js environment doesn't have the `callNative` method. You should mock that method in tests.\r\n\r\n1. Import `sinon`, which is already in the `devDependencies` of package.json.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport sinon from 'sinon'\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Spy the `callNative` API.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n\r\ndescribe('vanilla test', () => {\r\n  // In case there did has callNative in the environment\r\n  const originalCallNative = global.callNative\r\n\r\n  const callNativeSpy = sinon.spy()\r\n  before(() => {\r\n    global.callNative = callNativeSpy\r\n  })\r\n\r\n  afterEach(() => {\r\n    callNativeSpy.reset()\r\n  })\r\n\r\n  after(() => {\r\n    global.callNative = originalCallNative\r\n  })\r\n\r\n  it('...', ()  => {})\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nMoreover, you can use `callNativeSpy` to check the parameter of call native tasks.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-weex/issues/comments/287681872/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-weex/issues/comments/287708958","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-weex/pull/120#issuecomment-287708958","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-weex/issues/120","id":287708958,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NzcwODk1OA==","user":{"login":"Jinjiang","id":206848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/206848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jinjiang","html_url":"https://github.com/Jinjiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jinjiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jinjiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jinjiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jinjiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jinjiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jinjiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jinjiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jinjiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jinjiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-20T09:23:20Z","updated_at":"2017-03-20T09:23:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-weex/issues/comments/287708958/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-weex/issues/comments/287744831","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-weex/pull/134#issuecomment-287744831","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-weex/issues/134","id":287744831,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4Nzc0NDgzMQ==","user":{"login":"weex-bot","id":26158071,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MTU4MDcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26158071?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weex-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/weex-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weex-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weex-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weex-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weex-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weex-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weex-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weex-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weex-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weex-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-20T12:26:18Z","updated_at":"2017-03-20T12:26:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\n<!--\n  0 failure: \n  1 warning:  Potential BREAK C...\n  \n  \n-->\n\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th width=\"50\"></th>\n      <th width=\"100%\" data-danger-table=\"true\">Warnings</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody><tr>\n      <td>:warning:</td>\n      <td>Potential BREAK CHANGE.
