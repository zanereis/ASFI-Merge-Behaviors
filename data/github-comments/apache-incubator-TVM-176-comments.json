That is when input channel is  1 (for example, gray image), we will get depthwise convolution of multiplier greater than 1 rather than normal convolution.  Would you mind doing one performance comparison? I expect we could get better performance when we use normal convolution.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/610737656/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/610771579","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/5272#issuecomment-610771579","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5272","id":610771579,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxMDc3MTU3OQ==","user":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-08T06:14:03Z","updated_at":"2020-04-08T06:14:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@tqchen I got segfault in CI that is not related to this PR.

Requantize is the bottleneck in my observation on Rasp Pi 4. For TFLite quantized mobilenetv1, currently with master + auto-tuning, I get 56 ms (TFLite is 35 ms).  Upon deeper analysis, I found requantize to be the bottleneck (even with UPWARD rounding which is the cheapest). The reason is that calculations happen in int64 and either ARM does not have good instructions or LLVM does not pick up the right instructions.\r\n\r\nAs an experiment, I forced the datatype of Requantize to be int32. This will lead to bad accuracy but it will give us an idea what is the minimum latency of Requantize op. The runtime reduced from earlier 56 ms to 36 ms (almost as good as TFLite). So, requantize is the bottleneck.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we should notice that TFLite rounding is not a standard rounding. They have moved backwards from the ARM instructions they want to use. Because of that they have 2 roundings instead of 1 - 1 in `SaturatingRoundingDoublingHighMul` (non-standard rounding) and other is \r\n`RoundingDivideByPOT` (standard). Given there are 2 roundings, they have also made an accuracy-performance tradeoff. So, my suggestion is that we should also wisely think if it makes sense to completely follow TFLite rounding as the golden reference. For example, following reference function\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n// This function implements the same computation as the ARMv7 NEON VQRDMULH\r\n// instruction.\r\n\r\ntemplate <>\r\ninline std::int32_t SaturatingRoundingDoublingHighMul(std::int32_t a,\r\n                                                      std::int32_t b) {\r\n  bool overflow = a == b && a == std::numeric_limits<std::int32_t>::min();\r\n  std::int64_t a_64(a);\r\n  std::int64_t b_64(b);\r\n  std::int64_t ab_64 = a_64 * b_64;\r\n  std::int32_t nudge = ab_64 >= 0 ? (1 << 30) : (1 - (1 << 30));\r\n  std::int32_t ab_x2_high32 =\r\n      static_cast<std::int32_t>((ab_64 + nudge) / (1ll << 31));\r\n  return overflow ? std::numeric_limits<std::int32_t>::max() : ab_x2_high32;\r\n}\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nThis function alone needs around 10 Relay ops (if not more), but in TFLite this is just  1 ARM instruction - VQRDMULH. I doubt that LLVM will be able to use that instruction automatically.\r\n\r\nIn summary, I understand the benefits of exact match between TFLite and TVM. But in contrast to FP32 networks, this is one of the cases, where frameworks have made their choice to tradeoff perf and accuracy for a specific ARM device. Note that with non-TFLite rounding, the application accuracy is still similar, so it might be an acceptable tradeoff. Therefore, I would encourage to think more deeply. I worry that the extensive work going in this PR might need major reconsideration when we dont see good performance improvements.\r\n\r\nIf we relax the exact tensor match criteria, there might be other ways to get the perfromance like using tensorize.\r\n \r\n@u99127 @masahi might also be interested in this.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/611068109/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/611071742","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4828#issuecomment-611071742","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4828","id":611071742,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxMTA3MTc0Mg==","user":{"login":"u99127","id":19559067,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTU5MDY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19559067?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/u99127","html_url":"https://github.com/u99127","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/u99127/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/u99127/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/u99127/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/u99127/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/u99127/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/u99127/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/u99127/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/u99127/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/u99127/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-08T16:53:46Z","updated_at":"2020-04-08T16:53:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> \r\n> \r\n> Actually, Requantize is the bottleneck in my observation on Rasp Pi 4.

If a user wants to have a QNN model then she will run the QNN pass first anyhow to generate QNN ops in the graph. Under this assumption, if a codegen doesn't want to see QNN ops, it should not have fannotate and AnnotateTarget will annotate QNN ops to other codegens or just default.\r\n\r\n> * What's the advantage of this multi-target approach over running the entire partitioning pipeline multiple times?\r\nI think I understand your concern more after this question. You're saying if a user wants to offload a graph to multiple targets then she will run AnnotateTarget->MergeCompilerRegion->PartitionGraph multiple times. IMHO, this is not an ideal flow due to the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. If the flow is designed for offloading only one target, it's hard to consider global optimization over multiple targets in the future. For example, 1st run with TargetA creates 2 subgraphs due to restriction set; 2nd run with TargetB creates 1 subgraph (so 3 subgraphs in total). However, assuming the second subgraph for TargetA can also be offloaded to TargetB, meaning that if we run TargetB first than we will get 2 subgraphs in total.\r\n2. If the flow may take a graph that has been partitioned by another target in advance, all passes in this flow will need to deal with partitioned functions. It's hard to maintain and even harder to integrate global optimization in the above situation.\r\n3. The position of PartitionGraph in the pass manager is meaningful. We guarantee external functions generated by this pass can be processed by following passes, but not others.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/611078702/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/611080548","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4828#issuecomment-611080548","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4828","id":611080548,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxMTA4MDU0OA==","user":{"login":"anijain2305","id":13822661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODIyNjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13822661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305","html_url":"https://github.com/anijain2305","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-08T17:11:23Z","updated_at":"2020-04-08T17:11:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Moving to discuss as we are talking a lot :)\r\n\r\nhttps://discuss.tvm.ai/t/tflite-rounding/6287","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/611080548/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/611084398","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/5277#issuecomment-611084398","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5277","id":611084398,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxMTA4NDM5OA==","user":{"login":"mbaret","id":55580676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTgwNjc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55580676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret","html_url":"https://github.com/mbaret","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-08T17:19:05Z","updated_at":"2020-04-08T17:19:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"To explain the point about QNN a bit better, a concrete example would be our Ethos-N NPU codegen paired up with something like DNNL.

For TFLite quantized mobilenetv1, currently with master + auto-tuning, I get 56 ms (TFLite is 35 ms).  Upon deeper analysis, I found requantize to be the bottleneck (even with UPWARD rounding which is the cheapest). The reason is that calculations happen in int64 and either ARM does not have good instructions or LLVM does not pick up the right instructions.\n> \n> \n> \n> As an experiment, I forced the datatype of Requantize to be int32. This will lead to bad accuracy but it will give us an idea what is the minimum latency of Requantize op. The runtime reduced from earlier 56 ms to 36 ms (almost as good as TFLite). So, requantize is the bottleneck.\n> \n> \n> \n> Additionally, we should notice that TFLite rounding is not a standard rounding. They have moved backwards from the ARM instructions they want to use. Because of that they have 2 roundings instead of 1 - 1 in `SaturatingRoundingDoublingHighMul` (non-standard rounding) and other is \n> \n> `RoundingDivideByPOT` (standard). Given there are 2 roundings, they have also made an accuracy-performance tradeoff. So, my suggestion is that we should also wisely think if it makes sense to completely follow TFLite rounding as the golden reference. For example, following reference function\n> \n> \n> \n> ~~~\n> \n> // This function implements the same computation as the ARMv7 NEON VQRDMULH\n> \n> // instruction.\n> \n> \n> \n> template <>\n> \n> inline std::int32_t SaturatingRoundingDoublingHighMul(std::int32_t a,\n> \n>                                                       std::int32_t b) {\n> \n>   bool overflow = a == b && a == std::numeric_limits<std::int32_t>::min();\n> \n>   std::int64_t a_64(a);\n> \n>   std::int64_t b_64(b);\n> \n>   std::int64_t ab_64 = a_64 * b_64;\n> \n>   std::int32_t nudge = ab_64 >= 0 ? (1 << 30) : (1 - (1 << 30));\n> \n>   std::int32_t ab_x2_high32 =\n> \n>       static_cast<std::int32_t>((ab_64 + nudge) / (1ll << 31));\n> \n>   return overflow ? std::numeric_limits<std::int32_t>::max() : ab_x2_high32;\n> \n> }\n> \n> ~~~\n> \n> \n> \n> This function alone needs around 10 Relay ops (if not more), but in TFLite this is just  1 ARM instruction - VQRDMULH. I doubt that LLVM will be able to use that instruction automatically.\n> \n> \n> \n> In summary, I understand the benefits of exact match between TFLite and TVM. But in contrast to FP32 networks, this is one of the cases, where frameworks have made their choice to tradeoff perf and accuracy for a specific ARM device. Note that with non-TFLite rounding, the application accuracy is still similar, so it might be an acceptable tradeoff. Therefore, I would encourage to think more deeply. I worry that the extensive work going in this PR might need major reconsideration when we dont see good performance improvements.\n> \n> \n> \n> If we relax the exact tensor match criteria, there might be other ways to get the perfromance like using tensorize.\n> \n>  \n> \n> @u99127 @masahi might also be interested in this.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n> \n> \n\nPlease note [this thread](https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/supporting-bit-exact-tflite-qnn-inference/5528), if we don’t have bit-extract result, we will have many problems, not just trade off. Mobilenet accuracy result is not enough.\n\nYou could also one [blog](https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm-site/pull/2) how do boost the quant perf. Inside it, we could get the bit-extract result and use the same rouding of TFLite, but we could beat TFLite performance a lot. However, the design has a little bit, we design to implement one q_conv2d / q_requantize to contorl it. For q_conv2d, we tensorize it and do requantize inside it. For depthwise convolution, we even not tensorize and use q_conv2d + q_requantize, we could still beat TFLite and QNNPack a lot. Out current design of one problem is we lower too many ops and can not make sure all computations inside register and NCHW has bad cache like previous blog said.\n\nWe should make sure functionality firstly. Then we consider the performance. I think it is not only the arm instruction you mention but also many other things we need to do.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/611288188/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/611288745","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/5230#issuecomment-611288745","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5230","id":611288745,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxMTI4ODc0NQ==","user":{"login":"FrozenGene","id":7287321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyODczMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7287321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene","html_url":"https://github.com/FrozenGene","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-09T02:13:44Z","updated_at":"2020-04-09T02:13:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> @FrozenGene It is not possible to use depthwise conv inside Relay here.

For example we feed the input (1, 224, 224, 1)，in our tensorflow we have convolution to handle it. i.e. `input -> convolution`. However, the tflite will change the convolution into depthwise convolution with multiplier greater than 1, the input channel will be 1.  Like this picture of tensorflow issue:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7287321/78855497-a5766f80-7a56-11ea-92d3-96590ffb4fae.png)\r\nI suspect if we don't change to depthwise convolution with multiplier greater than 1 and keep the original convolution, like this:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7287321/78855555-c8088880-7a56-11ea-8fe7-c4bb0183a998.png)\r\nWe could get better performance.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/611310639/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/611312094","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/5252#issuecomment-611312094","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5252","id":611312094,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxMTMxMjA5NA==","user":{"login":"FrozenGene","id":7287321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyODczMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7287321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene","html_url":"https://github.com/FrozenGene","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-09T03:46:49Z","updated_at":"2020-04-09T03:46:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"LGTM except one last comment. @kparzysz-quic Could you fix the CI?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/611312094/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/611319144","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/5230#issuecomment-611319144","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5230","id":611319144,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxMTMxOTE0NA==","user":{"login":"anijain2305","id":13822661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODIyNjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13822661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305","html_url":"https://github.com/anijain2305","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-09T04:19:14Z","updated_at":"2020-04-09T04:19:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Correct.

Convolution should be better I expect. However, I wish we could have one performance comparation result between these two ways. So that we decide whether we keep depthwise convolution with multiplier greater than 1 or like this pr converting back to normal convolution finally.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/611330944/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/611332083","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/5285#issuecomment-611332083","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5285","id":611332083,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxMTMzMjA4Mw==","user":{"login":"zhiics","id":5145158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDUxNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5145158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics","html_url":"https://github.com/zhiics","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-09T05:12:41Z","updated_at":"2020-04-09T05:12:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I rebooted the machine.

> Correct. So here, TFLite converts Conv to depthwise conv, where depthwise conv has input_channels = groups = 1 and depth multiplier > 1\r\n> > This PR converts this type of depthwise conv back to normal conv. Exactly the same way that you are suggesting. (There is not even a way to run Relay depthwise conv with groups = 1)\r\n> > Let us know if that is ok.\r\n> \r\n> Yes. Convolution should be better I expect. However, I wish we could have one performance comparation result between these two ways. So that we decide whether we keep depthwise convolution with multiplier greater than 1 or like this pr converting back to normal convolution finally.\r\n\r\n@FrozenGene I think I have not clarified the issue why we are converting the kernel layout for HWOI to HWIO when number of input channels is 1.\r\n\r\nFirst, let us take the example of the current scenario\r\n```\r\nparams['kernel_layout'] = 'HWOI'\r\n```\r\n\r\nAssuming you have a network you mentioned before with depthwise convolution with input_channel = 1 and try to parse a Relay graph using the `from_tflite` API you get an error like this\r\n\r\n```\r\nv0.0.4\r\nfn (%input: Tensor[(1, 76, 64, 1), uint8], %v_param_1: Tensor[(64, 1), uint8], %v_param_2: Tensor[(1, 64, 1), uint8], %v_param_3: Tensor[(9, 5, 1, 96), uint8], ...) {\r\n  %0 = qnn.subtract(%input, %v_param_1, ...);\r\n  %1 = qnn.mul(%0, %v_param_2, ...);\r\n  %2 = qnn.conv2d(%1, %v_param_3, ..., data_layout=\"NHWC\", kernel_layout=\"HWOI\", out_dtype=\"int32\") in particular dimension 2 conflicts 96 does not match 1dimension 3 conflicts 1 does not match 96; unable to unify: `Tensor[(9, 5, 96, 1), uint8]` and `Tensor[(9, 5, 1, 96), uint8]`; ;\r\n```\r\nThe change \r\n```\r\nparams['kernel_layout'] = 'HWIO' if input_c == 1 else 'HWOI'\r\n```\r\nfixes this issue.\r\n\r\nThis error happens because input_channel is 1 and in the [Conv2dRel](https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/blob/master/src/relay/op/nn/convolution.h#L132-L391) function fails as there are checks for `param->groups > 1`. So this fix is mainly to get the current implementation working.\r\n\r\nIn order to do the benchmarking, you are suggesting we need to change the underlying `Conv2dRel` functionality which I think should be part of another PR and RFC perhaps.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/611724091/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/611743041","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/5282#issuecomment-611743041","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5282","id":611743041,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxMTc0MzA0MQ==","user":{"login":"kparzysz-quic","id":48801706,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4ODAxNzA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48801706?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic","html_url":"https://github.com/kparzysz-quic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-09T20:42:41Z","updated_at":"2020-04-09T20:42:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Same failure again: https://ci.tvm.ai/blue/organizations/jenkins/tvm/detail/PR-5282/9/pipeline/152...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/611743041/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/611758714","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/5272#issuecomment-611758714","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5272","id":611758714,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxMTc1ODcxNA==","user":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-09T21:21:40Z","updated_at":"2020-04-09T21:23:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Although I still feel this is a bit ad-hoc, it should be fine for now as we only use DNNL as an example to demonstrate external codegen.\r\n\r\nWhat is still ad-hoc?
