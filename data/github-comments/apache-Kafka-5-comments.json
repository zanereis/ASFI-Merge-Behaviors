I reorganized everything under a copycat directory, let me know if the new organization makes more sense. On merging data + api, given the discussion in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-2367, we may just drop the data package altogether. I personally prefer keeping the api in a separate jar from the runtime, which I think ensures very clear boundaries for connector developers.\n\n@gwenshap Followed up on a bunch of your comments. I _think_ I've addressed all your comments that weren't going to be discussed more on the mailing list.\n\nI also marked a bunch of public classes in copycat as unstable since we now have that annotation. I didn't mark _everything_ however. I just focused on the classes that are really public and \"entry points\" to the API. We can do this more comprehensively, but I wasn't sure it really makes sense (e.g. will marking `WorkerSinkTaskThread` as unstable really help anyone anyway?). Let me know if you think we should mark every class.\n\nFinally, any thoughts on the exception hierarchy? Shall I get rid of the checked vs. runtime exception distinction? And shall I make CopycatException inherit from KafkaException? I'm thinking this may become important for embedded mode, where in some cases it would be nice to be able to catch any Copycat/Kstreams/Kafka client exception with a single catch block.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/130526866/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/130527625","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/99#issuecomment-130527625","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/99","id":130527625,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMDUyNzYyNQ==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-13T04:20:29Z","updated_at":"2015-08-13T04:20:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[kafka-trunk-git-pr

It also has confusing semantics.\n\nI think what @ewencp was suggesting with the `ConsumerListener` interface is basically another approach to the problem that the `ConsumerSeekCallback` is trying to address. We all agree that the user needs some way to be able to handle out of range errors. The weird thing with the seek callback is that it only allows the user to hook into out of range errors when they seek, but these errors are an ongoing concern during the lifetime of the consumer. You might seek, fetch successfully, and then get an out of range error on the next fetch. The seek callback doesn't help you in that case, so you have to resort to catching exceptions. The question is whether we would need `ConsumerSeekCallback` any more if we had a `ConsumerListener` which provided a general hook for out of range errors. The nice thing is that it bypasses the weirdness of when the position gets updated and when the seek callback gets invoked. What do you think?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/130775076/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/130777065","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/136#issuecomment-130777065","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/136","id":130777065,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMDc3NzA2NQ==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-13T17:47:21Z","updated_at":"2015-08-13T17:47:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[kafka-trunk-git-pr

I agree that a ConsumerListener which provides a general hook for out of range errors is useful. What I try to understand is, whether there is a valid user case to have a callback for a specific seek. I just discussed with @becketqin and tend to think it can still be useful to provide callback in seek().\n\nAn out-of-range exception can happen for one of the three reasons: 1) invalid offset in seek, 2) unclean leader election, and 3) consumer lags behind too much. One reasonable strategy that I envision is that, consumer will throw exception and quit for 1), reset offset to latest for 2), and reset offset to earliest for 3). Such a strategy can be implemented using a combination of ConsumerSeekCallback and ConsumerListener, but not with ConsumerListener alone.

I do see some value in being able to handle an out-of-range error in the scope of a specific seek. I still think the behavior around when the position gets updated is a little weird, but perhaps documenting it clearly will be enough. We have to explain how it is synchronous in the sense that the position will be updated immediately and the next fetch will try to use it, but asynchronous in the sense that we can only find out if the position is valid after we try to fetch. It makes it a little tough to say when the seek is \"complete.\" Maybe instead of using `onComplete` in the callback, we could rename it to something which reflects this difference? Maybe `onValidated`?\n\nIt would be cool if there was an API on the broker to get the current range of a partition. Then we could have this method block while we check that the offset is in range. You could do it with the list offset request, but it seems like it would require two requests, which is annoying.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/130869860/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/130965435","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/99#issuecomment-130965435","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/99","id":130965435,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMDk2NTQzNQ==","user":{"login":"gwenshap","id":1189030,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODkwMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1189030?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap","html_url":"https://github.com/gwenshap","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-14T04:50:35Z","updated_at":"2015-08-14T04:50:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I agree there's no need to mark the stability of the internals.

catch, I unfortunately missed that because those SocketServerTests are always failing for me, so I expect those error messages at the end of my test run currently...\n\nThis was due to a test that was written before the patch was applied but then applied via rebase + squash after the patch was applied. We'll need to watch out for these for a bit with the github PRs since you can issue a PR without having merged back with trunk (so if you just check out the branch it might pass the tests, but will fail when actually committed). I'm not sure if the jenkins build does a merge with trunk before running the build or not, which would protect against

I just updated patch to rename the callback to onResponse and updated API documentation to illustrate the reason that the callback is asynchronous.

I didn't find other bugs after having a quick look at the patch. \n\n@gwenshap Could you double check the patch to see if there are other similar bugs in KAFKA-2249.\n\nThanks!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/131865080/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/131889867","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/69#issuecomment-131889867","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/69","id":131889867,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMTg4OTg2Nw==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-17T17:01:28Z","updated_at":"2015-08-17T17:01:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[kafka-trunk-git-pr #156](https://builds.apache.org/job/kafka-trunk-git-pr/156/) SUCCESS\nThis pull request looks good\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/131889867/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/131892194","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/118#issuecomment-131892194","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/118","id":131892194,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMTg5MjE5NA==","user":{"login":"hachikuji","id":12502538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAyNTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12502538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji","html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-17T17:09:09Z","updated_at":"2015-08-17T17:09:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@lindong28 Yeah, I didn't like onValidated that much either. onResponse seems a little better.

Your approach is exactly the one I had in mind, but it does result in a little more overhead since metadata refreshes are done both in KafkaConsumer and in NetworkClient. The nice thing about separating them is that it lets you refresh the full metadata list less frequently. If your regex only covers a small set of the topics, then that makes \"normal\" metadata refreshes cheaper and they can be done more often. However, it seems a little questionable whether this capability is actually useful in practice, so reducing the metadata overhead might be the bigger win. What do you think? \n\n*Note that it's still useful to be able to bypass NetworkClient to support the listTopics API (which doesn't affect subscriptions).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/131931517/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/131948325","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/144#issuecomment-131948325","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/144","id":131948325,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMTk0ODMyNQ==","user":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-17T20:20:17Z","updated_at":"2015-08-17T20:20:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Is
