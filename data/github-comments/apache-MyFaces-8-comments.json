, I'm hitting the same issue you reported/fixed in `https://github.com/jakartaee/faces/pull/1799` with the MyFaces integration tests locally. I couldn't see where we have a similar code to how you fixed this in the TCK. However, these changes got me up and running. What do you think? Is there a way to make the same change that was made in the TCK or should we go with what I've proposed here?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/comments/1462621202/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/comments/1463343106","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/myfaces/pull/547#issuecomment-1463343106","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/547","id":1463343106,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB-dSOs5XONgC","user":{"login":"werpu","id":530547,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMDU0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/530547?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu","html_url":"https://github.com/werpu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-10T06:37:28Z","updated_at":"2023-03-10T06:46:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Merged!\r\n\r\nJust for the protocol (this is long but might be informative)\r\n\r\nAnother \"improvement\" still possible is the elimination of configs, but given the latest changes in the internal config data stuctures, there is little to gain from it no code reduction, no complexity reduction and no speed gain, only a tad closer to the language itself, atm. \r\n\r\nSo not worth the effort for now! In reality the configs just would be replaced by direct assoc arrays and function calls on top of them but the code basically stays the same mostly. \r\n\r\nSo I guess this would not really reduce complexity (config.assign(key1,key2,key3).value = \"foobaz\" would become assign(assocArray, key1,key2,key3).value = \"foobaz\").\r\n\r\nFor debugging purposes - configs now use a pure associative arrays with data only anyway as internal data structures, shifting a little bit away from the pure recursive functional approach used before - which made debugging the data somewhat hard, due to having configs and value holders in every layer)\r\nEither way should this change be wanted in the long run, the foundations for this are there (and used internally by the Config)\r\n\r\nA shift to pure assoc arrays probably will make sense as soon as Typescript allows constructs like\r\nassocArray ?.key1?.key2?.key3 = \"value\", which means allocate the access path if not existing before assigning the value.\r\nAtm this is just used as conditional read (so a one way street)\r\n\r\nAlso the code drop we could achieve here would probably only result in the reduction of code of 2 Kbyte - compressed. I did a preliminary prototype to see what the gain would be, it was mostly neclectable, there is more to gain by shifting the codebase gradually to newer ES versions, via the Typescript compiler. Like going from Es5 to Es2015 where prototype constructs and array loops were replaced by classes and real functional array patters.\r\n\r\nWe might see similar gains in the future. Thats also one of the huge advantages of using of Typescript, you are not bound to any javascript version anymore, and can ramp up as the time goes on without having to change a single line of code!\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/comments/1463343106/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/comments/1463639069","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/myfaces/pull/548#issuecomment-1463639069","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/548","id":1463639069,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB-dSOs5XPVwd","user":{"login":"bohmber","id":18034775,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDM0Nzc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18034775?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bohmber","html_url":"https://github.com/bohmber","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bohmber/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bohmber/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bohmber/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bohmber/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bohmber/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bohmber/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bohmber/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bohmber/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bohmber/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-10T11:02:58Z","updated_at":"2023-03-10T11:02:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@pnicolucci thanks for the suggestion will be used in #549 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/comments/1463639069/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
