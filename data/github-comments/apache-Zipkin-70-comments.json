is a thing now and the _right to be forgotten_ requires distributed long transactions across components. At Typeform we have the following use case.\r\n\r\n1. A user action triggers the account deletion which generates a message of deletion in the `user service`.\r\n2. This message is being consumed by many other components in the system, all of them doing long expensive operations of deletion. Some of them include database operations that we control (we can run them at once) but some others include async processes in 3rd parties (e.g. intercom, autopilot, segment, etc.) that we are constantly checking the status.\r\n\r\nIn terms of observing traces there are two options we explored:\r\n- We propagate the `RequestID` from the very first request being made by the user (a.k.a. clicking on the `Delete my account` button) and create different traces linked by a tag `RequestID`. This is weird but works.\r\n- We pile up everything in the same trace ending up in moster long trace which conceptually is weird: later hops are child of the initial http request but there is no sense in relating them as they don't affect the output of the very first operation nor the subsequent ones. They basically have nothing to do with the top parents but they are there just because we need a way to tie them.\r\n\r\nThe convenience of having linked traces is not only because we can group traces (that we could do with a tag) but also it allows use to have more meaningful traces, grouping all the effects of a single operations when it comes to async removes the focus from the child effects by them self.\r\n\r\nSo, could we consider this in the roadmap?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/387012821/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/387396382","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2022#issuecomment-387396382","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2022","id":387396382,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NzM5NjM4Mg==","user":{"login":"chuguoren","id":34712888,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NzEyODg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34712888?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chuguoren","html_url":"https://github.com/chuguoren","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chuguoren/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chuguoren/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chuguoren/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chuguoren/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chuguoren/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chuguoren/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chuguoren/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chuguoren/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chuguoren/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-08T13:09:12Z","updated_at":"2018-05-08T13:09:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Why not support custom builds?\r\nI want to register zipkin to eureka server, and also get configuration from spring config server.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/387396382/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/387412779","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2022#issuecomment-387412779","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2022","id":387412779,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NzQxMjc3OQ==","user":{"login":"nolan4954","id":16396189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk2MTg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16396189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nolan4954","html_url":"https://github.com/nolan4954","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nolan4954/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nolan4954/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nolan4954/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nolan4954/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nolan4954/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nolan4954/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nolan4954/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nolan4954/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nolan4954/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-08T14:01:50Z","updated_at":"2018-05-08T14:01:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I had resolved it.

Firstly, There is nothing stopping you from using custom builds. You can still use it at your own risk. For most of the users, the released versions are sufficient enough for running it production. If you're learning/exploring Zipkin, I would recommend using the released version and if you feel any limitations you can request that feature to be included in the core library or explore the option of running a custom build. \r\n@nolan4954 - FYI - The latest verision of Zipkin 2.8.4 is using Springboot 2.0.1 under the hood.

We have core committers who use eclipse.\r\n\r\nWRT workspace, we will continue to have both versions released until such time as we don't require both. Our collector code currently requires both libraries for interop. When I get back from holiday (21 May), I will start working on removing the last dependencies on v1.\r\n\r\nI'll mention point-by-point why there will be no action apart from removing the v1 code as soon as we can (which is at any rate a goal).\r\n\r\nokhttp is an example of another library which only differs on group ID and package name. It is one of the most popular libraries out there. From a packaging POV we are no different (ex okhttp.jar is for all versions). What's different between us and them is that we still release 2 packages (because we must! not because we are intentionally being annoying)\r\n\r\nMost users never have to import our source in the first place. Often times people are importing code, trying to make custom servers (which is unsupported). The larger audience of Zipkin are not affected by this in any way, as there is no such practice in wider repositories such as brave or zipkin-reporter.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: I'm closing this out as it will be addressed by removing the v1 library... to conserve hands for larger benefit and cause least disruption while accomplishing the same goal.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, I'd recommend joining gitter to chat with folks about whatever you are importing the code. You might not even need to be doing this.. Not checking out this repo is another way to not be annoyed by it! :D\r\nhttps://gitter.im/openzipkin/zipkin\r\n\r\nFinally, I understand your frustration and appreciate your telling us about it. Closing this issue doesn't mean we won't address the concern. It is just that we won't do it by reorganizing our group IDs etc. It will be by removing the codebase in question as soon as we can.

For example, the\nstorage layer can rebundle smaller, but only if the input was bundled in\nthe first place.

For example, we've long\nhad requests for http proxying (which isn't quite as safe as MQ based as\nthere's no buffer), but could help simplify a backend as that backend only\nneeds to talk zipkin2. The key here though is to not eliminate batching\nwhich is very much a norm in MQ, without forcing a change to other code\nwhich doesn't have batching by default. The reporter's async reporter does\nhave working bundling and it is all about the transport, less about\nstorage. Using that, or an approach derived from that has the least risk.\n\n\n> Once I submit the filter interface PR w/ quota filters; putting that stuff\n> in the senders will be dangerous because there is no guarantee that service\n> owners will depend on the correct sender lib and configure it correctly.\n>\nI'm not sure about the danger part, because we often limit things here\nanyway. For example, I don't expect us to make a configuration that is\ncompletely arbitrary. For example, I meant literally rabbit as that's the\nother supported MQ. Basically consider how this impacts design. If someone\ndoes something custom using the same code, and misconfigures it.. it is on\nthem. We are rather strict with what's supported and not, so yeah I would\ndefer this part (the policy from the mechanism)\n\nOn the quota filters and this change in general, I'd caution that depending\non how many features and how the code looks in general it might not be\nmerged as is. So please do proceed, but keep in mind it might be moved\naround, possibly to another repo like we do with zipkin-gcp depending on\nhow things go. It is really important to know the general features that\nwill be used in filtering to see the least code needed to accomplish it,\nand for example, some of it might move to collector v2.\n\nIn other words, please do put in code that does \"exactly\" what you need as\nwell, including filtering examples, so that when we think together about\nhow to enable this, we don't break it in the process.\n\nCheers and thanks tons!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/391541829/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/391648522","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/1948#issuecomment-391648522","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1948","id":391648522,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MTY0ODUyMg==","user":{"login":"michaelsembwever","id":559444,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1OTQ0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/559444?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelsembwever","html_url":"https://github.com/michaelsembwever","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelsembwever/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelsembwever/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelsembwever/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelsembwever/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelsembwever/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelsembwever/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelsembwever/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelsembwever/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelsembwever/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-24T09:22:59Z","updated_at":"2018-05-25T00:11:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":">
