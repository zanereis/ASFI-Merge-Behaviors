If so, what is the best way to emulate how Tranquility handles topics?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/215322855/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/215327072","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/2826#issuecomment-215327072","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2826","id":215327072,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNTMyNzA3Mg==","user":{"login":"redlion99","id":936350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzNjM1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/936350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/redlion99","html_url":"https://github.com/redlion99","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redlion99/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redlion99/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redlion99/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redlion99/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redlion99/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redlion99/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redlion99/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redlion99/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redlion99/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-28T06:48:30Z","updated_at":"2016-04-28T06:48:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This segment will not be closed during the next merge.\n\n2016-04-28T00:45:00,002 INFO [cl_events-overseer-2] io.druid.segment.realtime.plumber.RealtimePlumber - Starting merge and push.\n2016-04-28T00:45:00,002 INFO [cl_events-overseer-2] io.druid.segment.realtime.plumber.RealtimePlumber - Found [1] segments.

It's not entirely clear cut because the S3 logging is \"best effort delivery\" - delayed and not guaranteed. But attempting to reconstruct via the internal timestamps, it looks like on the polling period intervals, there is a bunch of activity that looks like this:\n\n```\n[redacted] REST.GET.BUCKET - \"GET /?max-keys=1000&prefix=lookups%2Fqa%2F&delimiter=%2F HTTP/1.1\" 200 - 2488 - 14 14 \"-\" \"JetS3t/0.9.4 (Linux/3.2.0-77-generic; amd64; en; JVM 1.8.0_20)\" -\n[redacted] REST.GET.OBJECT lookups/qa/customDims-truncated.tsv \"GET /lookups/qa/customDims-truncated.tsv HTTP/1.1\" 200 - 2392 2392 10 9 \"-\" \"JetS3t/0.9.4 (Linux/3.2.0-77-generic; amd64; en; JVM 1.8.0_20)\" -\n```\n\nThere is _at least_ one of these REST.GET.BUCKET/REST.GET.OBJECT pairs per configured lookup per polling period. I have some examples where there are 4 times the number of lookups. :frowning: So yeah, I'd say the jets3t code is doing more than just checking metadata all right.\n\nI'm too embarassed to say how much of an S3 bill I ran up before noticing this, and it's my own fault for not being sure to have the Druid instance co-located with S3 to avoid charges. But at least putting a warning in the documentation right away seems like a good idea! (And maybe a separate issue to track it?)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/215574593/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/215575097","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/2523#issuecomment-215575097","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2523","id":215575097,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNTU3NTA5Nw==","user":{"login":"drcrallen","id":8213081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMTMwODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8213081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen","html_url":"https://github.com/drcrallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-28T21:57:39Z","updated_at":"2016-04-28T21:57:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ryryguy

We tested it, made some nice-to-have modifications to it and this extension is currently slated for a stage release and later a prod release in the coming weeks. This is to say that we too believe that this contribution is in a good state.\n\nThings that we discussed /changed internally at our company:\n- as a general thing, there are emitter extensions for graphite, statsd, ganglia and talks about datadog. However, all these extensions are separate but very similar code. We wondered whether it might be desirable and feasible to instead have a single emitter extension based on the coda-hale/dropwizard framework which in turn has support for all the above-mentioned endpoints. In particular, we don't know the statsd library used in this extension and would have preferred the dropwizard lib, but I guess that's mostly personal preference.\n- one colleague expressed concern about the use of an unbounded queue for the store-forwarding of metrics and thought it more safe to have a bounded queue, preferring loss of metrics over potential build-ups in memory. We didn't investigate this thouroughly enough at this point to have a definite answer on whether the current code is actually vulnerable towards the scenario described.\n- we added in support for forwarding alerts to a different emitter in the same way as is the case with the graphite emitter.\n- with statsd, every metrics needs to be mapped to a metric type (timer/gauge/counter). We are not sure whether this mapping is correct. If a metric that is not meant to be a counter is declared as such, the values ending up in dashboards will depend in their magnitude on the emission period configured in Druid. Verifying whether these mappings make sense is difficult because it is a lot of work and requires an exact understanding of the semantic of the metrics in Druid itself. Its an implementation detail of each metric emitted by Druid whether it's designed to work as a counter or gauge.\n- a statsd/graphite pipeline would hack the metric path into folders any time it encounters a dot or colon character. The host names of druid nodes therefore get hacked up in sub domain, domain and port path elements which is undesirable, so we replaced those tokens with underscored within the host dimension.\n- the class StatsD-Emitter logs away an error-level log entry reporting a missing metric-type mapping. This is misleading as the code-path of that log message is is hit for all events that are missing a configuration altogether, which would be the case if someone wants to purposefully exclude a metric from being emitted. Therefore we moved this message into the default clause of the switch statement and degraded the log level to \"debug\". In place of the existing log statement, we have another debug-level log-event reporting that a given metric is missing from the configuration and is being swallowed. \n\nSomewhat off-topic for the scope of this pull request but related to our testing:\n- we discovered that there are metrics emitted by Druid which are not part of the documentation. Some such metrics pertain to name-space lookups, others to system-level TCP metrics.\n- how Druid handles metric emission internally is somewhat unclear to us. We so far focussed on getting metrics for historicals, brokers, cache, jvm and system working and see them pass through the statsd-emitter. Metrics that are not associated with a Monitor in Druid are missing and therefore we will at this point only be able to focus on improving on the metrics mapping for those metrics that are covered by monitors\n- the extensions are part of the Druid code-base but are not being bundled into deployable units, so every user will have to build their custom druid distribution and take care of bundling in the dependent libraries. At least this is our current understanding.\n- when using the sigar library to get the system-level metrics in, we could so far only get these systems level metrics emitted in a local setup. We also have a docker based druid cluster in which the system metric emission fails due to an exception in sigar. We haven't had the time to look into this and will also exclude this batch of metrics from further scrutiny as our production setup will use collectd for most systems metrics. But its somewhat sad that so many metrics fall away.\n- we are missing a good metric for depicting how many sequential scans a query takes. \n  Sorry for the long post and the off-topic stuff, but I meant to include purposefully to describe what we struggled with in order to state which parts of the contribution we cannot help testing.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/215672106/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/215673278","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/2410#issuecomment-215673278","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2410","id":215673278,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNTY3MzI3OA==","user":{"login":"sascha-coenen","id":1635350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzUzNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1635350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sascha-coenen","html_url":"https://github.com/sascha-coenen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sascha-coenen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sascha-coenen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sascha-coenen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sascha-coenen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sascha-coenen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sascha-coenen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sascha-coenen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sascha-coenen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sascha-coenen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-29T09:53:30Z","updated_at":"2016-04-29T09:53:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"one more: it would be nice to have a counter metric for the alert-typed metrics.
