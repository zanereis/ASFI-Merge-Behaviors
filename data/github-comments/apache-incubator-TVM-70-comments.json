a project with this level of complexity needs a continuously engaged engineering team\r\n\r\nI think that's already what we have! Even without incubation and a community-based dev team, TVM is already a significant way towards not only fast ML on the usual devices, but also heretofore unexplored ones with VTA. Indeed, TVM's development closely parallels that of MXNet, which continues to thrive, and actually drops some of the procedural/tooling baggage that can hinder contribution.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, although there are certainly success stories of paid core devs (e.g., Neovim), keeping the project maintained exclusively by the community aligns its goals with both the ASF and those same people who use it.\r\n\r\nOf course, one unique aspect of TVM is that its stakeholders come from both industry _and_ academia. Very often, too, contributors represent both interests (e.g., those at industry research labs). (And, personally, I'd be _more_ reassured by an army of capable grad students spending their 25 hour days hacking on TVM :). Overall, I think that there's no worry that the TVM codebase would grow anything but more cohesive.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/452784998/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/452786342","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2216#issuecomment-452786342","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2216","id":452786342,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1Mjc4NjM0Mg==","user":{"login":"srkreddy1238","id":14215163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjE1MTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14215163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238","html_url":"https://github.com/srkreddy1238","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-09T17:44:13Z","updated_at":"2019-01-09T17:44:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jroesch \r\nConcatenate issue persists still.

here, like @sscdotopen from the ASF. Allow me to address a couple of the questions raised so far. I realize that some of what I say is repetitive with the comments made by others, but maybe the different formulation from a different perspective is useful.\r\n\r\n@jroesch said:\r\n> My only concerns are about development workflow/methodology, i.e staying on Github, and avoiding JIRA.\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of the workflow of TVM seems unaffected by a move to the ASF. The biggest challenge usually is to move to a everything-documented workflow where ideas are discussed and decisions are made in a public, archived form. TVM already does this on GitHub and its mailing list.\r\n\r\nThere is a minor adjustment I see coming, though: Discussions will move to an ASF mailing list, and discussions on GitHub will have to be mirrored there. This \"everything (also) happens on the ASF list\" requirement allows the foundation to provide its various legal and other shields for projects.\r\n\r\n@Ravenwater said:\r\n> what are the success statistics for Apache projects that have University-paid versus Company-paid principals? I am worried that a project with this level of complexity needs a continuously engaged engineering team of significant cost and skill level to keep the core healthy.\r\n\r\nNot sure whether such stats are kept :-(. However, a couple of high-profile projects were started at universities, and the move to the ASF was at least not a hindrance to their success. In fact, I believe that the move to the ASF massively contributed to their success, as contributions from industry became substantially easier, and less lawyer-heavy. Apache Spark and Apache Flink are good examples in this category.\r\n\r\nBut your question raises another important concern the ASF actually cares a great deal about: Is the project dependent upon the benevolence of a single entity or not? For a project to be stable in the long term, it has to be as diverse in its support as possible. That is why one major goal during incubation and on the way to graduation to become a top level project is to broaden this support. And having a mixture of members from both industry and academia is beneficial for the stability here.\r\n\r\n@ZihengJiang said:\r\n> One thing is, will Apache require us to transition the website/CI hosting?\r\n\r\nYes and no :). The ASF will own the trademarks to the project name, e.g. \"Apache TVM\". As such, the domain registration(s) of the project, the twitter handle, … and other uses of this trademark need to be under ASF control. This is usually done by sharing custody of those within the PMC.\r\n\r\nThe ASF does provide CI, but I found it often inferior to what other companies offer to OSS projects for free (Shameless plug: Azure DevOps Pipelines :-) ). There is no requirement to use the ASF infrastructure. Just like with domain names and hosting, the important thing is that access and ownership lies with the project. For instance, a private build server at UW being a critical part of the workflow would be problematic (but not a blocker, Spark has done this in the past).\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/453080840/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/453205478","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2302#issuecomment-453205478","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2302","id":453205478,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MzIwNTQ3OA==","user":{"login":"Huyuwei","id":17470319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDcwMzE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17470319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei","html_url":"https://github.com/Huyuwei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-10T18:37:40Z","updated_at":"2019-01-10T18:37:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@zhreshold Should we put the tests under https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/tree/master/tests/python/frontend, and add it to CI https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/master/tests/scripts/task_python_frontend.sh/#L30-L34?

One thing that Apache is quite strict about is the dev@ mail-list(aka. everything (also) happens on the ASF list), this helps to provide a legal shield to the discussion. Given that our current way of development requires major design decisions and discussions being made in Github issues, we will likely resolve the issue by mirroring Github issues into dev@.\r\n\r\nI think one thing that we want to discuss is if we can keep the discourse forum https://discuss.tvm.ai/. While Apache projects are mail-list heavy, many users of the projects and developers find it easy to make use of discourse forums. And this approach has been adopted by communities like Rust, Pytorch, Julia. The discuss forum has become a crucial place to enable vibrate community discussions.  Given that discourse is used for technical discussions and general support, and the content is publically available to the community, I feel that it is possible for ASF to agree on keeping it as long as it is moderated by PMCs, but maybe @markusweimer @sscdotopen  can confirm this as well. Note that major design decisions, which will appear as RFCs(issues), get mirrored into dev@.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/453206427/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/453213273","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2302#issuecomment-453213273","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2302","id":453213273,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MzIxMzI3Mw==","user":{"login":"zhreshold","id":3307514,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDc1MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3307514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold","html_url":"https://github.com/zhreshold","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-10T19:00:50Z","updated_at":"2019-01-10T19:00:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@Huyuwei Seems like there is `tests/python/frontend` and `tests/python/relay/frontend` both including mxnet and keras frontend already, can you clarify the relationship between them?
