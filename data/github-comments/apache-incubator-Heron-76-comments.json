But I notice that you are not downloading directly from `repo1.maven.org`. So you're `wget` command may be working, but I assume it's because you have something else configured beyond what is shown in the text. Perhaps you are setting `HTTP_PROXY` type environment variables? How is your `wget` resolving to `62.244.109.33:8080`? I suspect the issue is that the build script that is failing is still not able to resolve the `repo1.maven.org` host. So we need to figure out how best to configure that part of the build process.\r\n\r\nTo give some extra context, this is not a build script we directly control. When the Zookeeper source package is downloaded, this is a dependency download step that is executed during the Zookeeper build. I can look into what tool is being used to download the `ivy-2.5.0-rc1.jar` and how we can configure it to use the proxy.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/790655212/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/790658668","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/issues/3679#issuecomment-790658668","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/3679","id":790658668,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc5MDY1ODY2OA==","user":{"login":"nicknezis","id":181930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTkzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/181930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis","html_url":"https://github.com/nicknezis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-04T14:30:41Z","updated_at":"2021-03-04T14:31:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Here are some suggestions for how to configure Ant to use your proxy. \r\n\r\nhttps://ant.apache.org/manual/proxy.html\r\n\r\nMaybe `ANT_ARGS` can be used to use `autoproxy` if your proxy is configured at the system level?\r\n\r\nOr you can do this: `export ANT_OPTS=\"-Dhttp.proxyHost=62.244.109.33 -Dhttp.proxyPort=8080\"`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/790658668/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/790982793","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/issues/3600#issuecomment-790982793","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/3600","id":790982793,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc5MDk4Mjc5Mw==","user":{"login":"nicknezis","id":181930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTkzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/181930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis","html_url":"https://github.com/nicknezis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-04T22:14:59Z","updated_at":"2021-03-04T22:14:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@hrsgn Were you able to resolve your issue?
