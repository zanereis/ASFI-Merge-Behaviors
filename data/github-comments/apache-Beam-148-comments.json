The whole\n> point of the Context design pattern is to add and change parameters\n> without the user having to adjust their class, while the same user code\n> would be executed.\n>\n> But that's the opposite of what we want - if you ignore any provided piece\n> of info, you are likely to be clobbering other data. We actually want any\n> new or changed parameters to be a new code path that is unsupported until\n> the user gets around to implementing it.\n>\n> So the API for right now should reflect these properties:\n>\n>    - there are just two cases\n>    - in both cases you really need to use all the information\n>    - you should know at construction time whether the policy supports the\n>    case you need\n>\n> Something like:\n>\n> abstract class FileNamePolicy implements Serializable {\n>\n>   abstract String filenameForGlobalData(int shardNum, int numShards);\n>\n>   String filenameForWindowedData(\n>       int shardNum, int numShards, BoundedWindow w, PaneInfo paneInfo) {\n>     throw new UnsupportedOperationException(\n>         \"This filename policy cannot be used with windowed input\");\n>   }\n>\n>   // And maybe this\n>   abstract boolean verifySupportsWindowedOutput;\n> }\n>\n> This could conceivably be factored into some base classes named for what\n> they support, or even separate abstract classes, either of which could be\n> provided to FileBasedSink, to make the distinction easy to detect.\n>\n> It would be best to actually detect whether it supports windowing or not,\n> but I don't know if we have the bandwidth to get something together along\n> those lines.\n>\n> —\n> You are receiving this because you commented.\n> Reply to this email directly,
