I'm too fast, but was curious so I had a first look at the feature. Some questions / remarks:\n\nThe quota icon is the only one in color and doesn't really fit the rest. Is that done on purpose (color/bigger)?\n\n<img width=\"257\" alt=\"screen shot 2015-12-02 at 22 52 43\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1630096/11545626/88f626b4-9948-11e5-9ab1-483d5d329938.png\">\n\nGlobal setting `quota.enable.service` is `false` by default, but then it does display in the menu. One assumes it works, but you get errors like this:\n\n<img width=\"564\" alt=\"screen shot 2015-12-02 at 22 53 10\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1630096/11545666/d3db8e9e-9948-11e5-8297-57910d1b6c15.png\">\n\nFlipping the setting to `true` makes this error go away. Maybe it is better to not display anything when the global setting is false? Or at least make clear it is not supposed to work.\n\nSetting `quota.currency.symbol` defaults to `R`. Is that a sane default?\n\nNow that the plugin is enabled I get some SQL errors so I probably miss some tables or such. I built a new environment from this branch. Tomorrow I'll investigate and read some more documentation on what I should to do set this up.\n\nNice feature, looking forward to try the rest! :-)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/161449429/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/161451821","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/768#issuecomment-161451821","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/768","id":161451821,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MTQ1MTgyMQ==","user":{"login":"remibergsma","id":1630096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzAwOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1630096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma","html_url":"https://github.com/remibergsma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-02T22:18:30Z","updated_at":"2015-12-02T22:18:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bhaisaab The SQL changes required are implemented in `schema-461to470.sql`.

looking at the rpm spec options using +%config(noreplace) will cause a new version of cloudstack-catalina (cloudstack-catalina.rpmnew) to be created if cloudstack-catalina has been edited.\nHowever as
