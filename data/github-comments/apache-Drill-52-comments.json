After that the failing test will pass. \r\nAlso the `outputIndex` check in `allocateVectors` is there to handle a special case of left join. I have added comments to explain the scenario.\r\nWith all above changes there were few `HashJoin Tests `which were failing because of a bug and I have addressed that too in my commit.\r\nPlease see all set of changes here: https://github.com/Ben-Zvi/drill/pull/9 . You can add that commit in your PR.

(The code uses a setInt() accessor for all these types. No checking is done to maximize performance.)\r\n* When converting from long to int, an exception is thrown for overflow. (The \"natural\" method for an int is setInt(), so the setLong() uses the Java Math.toExactInt() method which throws an exception for overflow.)\r\n* When converting from double to BigInt, follows the Java convention of converting to the closest available value.\r\n* When converting from double to other integral types, first follows the double-to-BigInt rules, then the long-to-int rule.\r\n\r\nThese are the simplest, fastest conversions based on the idea that data should be correct for the target type. We can tinker with the overflow logic over time without affecting the \"happy path\" for correct values.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/473618300/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/473664869","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1635#issuecomment-473664869","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1635","id":473664869,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MzY2NDg2OQ==","user":{"login":"cgivre","id":5513150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTMxNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5513150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre","html_url":"https://github.com/cgivre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-17T13:16:17Z","updated_at":"2019-03-17T13:16:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@KazydubB Commits squashed.

The main idea is to extract all try-catches from _**load(int rowIndex, String value)**_ methods of each concrete **ColumnDefn** implementation and make one unified ```try-cacth``` which will wrap whole loop used for reading and handling of each line in log file for the reader (the while loop inside ```next()```). Such approach will reduce boilerplate code and expected that it'll work faster, because try-catch will be initiated once per row batch instead of each column of each line (row). Note that it's not requirement for this pull request, but rather suggestion for future improvement.
