But without this support (or a reliable way to escape strings from at least Java code), I'm not comfortable doing so for anything that needs user-controlled substitution...\r\n\r\nApologies for the delays getting this finished, I do still plan on completing this, because I agree that it is really important. I was holding off on updating this branch until #8566 went in to avoid any conflicts between upgrading the calcite version and anything going on in this PR, but haven't had a chance to get back to it since then. I hopefully should have some time soon, maybe we can get this merged before it's birthday 🍰 \r\n\r\n>One note: given that parameters are specified in a list, could it be legal to leave out all ordinals and have them default to their 1-based list index if they are all missing?\r\n\r\nI'll see what I can do when I update the PR to fix conflicts.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/568583960/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/568586510","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/6043#issuecomment-568586510","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6043","id":568586510,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2ODU4NjUxMA==","user":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-23T21:31:23Z","updated_at":"2019-12-23T21:31:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue has been marked as stale due to 280 days of inactivity.

Only manually release these physical resources, you can refer to the following script for resource monitoring and release:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n# /bin/bash\r\n\r\nDRUID_RUNNING_TASKS_PIDS=`ps -ef f|grep '\\_ java -cp conf/druid/_common:conf/druid/middleManager:lib'|grep -v grep|awk '{print $2}'`\r\n\r\nCURRENT_TIMESTAMP=`date +%s`\r\n\r\nfor pid in $DRUID_RUNNING_TASKS_PIDS\r\ndo\r\n    CUEERNT_START_TIME=`ps -p $pid -o lstart|tail -1`\r\n    TEMP=`date -d \"$CUEERNT_START_TIME\" +%s`\r\n    TIME_DIFF=$(($CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - $TEMP))\r\n    if [[ $TIME_DIFF -gt 3600 ]]; then\r\n       echo 'current PID $pid,start time $CUEERNT_START_TIME, timestamp$TEMP'\r\n       kill -9 $pid\r\n    fi\r\ndone\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease modify the 3600 in the script that is longer than the time to deploy the task. In order to ensure the data service, try to double the time of task. Add the script monitoring into the crontab of the system, for example:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n*/5 * * * * /bin/sh /hadoop/data1/druid-0.12.3/druid-task-monitor.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\nMine is a check every 5 minutes to free up resources","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/570538079/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/570641257","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/9118#issuecomment-570641257","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/9118","id":570641257,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MDY0MTI1Nw==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-03T17:32:22Z","updated_at":"2020-01-03T17:32:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've backported #9120 to 0.17.0, merged that branch here, and re-pushed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/570641257/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/570666851","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/9122#issuecomment-570666851","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/9122","id":570666851,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MDY2Njg1MQ==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-03T19:04:39Z","updated_at":"2020-01-03T19:04:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@himanshug would you be able to comment on this part?

Because the \"LATEST\" Kinesis shard iterator only provides access to the seq no after the most recent record (and there is no mode to get the latest readable record), the \"get latest offset\" operation in Kinesis runs in a polling loop. When data is not being continuously written to a shard, this can result in a Kinesis supervisor making extremely slow progress as it waits for the polling loop to timeout for each shard that has no recent data. Removing the latest offset check restricts this problem situation to only when a Kinesis supervisor first discovers a shard that's empty (after data is written to that shard once, the earliest seq no check can return immediately)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/571349266/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/571354816","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/9133#issuecomment-571354816","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/9133","id":571354816,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MTM1NDgxNg==","user":{"login":"amishasthana","id":10508070,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTA4MDcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10508070?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amishasthana","html_url":"https://github.com/amishasthana","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amishasthana/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amishasthana/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amishasthana/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amishasthana/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amishasthana/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amishasthana/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amishasthana/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amishasthana/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amishasthana/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-06T23:05:27Z","updated_at":"2020-01-06T23:05:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Continuously pumping data in stream.

IMO it isn't worth unit testing every single class, and can even be counter-productive (adds to the amount of work it takes to refactor things later). So I like the idea of pairing functional tests with coverage checks.\r\n\r\nThat being said, some of the examples you pointed out would be good to add unit tests for, so I'll go through and add a few more. I probably won't have a chance to do this today, but I'll try to get to it soon.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/573164062/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/573192938","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/7231#issuecomment-573192938","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7231","id":573192938,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MzE5MjkzOA==","user":{"login":"leventov","id":609240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwOTI0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/609240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov","html_url":"https://github.com/leventov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-10T20:27:49Z","updated_at":"2020-01-10T20:27:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The industry term for this idea appears to be \"request coalescing\" or \"collapsing\" (posting so that somebody could find this issue via search).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/573192938/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
