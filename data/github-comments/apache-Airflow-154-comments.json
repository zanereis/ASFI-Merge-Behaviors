I sorta conflated 2 issues here.  Here's what's happening.\r\n\r\n1\\. When building the docs site locally, if I do a fresh install and try to build without `mock` in the `docs` extra.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ SLUGIFY_USES_TEXT_UNIDECODE=yes pip install -e .[doc]\r\n$ cd docs/\r\n$ ./build.sh\r\nsphinx-build -b html -d _build/doctrees   . _build/html\r\nRunning Sphinx v1.7.6\r\n\r\nConfiguration error:\r\nThere is a programable error in your configuration file:\r\n\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/Users/taylor/.local/share/virtualenvs/tmp-afb06f74a17a352/lib/python3.6/site-packages/sphinx/config.py\", line 161, in __init__\r\n    execfile_(filename, config)\r\n  File \"/Users/taylor/.local/share/virtualenvs/tmp-afb06f74a17a352/lib/python3.6/site-packages/sphinx/util/pycompat.py\", line 150, in execfile_\r\n    exec_(code, _globals)\r\n  File \"conf.py\", line 16, in <module>\r\n    import mock\r\nModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mock'\r\n\r\nmake: *** [html] Error 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis happens because conf.py for Sphinx [imports mock on line 16](https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/blob/1b4961a0c5ebf5e314130a3fc97fb06fcb7c0c1a/docs/conf.py#L16) which it uses to build `MOCK_MODULES`.  That appears to be [a Sphinx pattern for a build system not having some module dependencies](http://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#i-get-import-errors-on-libraries-that-depend-on-c-modules), which given the modules in that list, makes sense to me in a limited environment where I'm not doing a big install with more extras.  Adding the mock change that's in this PR resolves that issue.\r\n\r\n2\\. The CI issue fix... so if I try to replicate the 4 extras that I believe RTD is installing per .readthedocs.yml, with `mock` removed from the `docs` extra, then run the build script which effectively runs `make html` which effectively runs `sphinx-build -b html . _build/html`, I get the same error.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ READTHEDOCS=True pip install -e .[doc,docker,gcp_api,emr]\r\n$ cd docs/\r\n$ ./build.sh\r\n...same error as above...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis makes me think there might be something wonky with RTD.  Perhaps it's running a different command than `make html`, or somehow is getting other extras installed that include mock (e.g., any of the extras that build on `devel` in setup.py).  As far as I can tell [from the RTD docs](http://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/builds.html#understanding-what-s-going-on) they are running the same command that errors out for me outside of their environment when I don't supply the mock dependency.\r\n\r\n> When we build your documentation, we run sphinx-build -b html . _build/html, where html would be replaced with the correct backend. \r\n\r\nI'm all for getting to the bottom of the mock issue, but I also know that getting the docs site updating again is probably more urgent.  If not having mock doesn't seem to affect RTD, I'm happy to remove it here.\r\n\r\n**So the mock issue is really a completely separate issue from the GPL RTD issue.  Should I separate it from this PR?  Or keep it here and add a comment?  What do you think?**\r\n\r\nP.S. I also fixed some trailing whitespace in .readthedocs.yml.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/410836135/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/410836839","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3504#issuecomment-410836839","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3504","id":410836839,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMDgzNjgzOQ==","user":{"login":"cnidus","id":5855255,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NTUyNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5855255?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnidus","html_url":"https://github.com/cnidus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnidus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnidus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnidus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnidus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnidus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnidus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnidus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnidus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnidus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-06T20:07:36Z","updated_at":"2018-08-06T20:07:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@OElesin I'm also really interested in this submission.

The issue was in my understanding how sqlalchemy was dealing with timezone information inside fields for mysql. If you insert in mysql `2018-08-08 20:40:21.443732+02:00` mysql will ignore the `+02:00` _and_ apply the connection's timezone setting (e.g. `set time_zone='+01:00'`). I thought sqlalchemy would handle this somehow (ie bij separating the timezone and doing something like this [1]. \r\n\r\nSo, this creates chaos obviously, although not too much as long as you do not change the connection's timezone. In my tests I was actually doing so hence they didn't pass. Strangely enough if executing them isolated / locally it worked for some reason. probably due to connection re-use. \r\n\r\nAnyways I borrowed you event watcher and now make sure we always connect in UTC with mysql. For postgres it doesn't matter and we can test it doesn't. \r\n\r\n[1] https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7651409/mysql-datetime-insert-a-date-with-timezone-offset","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/411195033/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/411195448","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3708#issuecomment-411195448","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3708","id":411195448,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMTE5NTQ0OA==","user":{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-07T20:42:44Z","updated_at":"2018-08-07T20:42:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"AIP-3: Drop support for Mysql :D\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/411195448/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/411195878","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3708#issuecomment-411195878","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3708","id":411195878,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMTE5NTg3OA==","user":{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-07T20:44:02Z","updated_at":"2018-08-07T20:44:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think our google friends use mysql 5.7 for their cloud composer.
