Hi @komawei ,\r\n> Sorry for late reply, the `ModuloShardingTableAlgorithm` and `ModuloShardingDatabaseAlgorithm` is an example custom sharding algorithm in [apache/incubator-shardingsphere-example](https://github.com/apache/incubator-shardingsphere-example)\r\n> \r\n> And in 4.0.X example project, they have been subdivided into `precise` and `range`.\r\n> \r\n> I suggest you clone example project and try to run example first.\r\n\r\nHi, I've customized my own sharding algorithm. What I want to point out are the errors on the example page. Maybe it's easier and more friendly to somone who begins to learn

understand what you mean wrong. This is a beautiful misunderstanding. JMH is just a quantifiable data report to reflect your code's performance. It is mainly used for our general core logic optimization code (basic code or algorithm level), and we usually use the Test package to indicate the accuracy of your code. The focus of the two is different.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/514893537/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/514896088","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/pull/2758#issuecomment-514896088","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/2758","id":514896088,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNDg5NjA4OA==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-25T04:57:38Z","updated_at":"2019-07-25T04:57:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"##
