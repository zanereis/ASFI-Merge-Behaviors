As part of code review, please provide your opinion on whether the provided unit tests are adequate, or what additional test cases should be added.\r\n\r\nManual end-to-end testing, if you are so moved, consists of six scenarios for a given sensor queue:\r\n1. Under **heavy continuous load** the batchSize still controls flushing behavior, because the queue size always exceeds batchSize before queue age exceeds batchTimeout.\r\n2. Under **light continuous load**, where each queue continues to receive at least one message per second, and batchSize is large enough it is never exceeded, then the batchTimeout for each queue should control flushing behavior within +/- 1 sec, because each new message triggers a check of the queue age and potential timeout flush.\r\n  - NOTE: If the configured batchTimeout is set to a large number, bigger than `1/2 topology.message.timeout.secs - 1` (which equals **14 sec** by default), then it will be replaced by an effective value equal to `1/2 topology.message.timeout.secs - 1`.  Flushing will occur within +/- 1 sec of each _effective_ batchTimeout interval, rather than the _configured_ batchTimeout interval.\r\n3. Under **light intermittent load**, where less than batchSize messages queue up, and gaps between messages may exceed the timeout interval, then age checks and potential flush events may be triggered by _either_ incoming messages or TickTuple events, depending on the phase relationship between intermittent bursts of messages, and the TickTuple system tick.  The TickTuple interval is guaranteed to be < `1/2 topology.message.timeout.secs`, hence the default TickTuple interval is 14 seconds.  But if the smallest batchTimeout configured for any sensor queue on the Bolt is < the default TickTuple interval, then that smallest value becomes the actual TickTuple interval.  This produces three sub-cases, all of which guarantee a flush event before any message gets recycled due to aging past `topology.message.timeout.secs`:\r\n  - If the queue's configured batchTimeout is the smallest (or only) such on this Bolt, and that number is smaller than the default TickTuple interval, then it _becomes_ the actual TickTuple interval.  The queue is guaranteed to flush between 1x and 2x this interval.\r\n  - If the queue's configured batchTimeout is not the smallest such, but still is < the default TickTuple interval, then the queue is guaranteed to flush between its own `configured batchTimeout` and its `configured batchTimeout + actual TickTuple interval` (which is less than 2x its own `configured batchTimeout`).\r\n  - If the queue's configured batchTimeout is > the default TickTuple interval (14 sec default), then its effective batchTimeout is set to the default TickTuple interval.  The queue is guaranteed to flush between this `effective batchTimeout` and its `effective batchTimeout + actual TickTuple interval`.\r\n\r\nThe upshot is that:\r\n* \"Configured batchTimeout\" should be thought of as \"minimum age before you'll allow a time-based flush\" (capped by default TickTuple interval, aka 1/2 `topology.message.timeout.secs`)\r\n* \"Actual TickTuple interval\" is the \"maximum time between age checks\".  It will be <= all the configured batchTimeouts for the various sensors on the Bolt.\r\n* When a flush actually happens may be up to \"effective batchTimeout\" + \"actual TickTuple interval\", depending on exactly when intermittent message events and periodic Tick events happen.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/314900342/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/314909075","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/481#issuecomment-314909075","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/481","id":314909075,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNDkwOTA3NQ==","user":{"login":"mattf-apache","id":908957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwODk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/908957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache","html_url":"https://github.com/mattf-apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-12T21:56:29Z","updated_at":"2017-07-12T21:56:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@ottobackwards , thanks for looking at this.

for submitting this, and thanks for being patient.

I'm also just generally unsure if this is the right place to even handle this function.  It hardly seems like it's useful for anything outside of Fireeye, given the formatting (but I don't know that we want to fix that here).

Every time a Profiler is configured, started, or stopped, make one entry in the audit log.  The idea is to be able to answer exactly the kinds of questions posed in METRON-450, so the records should include things like the configuration, the first and last timestamps, and perhaps the key builder parameters.  This would prevent historical profiles from being \"lost\" because the would-be querier doesn't have access to the exact config parameters used to write the profile.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of housekeeping, one might do a scan, daily and/or at system restart, to assure that (a) the set Profiles with a \"start\" but not an \"end\" recorded in the audit log, and (b) the set of currently running Profiles, are actually consistent, and record \"inferred end\" entries in the audit log for orphans found.\r\n\r\nThis solution is somewhat backward-applicable to existing Profile data; I think there are brute-force ways to scan the existing HBase tables and infer audit log entries, especially if historical configuration data is still available.  We could write such a scanner.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/315434241/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/315447165","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/647#issuecomment-315447165","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/647","id":315447165,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNTQ0NzE2NQ==","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-14T19:28:48Z","updated_at":"2017-07-14T19:28:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"- I removed `-ksp` from Enrichment and Indexing.\r\n- I added `-e` also to the Parsers.

If we are to have a decodable row key, then something like this would be necessary.  The point of my comments on this is to shift to a top-down perspective:\r\n- The requirements you're trying to address are, I think, to be able to query metadata about existing Profiles, for multiple reasons including to not have old Profiles become inaccessible due to loss of metadata needed for Profile queries.\r\n- I think a ToC is a better way to do that than a decodable rowkey.  It localizes the metadata instead of having to do a full scan and reason about all the rowkeys for every metadata query.  I proposed the Profile audit log as a very simple way to implement a ToC, and thanks for saying that better than I did.\r\n- I'm not against doing a _more_ decodable row key, it just in my mind is not the simplest nor best solution to the evident requirement.  But it does constitute an architectural improvement.\r\n- As I briefly mentioned, I don't think our current row key is totally opaque, it just needs a brute-force approach to figure out.  Not suitable for interactive queries, but would be acceptable for a one-time pass to build (or re-build) the ToC.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/315562210/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/315762760","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/359#issuecomment-315762760","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/359","id":315762760,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNTc2Mjc2MA==","user":{"login":"merrimanr","id":311928,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTkyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/311928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr","html_url":"https://github.com/merrimanr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-17T13:55:44Z","updated_at":"2017-07-17T13:55:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@DomenicPuzio, this has been resolved by https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/603.

That's generally frowned upon for mock tests that use verify() because expectations for the number of invocations is part of the api. A better alternative is to pull that mock out into an @Before. I rather like the idiom I've taken here best:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class PcapCliTest {\r\n\r\n  @Mock\r\n  private PcapJob jobRunner;\r\n  @Mock\r\n  private ResultsWriter resultsWriter;\r\n  @Mock\r\n  private Clock clock;\r\n\r\n  @Before\r\n  public void setup() {\r\n    MockitoAnnotations.initMocks(this);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt keeps the setup lean and requires less boilerplate code (well, when you have multiple mocks, at least). Also, this approach will re-instantiate a new mock for every test, which I think is what we want in this case.

Relative links need to be re-written.  ... \r\nas best we can we will re-write named anchors referring to tags autogenerated from headers.            \r\nThe problem with generated tags is that Github-MD forces header text to lower-case, and                \r\nreplaces blank spaces with hyphens, while doxia-markdown leaves case unchanged, and replaces           \r\nblanks with underscores.  Fortunately we seem to have a culture of using link references that          \r\nare typographically the same as the header text, so we have some basis for fixing most links.\r\n```\r\nYou've done several links to doc headers (which have autogenerated anchor tags) that _don't_ use the header text as the link reference text.  That means the tool is unable to re-synthesize the link tags, which will therefore be wrong.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, replace things that look like:\r\n```\r\nBuild the Metron RPMs by [following these instructions](../../metron-deployment#rpm).\r\n```\r\nwith something like this:\r\n```\r\nBuild the Metron RPMs by following these instructions: [RPM](../../metron-deployment#rpm).\r\n```\r\nThis will cause the link in Doxia to be correctly re-written as `../../metron-deployment#RPM`\r\n\r\nIf this seems stilted you could go back and retitle the section you're pointing at to be something like `Building RPMs`, then the above reference becomes:\r\n```\r\nCreate the Metron RPMs by following these instructions: [Building RPMs](../../metron-deployment#building-rpms)\r\nor\r\nCreate the Metron RPMs by following the instructions for [Building RPMs](../../metron-deployment#building-rpms)\r\n```\r\nwhich will also be correctly fixed-up by the re-write script.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/316504218/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/316564850","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/636#issuecomment-316564850","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/636","id":316564850,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNjU2NDg1MA==","user":{"login":"ottobackwards","id":1111551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTE1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards","html_url":"https://github.com/ottobackwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-20T00:53:02Z","updated_at":"2017-07-20T00:53:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 - great job","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/316564850/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/316697291","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/656#issuecomment-316697291","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/656","id":316697291,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNjY5NzI5MQ==","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-20T13:07:38Z","updated_at":"2017-07-20T13:12:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @mattf-horton .
