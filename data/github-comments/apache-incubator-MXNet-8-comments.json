I'm currently doing some refactoring to simplify the Julia side IO interface. I will try to push changes for the the Python side maybe next week if nobody has come up with a better idea by then.

It is kind of inconvenient to have two symbols for training and predicting simply because one is with a loss layer and the other is without.\n\nOne possible way to go around this is to distinguish the `loss` from the `output`, so\n- A network could have a output symbol, that could be the softmax, as usual, and that is the symbol of the network.\n- A network could have one or more loss attached it, but the loss is **not** the output node. We will provide an API to collect all the losses (just a couple of real numbers) from the network after one forward pass is run.\n\nSomething like this\n\n``` python\nnet = Variable(\"data\")\nnet = FullyConnected(data=net, num_hidden=100)\nnet = Softmax(data=net)\nnet.attach_loss(MulticlassLogisticLoss())\n```\n\nand multiple loss\n\n``` python\ndata = Variable(\"data\")\nfc1 = FullyConnected(data=data, name=\"fc1\", num_hidden=100)\nnet = Softmax(data=fc1, name=\"smax1\")\nnet2 = FullyConnected(data=fc1, name=\"fc2\", num_hidden=100)\nnet2 = Softmax(data=net2, name=\"smax2\")\nnet.attach_loss(MulticlassLogisticLoss())\nnet2.attach_loss(MulticlassLogisticLoss())\n\nnet_comb = Group(net, net2)\nnet_comb.list_outputs() # => ['smax1_output', 'smax2_output']\n```\n\nFor the loss function, we have two choices\n- Make a switch to distinguish `training` and `prediction`, during `prediction`, the forward pass will skip computing the loss functions because no label is presented.\n- Completely ignore the loss functions during `forward` (that is also the current behavior) because the objective function values are not really needed during back propagation. While this is simpler and more efficient, I have a weak argument that I want to make against this design: sometimes it is useful to allow the users to observe the objective function. It is especially useful for debugging. And if people are working on new optimization algorithms, the objective function value (instead of the accuracy) is the direct things to look at.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/152276177/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/152282425","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/427#issuecomment-152282425","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/427","id":152282425,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MjI4MjQyNQ==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-29T18:41:58Z","updated_at":"2015-10-29T18:41:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Guess

`Softmax`+`MulticlassLogisticLoss`)\n  - `SoftmaxOutput` as only doing the softmax, without a loss functionality, so cannot backpropagate unless a loss is attached to it.\n  - `Softmax` as a shortcut
