I guess in this case the best thing is to be careful what kind of data you are storing in the profile to make sure that even if a merge happens no critical data can be retrieved. \r\n\r\nI've been working on a way to \"protect\" properties that would only be accessible if a user is authentified but this is not yet available in Unomi.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you use option 1 you could also not call the merge just to be on the safe side. A merge could happen only when a user is \"truly\" identified.

We have the ability to stream all of the events from beginning time and the relevant consumers should be able to update past events with the new property. This scenario is something we already encountered several times and we build our systems in a way that entities can be updated at their persistent target.\r\nAgain, if there is a way we can achieve this by not changing the core Unomi entities i would be more than happy to hear.\r\nIn the way we architect our system, Unomi is not accessible from the outside (i.e the internet) of our systems, hence we do not have any security considerations.\r\n@sergehuber  What do u mean by secondary id? Should we add a new property to Event and that would act as our id for updating?\r\n@sigdestad I agree with you, Can u elaborate on how would u implement this without breaking event immutability?\r\nLooking forward for your responses,\r\n10x\r\nRon","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/unomi/issues/comments/590799967/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/unomi/issues/comments/591034828","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/unomi/pull/131#issuecomment-591034828","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/unomi/issues/131","id":591034828,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5MTAzNDgyOA==","user":{"login":"lyogev","id":23477645,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNDc3NjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23477645?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyogev","html_url":"https://github.com/lyogev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyogev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyogev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyogev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyogev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyogev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyogev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyogev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyogev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyogev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-25T19:46:28Z","updated_at":"2020-02-25T19:46:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Regarding
