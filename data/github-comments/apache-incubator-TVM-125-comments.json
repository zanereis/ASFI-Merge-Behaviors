fix helps us with numpy ndarray types, but think about it: the solution, duck typing, is interesting that now we assume that we just assume we know it (i mean we just assume `dtype` exists), but it now doesn't help at all in type guessing when we want to distinguish i32 and i64 when a python scalar is given (see Xingjian's example https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/issues/3855#issuecomment-526771142), because now we don't know immediately.\r\n\r\nA general approach when we implement an ordinary compiler is that we just leave it blank and infer it in later passes, for example, let's just implement a unification-based type solver in this level of IR, which, @sxjscience welcome to contribute if you have

code in the PR seems to be very different from ncnn, so I cannot judge if this PR is the best, but it must be much better than the current TVM approach I think.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about the ncnn vulkan backend, feel free to post an issue to

The only tricky part is that `IsOpSupported` and `AreOpsCompatible` may need to change for each op. For example, with `Dense`, we need to make sure that the `units` attribute is empty.\r\n\r\nHow about this: we create a new class, `CombineParallelOpBatch`, that has a default implementation of `IsOpSupported` which returns true, and a default implementation of `AreOpsCompatible` which returns true if the shapes and dtypes of both ops are the same.  From there, we can have `CombineParallelDense` inherit from `CombineParallelOpBatch` and override `IsOpSupported` and `AreOpsCompatible`. The constructor can take the name of the op and the min number of branches to combine. This way, we can easily add new IR passes by adding a line like `CombineParallelOpBatch('add', 3)`.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure it's possible to merge `CombineParallelConv2D` and `CombineParallelDense` because `CombineParallelConv2D` concatenates the inputs rather than stacking.

To me, testing `relay.testing` is sort like a system integrated test which needs to verify end to end running result, leading to `tests/python/relay/benchmarking`. Sadly, the building (`tvm`) and running (`vm`) with mobilenet NHWC layout is too slow (several minutes) for some reason (maybe because we are initializing NHWC support in TOPI).

For example we could also overload how they are combined with another hook, i.e concat vs. stack. \r\n\r\nIf I understand the goal correctly is we have some operators like, `op1(args, attrs)` and `op1(args, attrs)` we should only need to add 3 methods, one to check if `op1` is supported, should be an easy one liner, that the args and attrs match, and how to combine the values, i.e. call stack on a sequence of arguments.

number.

I know your fix works, but it took me a while to understand what problem this PR is supposed to solve. Especially the logic around assigning the parent pointer temporarily and letting LCA fix up when the parent should be null seems tricky.\r\n\r\n```\r\n// find the LCAs of all outputs.\r\nOpPatternKind pattern = kElemWise;\r\nNode* parent = nullptr;\r\nbool init = true;\r\nfor (auto link = gnode->outputs.head; link != nullptr; link= link->next) {\r\n  size_t oindex = link->value.node->index;\r\n  CHECK_LT(oindex, nodes.size());\r\n  Node* onode = nodes[oindex];\r\n  CHECK(onode != nullptr);\r\n  if (init) {\r\n    parent = onode;\r\n    init = false;\r\n  } else {\r\n    parent = LeastCommonAncestor(parent, onode, &pattern);\r\n  }\r\n  pattern = CombinePattern(pattern, link->value.pattern);\r\n}\r\ntnode->depth = parent ? parent->depth + 1 : 1;\r\ntnode->parent = parent;\r\ntnode->pattern = pattern;\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think the part of the problem is assignment of parent pointer is tightly coupled with LCA computation inside a loop. It would be great if we could replace snippet above with something like (using a mix of non c++ syntax):\r\n```\r\nparent, pattern = LeastCommonAncestor(gnode->outputs) // LCA of all output nodes, not just two\r\ntnode->parent = parent;\r\ntnode->depth = parent ? parent->depth + 1 : 1;\r\ntnode->pattern = pattern;\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/528142919/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
