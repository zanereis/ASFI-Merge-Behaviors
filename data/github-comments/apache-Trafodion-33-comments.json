Selva,\nI didn't go with the NULLIFERROR approach at first place because I feel some difficulty and confusing about it, it doesn't looks possible for me instinctively. \nNow, I try to really spend time on this approach, that confusion become more concrete: As far as I understand, a function must have scalar value as operand. In this case, we cannot know the converting result until try to do the real converting first. So how to design the input operand for NULLIFERROR? I cannot figure out how CAST's return value can be used as 'ERROR' and as input to next NULLIFERROR clause.\nFor example: we can generate such an expression:\n   NULLIFERROR( CAST () )\nIf translate into pCode, it will generate two blocks of pCode instructions, first is for CAST, during pCode execution of that block, if it meets converting error, it will return error to the caller immediately and no chance to go to next block of NULLIFERROR. If we modify the CAST pCode to continue and save error conditions somewhere so next NULLIFERROR can get as input, it will have unknown side effort. And it will be difficult to figure out 'what value is ERROR value?' returned by the CAST function. That will be input to NULLIFERROR. We have nullIndicator in a row, but no errorIndicator. So I am confused here. \nSo it needs a lot more details about how to use NULLIFERROR.
