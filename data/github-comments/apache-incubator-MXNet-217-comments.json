I compared the top of tree to the TOT with the commit in questions (a8804a) unapplied, on the following machine:\r\n\r\n- Core i7-5930K CPU @ 3.50GHz (6 cores)\r\n- 32 GB RAM\r\n- Tesla P100 (Pascal)\r\n\r\nWhile I don't see a slowdown, the speed-up is very minor, after the various refactorings done in the process of the code review for this PR. Initially, it was a difference between 20% of the execution time (prior to PR version 1) to 0.5% of the execution time. Unfortunately, since padding cannot be inverted and requires branching, and due to some other changes since the first commit, the gain is now 2% at best.\r\n\r\nThe Sockeye parameters I used were as follows (on WMT15 DE-EN dataset):\r\n\r\n```\r\npython3 -m sockeye.train \\\r\n        --source data/train2.de \\\r\n        --target data/train2.en \\\r\n        --validation-source data/valid2.de \\\r\n        --validation-target data/valid2.en \\\r\n        --output models \\\r\n        --num-words 50000 \\\r\n        --rnn-num-layers 2 \\\r\n        --rnn-num-hidden 512 \\\r\n        --num-embed-source 512 \\\r\n        --num-embed-target 512 \\\r\n        --max-seq-len 50 \\\r\n        --batch-size 64 \\\r\n        --bucket-width 10 \\\r\n        --checkpoint-frequency 20000 \\\r\n        --max-num-checkpoint-not-improved 8 \\\r\n        --dropout 0.3 \\\r\n        --optimizer adam \\\r\n        --clip-gradient 1.0 \\\r\n        --learning-rate-scheduler-type plateau-reduce \\\r\n        --learning-rate-reduce-factor 0.5 \\\r\n        --learning-rate-reduce-num-not-improved 3 \\\r\n        --attention-type dot \\\r\n        --learning-rate-half-life 10 \\\r\n        --monitor-bleu 10000 \\\r\n        --seed 42 \\\r\n        --use-fused-rnn \\\r\n        --device-ids 1 \\\r\n        --max-updates 2000\r\n```\r\n\r\n| MxNet version        | 1k batches           | 2k batches  |\r\n| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|\r\n|  TOT      | 225s | 420s |\r\n| TOT with commit a8804a unapplied       | 221s     | 419s  |\r\n\r\nSo, I can still see a speed-up (on Pascal), but it's much smaller than in the original commit, due to a different design (single MxNet kernel launch (but not single CUDA launch), honoring padding non-reversal as discussed earlier in the ticket, etc.).\r\n\r\nI wonder if there is a different way to improve perf more, e.g. via a raw kernel rather than the magic macros, or if the current implementation is the best it can be from a performance perspective while using things such as MSHADOW_XINLINE. Maybe I'm missing some magic step here that is happening behind the scenes, since it's not an actual CUDA kernel written the traditional way, so maybe I missed some opportunities for perf improvement via these wrappers. In any case, I can't repro the slowdown on my end.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/318766929/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/318769022","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/7242#issuecomment-318769022","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/7242","id":318769022,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxODc2OTAyMg==","user":{"login":"piiswrong","id":568948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODk0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong","html_url":"https://github.com/piiswrong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-28T21:44:54Z","updated_at":"2017-07-28T21:44:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"announcements should be ordered according to time.\r\n\r\nI don't think cheat sheet qualifies for an announcement.
