If you use `Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10)` you are creating 10 different threads to handle events on.  When numerous events fire at close to the same time, you will handle all of those events _concurrently_.  That makes you will observe them simultaneously / concurrently / out of order / in a racy way.  So this is not a TreeCache problem.  If you use a single-threaded executor you should see everything in sequential order.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nScott\r\n ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/353629445/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/354790335","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/curator/pull/242#issuecomment-354790335","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/242","id":354790335,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NDc5MDMzNQ==","user":{"login":"Randgalt","id":264818,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDgxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/264818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Randgalt","html_url":"https://github.com/Randgalt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Randgalt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Randgalt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Randgalt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Randgalt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Randgalt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Randgalt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Randgalt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Randgalt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Randgalt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-02T15:23:49Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T15:23:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@madrob you OK with merging this now?

It can be improved further via removal of the `nodeState` field - its `LIVE` state corresponds exactly to the adjacent `childData` field being non-null, and a sentinel `ChildData` value can be used for the `DEAD` state. This simplification also reduces the room for bugs and state inconsistencies.</p>\n\n<p>    Other improvements included:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>A further simplification to have `TreeNode` extend `AtomicReference`, which obviates the need for an explicit `childData` field</li>\n\t<li>More robust cache update logic (in get-children and get-data event callbacks)</li>\n\t<li>Avoid overhead of incrementing/decrementing the `outstandingOps` atomic integer post-initialization</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>    See corresponding JIRA: <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CURATOR-447\" title=\"TreeCache: Improve memory usage and concurrent update logic\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"CURATOR-447\"><del>CURATOR-447</del></a>(<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CURATOR-447\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CURATOR-447</a>)</p>\n\n<p>You can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:</p>\n\n<p>    $ git pull <a href=\"https://github.com/njhill/curator\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/njhill/curator</a> <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CURATOR-447\" title=\"TreeCache: Improve memory usage and concurrent update logic\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"CURATOR-447\"><del>CURATOR-447</del></a></p>\n\n<p>Alternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/curator/pull/250.patch\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/curator/pull/250.patch</a></p>\n\n<p>To close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch<br/>\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:</p>\n\n<p>    This closes #250</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>commit 1c7be856fb514015286855f1ad9fd89069c32906<br/>\nAuthor: nickhill <nickhill@...><br/>\nDate:   2017-03-26T20:19:40Z</p>\n\n<p>    remove nodeState field, improve thread safety of cache updates</p>\n\n<p>    also simplify by having TreeNode extend AtomicReference<ChildData></p>\n\n<p>commit 67210556919d7f822c431597245c4fa7246901dd<br/>\nAuthor: nickhill <nickhill@...><br/>\nDate:   2017-03-26T20:20:32Z</p>\n\n<p>    avoid incrementing/decrementing outstandingOps post-initialization</p>\n\n<p>    no need to incur the synchronization overhead</p>\n\n<p>commit a5a680d50e50a0a804caa875a53e2ee8d9a268f9<br/>\nAuthor: nickhill <nickhill@...><br/>\nDate:   2018-01-02T16:36:20Z</p>\n\n<p>    remove superfluous braces</p>\n\n<hr />","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604764143/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/355376125","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/curator/pull/208#issuecomment-355376125","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/208","id":355376125,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NTM3NjEyNQ==","user":{"login":"adamdecaf","id":120951,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDk1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/120951?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamdecaf","html_url":"https://github.com/adamdecaf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamdecaf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamdecaf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamdecaf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamdecaf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamdecaf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamdecaf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamdecaf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamdecaf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamdecaf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-04T19:30:32Z","updated_at":"2018-01-04T19:30:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Was this supposed to be backported to the 2.x series?

But it's likely subjective and certainly a minor thing.\r\n\r\nThe `outstandingOps` change seems clearer to me - the field has no use for most of the life of the cache and yet is incremented/decremented on every single change. It's not the CPU cycle overhead but more the (CPU) cache coherency overhead since it's an `AtomicLong`. I didn't think the change introduces any raciness - the only times when `outstandingOps` needs to be modified (during initialization or re-initialization) it will be guaranteed to be non-null.\r\n\r\n> I would expect the memory footprint of `ConcurrentMap<String, TreeNode>` children to mostly dominate the memory overhead of our own classes\r\n\r\nGood point. The description of [CURATOR-374](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CURATOR-374) implied this might have _some_ mem overhead benefit for very large caches, but removal of the `nodeState` field was motivated more by state simplification and consolidation of atomic updates.
