In our internal flink, `InternalStateDescriptor` will be serialized which lead to the `NotSerializableException`, however I can't find the same logic in flink.

As I said before, I don't mind making `SingleElementIterable` `Serializable`. However, we have to ensure that the property also holds. `element: T` is not necessarily serializable so the serialization might fail. We can not easily declare `T` as `Serializable` because that would mean to change the interface of the `AggregateFunction` and enforce serializabiliy on the accumulators.\r\n\r\nI see two options:\r\n- declare the `element` field as `transient` and ensure that the `SingleElementIterable` is only used in a context where it is OK to lose `element` during serialization.\r\n- override the default de/serialization methods and serialize `element` using a `TypeSerializer`.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\nBest, Fabian","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/337850331/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/337850653","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4846#issuecomment-337850653","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4846","id":337850653,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzg1MDY1Mw==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-19T09:21:30Z","updated_at":"2017-10-19T09:21:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @xccui, are you working on this right now? \r\nFLINK-7854 is a blocker for the release and we should try to fix it before end of next week.\r\n\r\nThanks, Fabian","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/337850653/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/337851548","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4846#issuecomment-337851548","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4846","id":337851548,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzg1MTU0OA==","user":{"login":"xccui","id":1452518,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NTI1MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1452518?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xccui","html_url":"https://github.com/xccui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xccui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xccui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xccui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xccui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xccui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xccui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xccui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xccui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xccui/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-19T09:24:45Z","updated_at":"2017-10-19T09:24:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi @fhueske.

After being added to to the checkpoint store, the incremental handles should be complete and self contained - all placeholder handles are replaced by the real handles. What is, in fact, build up incrementally is the reference count for each sst-file handle when we re-register on recovery. So if we do not register a handle, it does not account for the reference counting, which might be correct if we assume the handle is \"dead\". However, we should not call `discardState()` on an unregistered handle because if they are unregistered, they are assumed to still own their handles and will wipe all of them without considering other references in the registry. So for most parts, we can simply rely on the remaining handles building up a reasonable count, except for handles that only still occurred in the broken incremental checkpoints. Those are leaking because we lost any way to properly delete them. But I think this kind of leak always existed in the implementation, because we cannot call dispose if we cannot retrieve the checkpoint.\r\n\r\nTo sum up: it should work, there is a leak to be aware of, but that problem always existed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/338114429/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/338117826","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4777#issuecomment-338117826","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4777","id":338117826,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzODExNzgyNg==","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-20T06:29:10Z","updated_at":"2017-10-20T06:29:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks good to me.
