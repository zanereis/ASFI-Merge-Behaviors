It's good when certain conventions help us plot the growth of the project. Similar to the apache committer lists on various Apache pages, the intent was to add folks to this list in committer order, which is the order by which they were added as committers to the project.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/576040571/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/576040652","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/7141#issuecomment-576040652","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/7141","id":576040652,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NjA0MDY1Mg==","user":{"login":"turbaszek","id":9528307,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjgzMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9528307?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek","html_url":"https://github.com/turbaszek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-19T19:59:13Z","updated_at":"2020-01-19T19:59:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":">

Our [pre-commits](\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/STATIC_CODE_CHECKS.rst#prerequisites-for-pre-commit-hooks)\nwill help you with that.\n- In case of a new feature add useful documentation (in docstrings or in `docs/` directory).\nAdding a new operator? Check this short [guide](https://github\n.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/docs/howto/custom-operator.rst) Consider adding an example DAG that shows\nhow users should use it.\n- Consider using [Breeze environment](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/BREEZE.rst) for testing\nlocally, it’s a heavy docker but it ships with a working Airflow and a lot of integrations.\n- Be patient and persistent. It might take some time to get a review or get the final approval from\nCommitters.\n\nApache Airflow is a community-driven project and together we are making it better 🚀.\n\nIn case of doubts contact the developers at:\nMailing List: dev@airflow.apache.org\nSlack: https://apache-airflow-slack.herokuapp.com/\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/576060075/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/576069916","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/7214#issuecomment-576069916","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/7214","id":576069916,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NjA2OTkxNg==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-20T01:07:00Z","updated_at":"2020-01-20T01:07:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7214?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#7214](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7214?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/commit/4dcce7be9995129c66da171c274acbafceb4e77b?src=pr&el=desc) will **decrease** coverage by `0.27%`.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7214/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&token=WdLKlKHOAU&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7214?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@            Coverage Diff             @@\n##           master    #7214      +/-   ##\n==========================================\n- Coverage   85.53%   85.25%   -0.28%     \n==========================================\n  Files         756      756              \n  Lines       39859    39859              \n==========================================\n- Hits        34093    33982     -111     \n- Misses       5766     5877     +111\n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7214?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [airflow/models/connection.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7214/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9tb2RlbHMvY29ubmVjdGlvbi5weQ==) | `77.4% <ø> (ø)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [airflow/kubernetes/volume\\_mount.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7214/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9rdWJlcm5ldGVzL3ZvbHVtZV9tb3VudC5weQ==) | `44.44% <0%> (-55.56%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [airflow/kubernetes/volume.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7214/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9rdWJlcm5ldGVzL3ZvbHVtZS5weQ==) | `52.94% <0%> (-47.06%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [airflow/kubernetes/pod\\_launcher.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7214/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9rdWJlcm5ldGVzL3BvZF9sYXVuY2hlci5weQ==) | `45.25% <0%> (-46.72%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [airflow/kubernetes/refresh\\_config.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7214/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9rdWJlcm5ldGVzL3JlZnJlc2hfY29uZmlnLnB5) | `50.98% <0%> (-23.53%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [...rflow/contrib/operators/kubernetes\\_pod\\_operator.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7214/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9jb250cmliL29wZXJhdG9ycy9rdWJlcm5ldGVzX3BvZF9vcGVyYXRvci5weQ==) | `76.47% <0%> (-21.18%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [airflow/jobs/backfill\\_job.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7214/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9qb2JzL2JhY2tmaWxsX2pvYi5weQ==) | `91.88% <0%> (+0.28%)` | :arrow_up: |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7214?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7214?src=pr&el=footer).

yes i think it makes sense to update them; its either that or deprecate them as well. \r\n\r\nthe changes required for those operators seemed more complicated than that of MsSqlOperator because they seem to depend explicitly on pymssql features e.g. in the type mapping.  if they were trivial changes i would have updated them. but i figured they can be updated later and i wanted to keep scope of this one limited.  in the meantime, i think using them will produce a deprecation warning also, since they depend on mssqlhook.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/576174738/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/576218537","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/7216#issuecomment-576218537","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/7216","id":576218537,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NjIxODUzNw==","user":{"login":"lokeshlal","id":3168965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNjg5NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3168965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lokeshlal","html_url":"https://github.com/lokeshlal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lokeshlal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lokeshlal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lokeshlal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lokeshlal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lokeshlal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lokeshlal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lokeshlal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lokeshlal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lokeshlal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-20T10:51:10Z","updated_at":"2020-01-20T10:51:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Just

Our [pre-commits](\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/STATIC_CODE_CHECKS.rst#prerequisites-for-pre-commit-hooks)\nwill help you with that.\n- In case of a new feature add useful documentation (in docstrings or in `docs/` directory).\nAdding a new operator? Check this short [guide](https://github\n.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/docs/howto/custom-operator.rst) Consider adding an example DAG that shows\nhow users should use it.\n- Consider using [Breeze environment](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/BREEZE.rst) for testing\nlocally, it’s a heavy docker but it ships with a working Airflow and a lot of integrations.\n- Be patient and persistent. It might take some time to get a review or get the final approval from\nCommitters.\n\nApache Airflow is a community-driven project and together we are making it better 🚀.\n\nIn case of doubts contact the developers at:\nMailing List: dev@airflow.apache.org\nSlack: https://apache-airflow-slack.herokuapp.com/\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/576386590/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/576411788","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4751#issuecomment-576411788","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4751","id":576411788,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NjQxMTc4OA==","user":{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-20T19:57:00Z","updated_at":"2020-01-20T19:57:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Awesome work @amichai07 🎉 .

Commit title is the first line in commit message. As mentioned in the PR description:\r\n\r\n> Commit message/PR title starts with [AIRFLOW-NNNN]. AIRFLOW-NNNN = JIRA ID*\r\n\r\nCommit message should start with [AIRFLOW-NNNN] similarly as PR description. You can run `git commit --amend` to change it and then `git push --force` to push it. It's also quite clearly described in the \"Pull Request guidelines\": https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst#pull-request-guidelines with example:\r\n\r\n> Preface your commit's subject & PR title with [AIRFLOW-XXX] COMMIT_MSG where XXX is the JIRA number. For example: [AIRFLOW-5574] Fix Google Analytics script loading. \r\n\r\nI have a question @vsoch  - it seems that for some reason it is quite difficult to follow (for you at least). We have not only good and comprehensive documentation but also we have spend quite a lot of time to have messages printed either by the pre-commit system, or docs and require additional explanation (mostly repeating what is in the documentation already) - and pretty much careful reading the error messages could (I think) prevent asking extra questions - that was at least the goal. The messages are designed to guide you and In my answers I mostly repeat the messages already written there when you ask the question and link to already existing documentation. \r\n\r\nI am really curious why it happens. Maybe we can improve it somehow - is the documentation not written clearly enough? Is there any problem with surfacing the error messages ? Or maybe there is a problem with finding relevant information? Or maybe you need more time to get familiar with the tools we are using ? \r\n\r\nWe tried (with professional technical writer) to place the documentation exactly where it is supposed to be, plus we push it exactly at the place where problems happen (for example in pre-commit checks) and try to make it as clear as possible - but apparently you still have problems with finding it. I am really curious - would it be possible for you to explain how are you approaching it, how are you reading (or maybe not?) the messages you get and how you are understanding (or not) what we try to communicate. \r\n\r\nAs a novice user you are the best \"test\" for it - maybe also you can have some ideas, proposals or maybe even a Pull Request that can improve it and make the documentation/messages better?\r\n\r\nLooking forward to more insight.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/576467652/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/576469040","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/7223#issuecomment-576469040","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/7223","id":576469040,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NjQ2OTA0MA==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-21T00:23:10Z","updated_at":"2020-01-21T00:23:10Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7223?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#7223](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7223?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/commit/3730c24c41470cd331c5109539ee2fa0c9f4e74a?src=pr&el=desc) will **decrease** coverage by `0.28%`.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7223/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&token=WdLKlKHOAU&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7223?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@            Coverage Diff             @@\n##           master    #7223      +/-   ##\n==========================================\n- Coverage   85.52%   85.23%   -0.29%     \n==========================================\n  Files         758      758              \n  Lines       39932    39932              \n==========================================\n- Hits        34150    34038     -112     \n- Misses       5782     5894     +112\n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7223?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [airflow/gcp/example\\_dags/example\\_dataflow.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7223/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9nY3AvZXhhbXBsZV9kYWdzL2V4YW1wbGVfZGF0YWZsb3cucHk=) | `100% <ø> (ø)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [airflow/kubernetes/volume\\_mount.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7223/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9rdWJlcm5ldGVzL3ZvbHVtZV9tb3VudC5weQ==) | `44.44% <0%> (-55.56%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [airflow/kubernetes/volume.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7223/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9rdWJlcm5ldGVzL3ZvbHVtZS5weQ==) | `52.94% <0%> (-47.06%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [airflow/kubernetes/pod\\_launcher.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7223/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9rdWJlcm5ldGVzL3BvZF9sYXVuY2hlci5weQ==) | `45.25% <0%> (-46.72%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [airflow/kubernetes/refresh\\_config.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7223/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9rdWJlcm5ldGVzL3JlZnJlc2hfY29uZmlnLnB5) | `50.98% <0%> (-23.53%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [...rflow/contrib/operators/kubernetes\\_pod\\_operator.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7223/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9jb250cmliL29wZXJhdG9ycy9rdWJlcm5ldGVzX3BvZF9vcGVyYXRvci5weQ==) | `76.47% <0%> (-21.18%)` | :arrow_down: |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7223?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7223?src=pr&el=footer).

I have limited bandwidth to read into the minute details so I tend to be responsive over proactive in terms of reading everything first, and I would say this tends to be the case for a large subset of contributors - we understand the basics and rely on the CI to tell us what to fix, and don’t expect all the other bells and whistles with new tools and steps we have to learn for just this PR. For this particular PR I found when I tried to follow the docs it was more trouble than just looking at the errors in the CI and fixing them one by one. When I largely ignored the docs and just looked at the CI and tried to fix things on my own based on that I was finally able to make progress. Your links and verbose re-explanation of current docs I know are done with good intention, but a large chunk sort of just confused me more.\r\n\r\nIf it makes you feel better, just chock it up to me being an idiot and I promise I’ll never bother this community again.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/576470774/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/576470784","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/7191#issuecomment-576470784","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/7191","id":576470784,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NjQ3MDc4NA==","user":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-21T00:34:06Z","updated_at":"2020-01-21T00:34:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> The linting appears to be all set, but since Singularity is installed, the tests are obviously going to fail. Let me know how you would like to proceed - it's a non trivial thing to get Singularity installed from within Travis.\r\n\r\nI don't think we have enough singularity experience to add it. We approached in various ways for other integrations:\r\n- some of the integrations (mongo etc.) are installed as docker-compose images (for example here: https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/scripts/ci/docker-compose/integration-mongo.yml) \r\n- some of them (Kubernetes) are installed via kind (Kubernetes-in-Docker) - here: https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/scripts/ci/in_container/kubernetes/setup_kind_cluster.sh\r\n- some of them we install inside the docker container via regular Dockerfile image build instructions  (minicluster/hive/hadoop) - https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/3730c24c41470cd331c5109539ee2fa0c9f4e74a/Dockerfile#L152 https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/Dockerfile#L185\r\n\r\nI do not know if/whether any of such options is possible for Singularity - please take a look and see  if this is possible to use either of the options above?\r\n\r\nIf we find integration too difficult - In a number cases we rely on \"unit tests\" where we mock the external systems and mark the integration tests as skipped - we have a custom marker `pytest.mark.integration` that does it: https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/TESTING.rst#running-integration-tests . If you have `pytest.mark.integration(\"singularity\")` as decorator, the test will be skipped unless you have INTEGRATION_SINGULARITY env variable defined. You can leave such tests in the code and manually test it when you have singularity (but it's best if we can figure out a way to add it to the docker-compose we are already running).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/576470784/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/576471260","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/7191#issuecomment-576471260","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/7191","id":576471260,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NjQ3MTI2MA==","user":{"login":"vsoch","id":814322,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNDMyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/814322?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsoch","html_url":"https://github.com/vsoch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsoch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsoch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsoch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsoch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsoch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsoch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsoch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsoch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsoch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-21T00:37:21Z","updated_at":"2020-01-21T00:37:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"You definitely can’t get a fully working Singularity from within Docker (even with privileged it’s a bit janky) so I’ll need to look at the other options and decide what is most logical to try first.

I certainly don't think of you as an idiot, and I would never, ever call anyone idiot, just because that person has no time, or bandwidth or capacity, to read and understand the TON of documentation we have. And if anything - that's a sign that maybe we should do better. You seem to be competent and you know how to program and fix things on your own and do your best to do it - I certainly cannot blame you that you do not know our complex setup.\r\n\r\nAnd Airflow IS a complex project. It has a LOT of moving parts and my goal is to make it approachable to even one-time contributors and my ultimate goal is to make it as easy and painless as possible - while keeping the high bar on quality, test automation, check automation etc. \r\n\r\nI am just curious what are the obstacles to that - and whether we could make it somewhat easier to someone like you who just comes to the project from outside for a short time. That's why I am looking for some suggestions/areas of improvements. I know the project too well myself to see the obstacles - there is even a term for that \"Expert Blindness\" - http://mnav.com/expert-blindness/ that's why I am looking for help and suggestions of people like you.\r\n\r\nTo have the project much easier approachable is my goal from the very beginning of the project and - believe me - a year ago it took literally days to set it all up so that you could run tests. Now (if we do not have sudden breakage of master by 3rd party dependencies) you can have it up and running in 10 minutes (with fast network).\r\n\r\nI think so far - by looking of what you've done, I will make a few improvements:\r\n\r\n- I am going to make \"Breeze\" THE default dev environment (we have it much lighter as of a few weeks) and if you had it installed (by simply running ./breeze command), then pre-commit would just work out-of-the box\r\n\r\nor (and?)\r\n\r\n- we can direct new contributors to simply follow the CI messages - they are descriptive enough and should be good to start\r\n\r\nI already added a few improvements to Contributing and we even have this PR in progress to explain how communication is expected to look like : https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/7204 - I will be happy if you add your comments there.\r\n\r\nWDYT? Anything else you think we can improve to make it more approachable?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/576475634/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/576477396","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/7191#issuecomment-576477396","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/7191","id":576477396,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NjQ3NzM5Ng==","user":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-21T01:13:15Z","updated_at":"2020-01-21T01:13:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> But one quick note - regardless of the testing troubles, the support on this PR has been absolutely excellent, night and day when compared to my previous experience. I'm really appreciative of that :)\r\n\r\nThanks for the kind words :). The trouble with that it that we can't afford to spend that much time  for every single new person coming :(. The project needs to be scalable. That's why my goal is to have it all as smooth as possible and as easy to self-study and self-discover as possible - only reaching out to mentors/committers/other experienced contributors when really needed. \r\nOf course you can't do it from day 1 or even day 5, but my hope is that if we relentlessly work on it and improve it and also get a lot of feedback from people like you - we can approach this \"ideal\" where everything is self-explanatory and easy to follow.

It doesn't look related to my change, e.g. test_cli.py timesout. test_external_task_sensors.py times out in one of the test profiles (Tests sqlite python 3.5), again I don't think it's due to my change. Is there some known issue with the tests in v1-10-test? The same tests in master seem to work just fine.\r\n\r\nOkay I found the problem with `test_external_task_sensors.py`. I need to set the `ExternalTaskSensor` to `mode=\"reschedule\"` in order to pass the Travis test for sqlite. I did that and the test is now happy. It's interesting the same test passes without issue in master branch.\r\n\r\nFor `test_cli.py`, I have double checked it is unrelated to my PR. I tried running the same test using clean `upstream/v1-10-test`, it fails too. So it's likely some other issue that should be addressed in a separate PR by someone else.\r\n\r\n@kaxil  pls take a look if you have a chance.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/576619381/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/576620927","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/7218#issuecomment-576620927","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/7218","id":576620927,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NjYyMDkyNw==","user":{"login":"envious","id":5093407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTM0MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5093407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/envious","html_url":"https://github.com/envious","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/envious/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/envious/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/envious/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/envious/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/envious/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/envious/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/envious/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/envious/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/envious/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-21T10:35:31Z","updated_at":"2020-01-21T10:35:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Hi @envious , Thank you for your PR.\r\n> \r\n> Your PR should target **master** branch, currently, it is targeted to **v1-10-stable** .

Our [pre-commits](\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/STATIC_CODE_CHECKS.rst#prerequisites-for-pre-commit-hooks)\nwill help you with that.\n- In case of a new feature add useful documentation (in docstrings or in `docs/` directory).\nAdding a new operator? Check this short [guide](https://github\n.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/docs/howto/custom-operator.rst) Consider adding an example DAG that shows\nhow users should use it.\n- Consider using [Breeze environment](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/BREEZE.rst) for testing\nlocally, it’s a heavy docker but it ships with a working Airflow and a lot of integrations.\n- Be patient and persistent. It might take some time to get a review or get the final approval from\nCommitters.\n\nApache Airflow is a community-driven project and together we are making it better 🚀.\n\nIn case of doubts contact the developers at:\nMailing List: dev@airflow.apache.org\nSlack: https://apache-airflow-slack.herokuapp.com/\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/576693279/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/576695546","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/7229#issuecomment-576695546","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/7229","id":576695546,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NjY5NTU0Ng==","user":{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-21T14:03:18Z","updated_at":"2020-01-21T14:03:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Failing tests are unrelated","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/576695546/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/576707502","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/7229#issuecomment-576707502","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/7229","id":576707502,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NjcwNzUwMg==","user":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-21T14:31:18Z","updated_at":"2020-01-21T14:31:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Looks like intermittent problem with pypi's availability /travis connection to pypi apparently python_virtualenv tests failed while installing some packages.
