\nSo, previously the queue was able to be replaced because we were unsure of what the best implementation to use and we left it wide open and required the Queue interface.  Now it requires a blocking Queue interface.\n\nWe could open it back up to allow any BlockingQueue implementation to be put in there.  However, I do not think this is a good idea or necessary.  The user shouldn't have a need to define the message passing from each StreamsOperation.  I believe the user should only have the option to decide how many datums are allowed to be on each queue.  This allows us to make changes to the local stream builder, swap the queue for other message passing systems, etc.,  without introducing breaking changes in the future.  \n\nThis is a breaking change.  Which does need to be communicated through the email list serve before this gets merged in (good catch on that).
