随着企业内服务数的增加（比如1万以上服务），namespace下的key-value数量是：服务数✖️2+节点数✖️4（1条提供者{application.name}、1条消费者{application.name}、1条{service:version:group}、1条消费者{application.name}.condition-router、1条{service:version:group}.condition-router、1条消费者{application.name}.tag-router），这个对Apollo整体性能容量、网络压力影响有多大？\r\n\r\n因为通常需要配置规则的 service 还是少数的，并且 application 级别配置的引入一方面原因也是为了减少配置维护量。所以我认为实际和理论数据量还是会有些差异。\r\n\r\n> 3. namespace下节点级的{application.name}.configurators和服务级的{service:version:group}.configurators的边界模糊。某些服务级别配置2个key下都能用。\r\n\r\n这个问题能否具体再描述一下？\r\n\r\n> 4. namespace中的key-value的key和value中yaml内的key存在意义冲突。\r\n\r\n能否举个例子。因为按照设计，`value中yaml内的key` 是不暴露到用户侧的，由 Dubbo-Admin 来自动填充，屏蔽掉 `key-value的key` 和 `value中yaml内的key`  的转换和差异。\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/558455168/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/558498031","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/4123#issuecomment-558498031","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4123","id":558498031,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1ODQ5ODAzMQ==","user":{"login":"zonghaishang","id":15549777,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTQ5Nzc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15549777?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang","html_url":"https://github.com/zonghaishang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-26T07:26:07Z","updated_at":"2019-11-26T07:26:07Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Expected
