have a few general notes w.r.t. this PR:\n- The code tends to overcatch exceptions, usually catching the `Exception`  class directly. Is such overcatching really necessary ?\n- When the code logs exceptions, it logs only the runtime type of them via GetType(). Is it sufficient for debugging purposes ?\n- In tests, we should probably explain in a comment how we set the expected test values.\n- A common source of cascading failures in distributed systems is an attempt to require a lot of resources at once. In this PR, what would happen if an IMRU job with a large number of mappers suddenly loses half of them and then tries to resubmit them all at once ? I believe this case deserves a special test with YARN.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/242154743/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/242178091","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/1106#issuecomment-242178091","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/1106","id":242178091,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MjE3ODA5MQ==","user":{"login":"motus","id":31380,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMzgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31380?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/motus","html_url":"https://github.com/motus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/motus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/motus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/motus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/motus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/motus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/motus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/motus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/motus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/motus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-24T19:18:51Z","updated_at":"2016-08-24T19:18:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@shulmanb I am running tests on my PC now.

agree. We catch SystemException rather than Exception in many places. If we want to change, we should change it cross entire REEF code. Even with that, at the places where we catch SystemException but not Exception in general, if we change catch SystemException to Exception, we might catch exceptions we did not intent to catch. A better way is to search all the places where SystemException is caught and look at case by case. \nAnother concern is our client will have the same issue.

For instance, there are some changes to Tang, Wake and REEF Common. I understand that the changes to IMRU are somewhat atomic, but at least those changes outside the IMRU and Networking packages could be done in separate PRs, right? They seem to fix genuine bugs in those layers that we'd want to highlight in the change log and release notes for 0.16.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/243844162/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/243845091","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/1110#issuecomment-243845091","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/1110","id":243845091,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0Mzg0NTA5MQ==","user":{"login":"markusweimer","id":502371,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjM3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/502371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer","html_url":"https://github.com/markusweimer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-31T17:51:03Z","updated_at":"2016-08-31T17:51:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM, will test and merge\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/243845091/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/243845385","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/1087#issuecomment-243845385","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/1087","id":243845385,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0Mzg0NTM4NQ==","user":{"login":"tcNickolas","id":10113024,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTEzMDI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10113024?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas","html_url":"https://github.com/tcNickolas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-31T17:51:57Z","updated_at":"2016-08-31T17:51:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@markusweimer Yes, they can be done in separate PRs. However, when done separately, they need to be tested separately. They haven't been found with old IMRU code base, so they'd need to be tested with the new code, like we already did.
