I'm interested in this and I have some thoughts:\r\n\r\n1. I think python client will benefit most data engineers. However, if we decide to support more for them, DataFrame is an essential API we have to support but it has not been done in this PR.\r\n2. For data analysis, a python client is not enough because it has poor effecience for large amount data. So we still need a effecient communication protocol (maybe RPC) between Doris BE server and client.\r\n\r\nI think these two are essential and important. Are you interested for a further diving in this way? It's a really wonderful feature and welcome you to contribute more for this and I could offer some helps for you","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/1166217354/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/1166230408","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/10320#issuecomment-1166230408","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/10320","id":1166230408,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBfSlxs5Fg0OI","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-25T08:45:38Z","updated_at":"2022-06-25T08:45:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"PR

```sql\r\n> explode_numbers\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nYes, TVF numbers could be implemented by using explode_numbers TF.  Numbers is only a simple demo for TVF. We will implement more table valued functions based on this framework. For example, we could implement TVF segments table function. Segments table valued function will have columns (dbid, tableid, rowsetid, segment id, columnname, column type, compressed columnsize, org size).  System admin could get many detail info from this tvf. And we could also add some metric TVF like compactions. We could get current running compactions from every BE.

It is better to add some documents to official website to guide users to use this Python API to do some jobs like stream load rather than add the source code to the repository. If someone else in community modifies the code, he (or she) may not notice to contribute the code to the upstream [DorisClient](https://github.com/TurboWay/DorisClient). It is hard to maintain duplicate code. You (@TurboWay ) can left the information in documents to guide users to give feedback to [DorisClient](https://github.com/TurboWay/DorisClient).\r\n2.
