This helps us improve the documentation. We will try to make clarifications in the documentation according to your feedbacks.\r\n\r\n>  I couldn't find any information on how to configure SerDe for Pulsar IO? \r\n\r\nPulsar IO is more about getting data in and out. Most of the connectors just transferred `bytes`. Some of the connectors like CDC and JDBC will attempt to deserialize the events using pulsar generic schema.\r\n\r\nCurrently Pulsar IO doesn't provide the ability to run `functions` along with the connectors. There are issues created for looking into that space.\r\n\r\n>  I would like to use external protobuf schemas:\r\n\r\nYou can construct a schema instance using `Schema.PROTOBUF(<generated-protobuf-class>.class)`. Then you can use the schema instance in your applications to publish the protobuf messages to a pulsar topic. \r\n\r\nAssume your generated protobuf class is `ProtobufClass`. Then you can write functions as followings:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class TestFunction implements Function<ProtobufClass, Void> {\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhen you submit such a function, you can specify `--schema-type PROTOBUF`. If you want to use your own SerDe, you can specify `--custom-serde-inputs`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/489402850/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/489424798","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/4206#issuecomment-489424798","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/4206","id":489424798,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4OTQyNDc5OA==","user":{"login":"ambition119","id":20353043,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzUzMDQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20353043?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambition119","html_url":"https://github.com/ambition119","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambition119/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambition119/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambition119/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambition119/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambition119/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambition119/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambition119/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambition119/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambition119/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-05T13:05:57Z","updated_at":"2019-05-05T13:05:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"client
