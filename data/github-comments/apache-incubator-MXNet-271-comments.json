I'm attaching a code example that triggers the regression:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport mxnet as mx\r\nfrom mxnet import gluon, autograd\r\n\r\nvocab_size = 10\r\nnum_embed = 100\r\nnum_hidden = 1024\r\nlayout = \"TNC\"\r\n\r\n\r\nclass Encoder(gluon.Block):\r\n    def __init__(self):\r\n        super().__init__()\r\n        with self.name_scope():\r\n            self.embedding = mx.gluon.nn.Embedding(vocab_size, num_embed)\r\n            self.rnn = mx.gluon.rnn.GRU(hidden_size=num_hidden, layout=layout)\r\n\r\n    def forward(self, inputs, hidden):\r\n        emb = self.embedding(inputs)\r\n        output, hidden = self.rnn(emb, hidden)\r\n        return output, hidden\r\n\r\n\r\nclass Decoder(gluon.Block):\r\n    def __init__(self):\r\n        super().__init__()\r\n        with self.name_scope():\r\n            self.embedding = mx.gluon.nn.Embedding(vocab_size, num_embed)\r\n            self.rnn = mx.gluon.rnn.GRU(hidden_size=num_hidden, layout=layout)\r\n            self.projection = mx.gluon.nn.Dense(units=vocab_size)\r\n\r\n    def forward(self, inputs, hidden):\r\n        emb = self.embedding(inputs)\r\n        output, hidden = self.rnn(emb, hidden)\r\n        projection = self.projection(output.reshape((-1, num_hidden)))\r\n        projection = projection.reshape((-1, inputs.shape[1], vocab_size))\r\n        return projection, hidden\r\n\r\n\r\nencoder = Encoder()\r\ndecoder = Decoder()\r\nloss = gluon.loss.SoftmaxCrossEntropyLoss(batch_axis=1)\r\n\r\nencoder.collect_params().initialize()\r\ndecoder.collect_params().initialize()\r\n\r\nencoder.hybridize()\r\ndecoder.hybridize()\r\n\r\ndata = mx.nd.zeros((10, 8), mx.cpu())\r\nbegin_state = encoder.rnn.begin_state(\r\n    func=mx.nd.zeros, batch_size=8, ctx=mx.cpu())\r\nwith autograd.record():\r\n    output, hidden = encoder(data, begin_state)\r\n    projection, _ = decoder(data, hidden)\r\n    l = loss(projection, data)\r\nl.backward()\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf hybridization is deactivated, the example works. It also works when run on gpu. It seems **un**related to MKL.\r\n\r\nThis is the error on cpu:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n[19:46:34] /home/travis/build/dmlc/mxnet-distro/mxnet-build/dmlc-core/include/dmlc/logging.h:308: [19:46:34] src/imperative/./imperative_utils.h:596: Check failed: vctx[i].dev_type != -1 (-1 vs. -1) Cannot decide context for node zeros\r\n\r\nStack trace returned 10 entries:\r\n[bt] (0) /home/leonard/.local/lib64/python3.6/site-packages/mxnet/libmxnet.so(+0x175b6c) [0x7f32ddec3b6c]\r\n[bt] (1) /home/leonard/.local/lib64/python3.6/site-packages/mxnet/libmxnet.so(+0x2051907) [0x7f32dfd9f907]\r\n[bt] (2) /home/leonard/.local/lib64/python3.6/site-packages/mxnet/libmxnet.so(+0x204a903) [0x7f32dfd98903]\r\n[bt] (3) /home/leonard/.local/lib64/python3.6/site-packages/mxnet/libmxnet.so(MXAutogradBackwardEx+0x778) [0x7f32dfcf3448]\r\n[bt] (4) /usr/lib64/libffi.so.6(ffi_call_unix64+0x4c) [0x7f32f0b94028]\r\n[bt] (5) /usr/lib64/libffi.so.6(ffi_call+0x32a) [0x7f32f0b93a8a]\r\n[bt] (6) /usr/lib64/python3.6/lib-dynload/_ctypes.cpython-36m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so(_ctypes_callproc+0x2ef) [0x7f32f0dfc51f]\r\n[bt] (7) /usr/lib64/python3.6/lib-dynload/_ctypes.cpython-36m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so(+0xa6aa) [0x7f32f0df66aa]\r\n[bt] (8) /usr/lib64/libpython3.6m.so.1.0(_PyObject_FastCallDict+0x89) [0x7f32f23a5f09]\r\n[bt] (9) /usr/lib64/libpython3.6m.so.1.0(+0x12bb73) [0x7f32f2464b73]\r\n\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"testmxnet.py\", line 56, in <module>\r\n    l.backward()\r\n  File \"/home/leonard/.local/lib64/python3.6/site-packages/mxnet/ndarray/ndarray.py\", line 1761, in backward\r\n    ctypes.c_void_p(0)))\r\n  File \"/home/leonard/.local/lib64/python3.6/site-packages/mxnet/base.py\", line 146, in check_call\r\n    raise MXNetError(py_str(_LIB.MXGetLastError()))\r\nmxnet.base.MXNetError: [19:46:34] src/imperative/./imperative_utils.h:596: Check failed: vctx[i].dev_type != -1 (-1 vs. -1) Cannot decide context for node zeros\r\n\r\nStack trace returned 10 entries:\r\n[bt] (0) /home/leonard/.local/lib64/python3.6/site-packages/mxnet/libmxnet.so(+0x175b6c) [0x7f32ddec3b6c]\r\n[bt] (1) /home/leonard/.local/lib64/python3.6/site-packages/mxnet/libmxnet.so(+0x2051907) [0x7f32dfd9f907]\r\n[bt] (2) /home/leonard/.local/lib64/python3.6/site-packages/mxnet/libmxnet.so(+0x204a903) [0x7f32dfd98903]\r\n[bt] (3) /home/leonard/.local/lib64/python3.6/site-packages/mxnet/libmxnet.so(MXAutogradBackwardEx+0x778) [0x7f32dfcf3448]\r\n[bt] (4) /usr/lib64/libffi.so.6(ffi_call_unix64+0x4c) [0x7f32f0b94028]\r\n[bt] (5) /usr/lib64/libffi.so.6(ffi_call+0x32a) [0x7f32f0b93a8a]\r\n[bt] (6) /usr/lib64/python3.6/lib-dynload/_ctypes.cpython-36m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so(_ctypes_callproc+0x2ef) [0x7f32f0dfc51f]\r\n[bt] (7) /usr/lib64/python3.6/lib-dynload/_ctypes.cpython-36m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so(+0xa6aa) [0x7f32f0df66aa]\r\n[bt] (8) /usr/lib64/libpython3.6m.so.1.0(_PyObject_FastCallDict+0x89) [0x7f32f23a5f09]\r\n[bt] (9) /usr/lib64/libpython3.6m.so.1.0(+0x12bb73) [0x7f32f2464b73]\r\n\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/344555936/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/344565134","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/8569#issuecomment-344565134","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/8569","id":344565134,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NDU2NTEzNA==","user":{"login":"eLvErDe","id":1586757,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODY3NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1586757?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eLvErDe","html_url":"https://github.com/eLvErDe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eLvErDe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eLvErDe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eLvErDe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eLvErDe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eLvErDe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eLvErDe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eLvErDe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eLvErDe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eLvErDe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-15T11:28:09Z","updated_at":"2017-11-15T11:28:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi there,\r\n\r\nI can confirm setting USE_GPERFTOOLS=0 fixes the issue (it was double free for me).
