sorry for the confusion.\r\nI should talk to you first.\r\n\r\nAs you proposed, I was trying to use `HttpUtils` instead of `AkkaHttpUtils` in tests.\r\nI found `AkkaHttpUtils` is being used in `ActionContainer.scala`.\r\nIn current version, it returns `(status_code, Option[value])`, but in `HttpUtils` it returns `Either[ContainerConnectionError, ContainerResponse]`.\r\nBoth of responses does not include status code.\r\n\r\nI could update `HttpUtils` to return status code as well.\r\nBut I am afraid it is not accepted, because it will affect the core logic.\r\nAnd if I modify response type to `Either[ContainerConnectionError, ContainerResponse]`, it may break semantic in test code.\r\n\r\nFor example,\r\n\r\n```\r\nit should \"abort init with empty response\" in {\r\n        val (out, err) = withContainer(\"badaction\") { c =>\r\n            val (code, out) = c.init(initPayload(\"exit\"))\r\n            code shouldBe 500\r\n            out shouldBe empty\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        out should include(\"exit\")\r\n        // err stream may not be empty if the proxy did not get a chance to\r\n        // drain the action's out/err streams; skip check on err stream\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis code, it wants to check whether it returns 500 response in case of `badaciton` container.\r\nIn some cases, response should be 502.\r\nThere are more cases.\r\n\r\n```\r\nit should \"report error if zip-encoded action does not include required file\" in {\r\n        val srcs = Seq(\r\n            Seq(\"echo.py\") -> \"\"\"\r\n                |def echo(args):\r\n                |  return { \"echo\": args }\r\n            \"\"\".stripMargin)\r\n\r\n        val code = ZipBuilder.mkBase64Zip(srcs)\r\n\r\n        val (out, err) = withActionContainer() { c =>\r\n            val (initCode, initRes) = c.init(initPayload(code, main = \"echo\"))\r\n            initCode should be(502)\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        checkStreams(out, err, {\r\n            case (o, e) =>\r\n                o shouldBe empty\r\n                e should include(\"Zip file does not include\")\r\n        })\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo if I change the response type, and omit status code, it may change semantic of many tests.\r\n\r\nI discussed with @rabbah on Slack.\r\nSince expected code changes are not that simple and small, and this thread is too long already, it would be better to open a separate pr iff you approve it.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/311459654/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/311460371","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/1790#issuecomment-311460371","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/1790","id":311460371,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMTQ2MDM3MQ==","user":{"login":"style95","id":3447251,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDcyNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3447251?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95","html_url":"https://github.com/style95","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-27T19:28:40Z","updated_at":"2017-06-27T19:28:40Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"It

,for your two suggestions\r\n* should we perhaps generate these as part of the setup rather that store them.\r\ni know it's convenient and it does take a few seconds to get a key.\r\n\r\nanswer: I

themselves refer to genssl.sh script.\r\n\r\n* can you add a test you can add that actually uses the client cert?\r\n\r\nanswer: I think there has no need to add the test, because this test case: https://github.com/ningyougang/incubator-openwhisk/blob/support-client-certificate/tests/src/test/scala/whisk/core/cli/test/WskBasicUsageTests.scala#L96 can verify the client certificate by nginx

https://github.com/ningyougang/incubator-openwhisk/blob/support-client-certificate/tools/cli/go-whisk/whisk/client.go#L87 ,after build Authorization in request Header, it will send the quest to

Also toggled in the CLI.\r\nThis way people can try it out from master without being the default.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nI don't see negative tests, if the cert or key are wrongly configured, test the expected errors is shown and no access. have multiple of this, creating a cert with correct keys, but wrong expiration date, etc.. different combination making sure if, this could also be be feature toggle via gradle task/config","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/311660489/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/311688429","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/2435#issuecomment-311688429","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/2435","id":311688429,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMTY4ODQyOQ==","user":{"login":"dubee","id":11520887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIwODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11520887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee","html_url":"https://github.com/dubee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-28T15:04:57Z","updated_at":"2017-06-28T15:04:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@mdeuser, please review.

, for your suggestions\r\n* Why not have the cert and key be compiled as a resource into the wsk CLI binary?\r\n\r\nanswer: because different user should have different cert/key, so compiled cert/key as a resource into wsk CLI binary for every user is not a good idea.   User should execute cmd `wsk -i property set --cert XX --key XX...` only one time, the cert/key will store in ~/.wskprops.\r\n\r\nIn our case is that\r\nour company has deployed  the openwhisk in our commany inner. \r\nour company has generated the client-ca.pm, and also generated the cert.pem for every user using their own `emploeeId` which is included in subj's `CN`.\r\nAbove actions are done by our securiy team, so as common emploee, we hava no need to learn openssl tool. emploee only can download their own client cert/key in comany's website.\r\nAfter download it to local desktop and download wsk client tool, we can execute `wsk property set --cert {certPath} --key {keyPath}...` to access our own openwhisk env.\r\n\r\n* For docs.\r\n\r\nanswer: i will add the docs on cli.md\r\n\r\n* Testing\r\n\r\nanswer: i will add some negative tests for support this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/311849656/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/311858822","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/2369#issuecomment-311858822","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/2369","id":311858822,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMTg1ODgyMg==","user":{"login":"csantanapr","id":1094878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTQ4Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1094878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr","html_url":"https://github.com/csantanapr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-29T04:22:43Z","updated_at":"2017-06-29T04:22:43Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@paulcastro
