integrating superset with a different oauth provider, and, while I have it working, it is an (awful) hack. \r\n\r\nHere are some tips:\r\n1.- Install Flask-OAuthlib (pip), last version, 0.9.3 \r\n2.- The decorated function (my_user_info_getter) is not longer receiving the sm object, but the providers list (sm.oauth_remotes). You can check the declaration of the decorator in flask_appbuilder/security/manager.py \r\n3.- The decorated function needs access to the superset appbuilder object (defined  in superset/__init_.py). \r\n4.- I'm also using the decorated function to check the info of the user that is already stored on the superset user datamodel, and the superset roles, and for that, I need access to the sm object. I'm totally breaking responsibilities here :(... \r\n\r\nI think that a good example of accessing sm and appbuilder  is superset/views.py... so I guess that one solution is to create a superset/my_own_security.py and put a reference on superset/ for that new library. It should be relatively easy to get new superset features working in your fork in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

for taking this on @vera-liu. i'm not sure showing this modal is the best solution. like bogdan suggested, we could add text to tell the user to re-run the query but i don't think this is a very good user experience. \r\n\r\ncomments on your other ideas: \r\n\r\n> 1. remove visualize button for all queries in query history except for latest query (users should run past queries in new editors to visualize them) \r\n\r\nwe could remove the visualize button from the query history list items altogether. if it's only present for the latest query, that seems confusing/looks like a bug if it's not displayed for the other queries. for the latest query, users will be able to use the visualize button in the results tab.\r\n\r\n# <img width=\"842\" alt=\"screenshot 2016-11-30 20 37 41\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/130878/20782036/e60cfd56-b73c-11e6-9879-3ab241573324.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n> 2. rerun query when visualize modal is triggered (this might not work with large queries and async ones \r\n\r\nthis could be a good solution but would definitely be more time consuming to get it right. i think in this case we would want to show an icon/tooltip that says re-run query to visualize. once clicked we would switch back to the results tab, update the query in the editor, and automatically start running the query. we would want to do this so the user can see that the query is running. however we also have an icon/tooltip that says `overwrite text in editor with this query` which is essentially the same thing, minus auto-running the query.\r\n\r\ni think the best solution here, balancing impact and effort, would be to remove the visualize icon from the query history list, and only have access to it from the results
