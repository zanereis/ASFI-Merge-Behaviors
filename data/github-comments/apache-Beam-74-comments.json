\r\n\r\nAs I see we have two options:\r\n1. We can leave post commit tests in a failing state until this test is fixed. This will not necessarily block developers from working on other parts but surely will slow down. Because post commit tests are not a good signal for other tests if they are already red.\r\n2. We can disable this test, and continue to work on it in parallel. Any post commit failure in the mean time would be indicative of new failures from new development.\r\n\r\nAnother option is to rollback a change. Since in this case we cannot rollback the code, we can actually rollback ValidatesRunner tests and add back again once all these tests are passing.\r\n\r\nIf I understand correctly you would like the first option.
