We need a map type value to be stored in druid to handle parameter values from various machines in manufacturing, but it's not supported. This is rather a hacky way to address the requirements. \n\nLet's assume that there is an input event from kafka, containing a map type value,\n\n```\n{\n  'timestamp'='2016-01-01 ~~',\n  'lot_id'='xxxx',\n  'machine_id'='yyyy',\n  'parameter'={'pkey1'='value1', 'pkey2'='value2'}\n}\n```\n\nWe can store `parameter` as two separate dimensions (`pkey` and `pvalue` in this example),\n\n```\n{\n  'timestamp'='2016-01-01 ~~',\n  'lot_id'='xxxx',\n  'machine_id'='yyyy',\n  'pkey'=['pkey1', 'pkey2'],\n  'pvalue'=['value1', 'value2']\n}\n```\n\nWhat we want to do with above is\n1. using bitmapindex for `pkey` to access `pvalue`\n2. retrieving it as a map if needed just like original input event\n\nWith a definition something like below(we can think `outputName` as a name of virtual column),\n\n```\n \"virtualColumns\" : [ {\n    \"type\" : \"map\",\n    \"keyDimension\" : \"pkey\",\n    \"valueDimension\" : \"pvalue\",\n    \"outputName\" : \"params\"\n  } ],\n```\n\nfor case1, we can select `params.pkey1` to access `value1` and `params.pkey2` to access `value2`\nfor case2, we can select `params` to access whole `{'pkey1'='value1', 'pkey2'='value2'}`\n\nI'm really bad at explaing something.

questions.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/190062527/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/190063813","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/2511#issuecomment-190063813","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2511","id":190063813,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MDA2MzgxMw==","user":{"login":"navis","id":809395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwOTM5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/809395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis","html_url":"https://github.com/navis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-29T06:32:26Z","updated_at":"2016-02-29T06:32:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ah,
