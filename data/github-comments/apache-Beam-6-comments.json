not which language you want. In that case, `java` means Java SDK, not Java programming language. Same with examples.\n\nIn the `runners` directory, you should pick a runner. Runner are orthogonal to SDKs -- one day we'll be able to mix-and-match. So, it makes sense to leave `spark` and `flink` as runner-level modules, as opposed to moving them user Java.\n\nNote, in the pending PR, Luke adds `google-cloud-dataflow-java` runner, which is a Java-implementation of the Google Cloud Dataflow runner. This is just adding context for the second implementation of the same runner soon to come.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/208583651/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/208588503","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/97#issuecomment-208588503","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/97","id":208588503,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwODU4ODUwMw==","user":{"login":"davorbonaci","id":8442684,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NDI2ODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8442684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davorbonaci","html_url":"https://github.com/davorbonaci","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davorbonaci/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davorbonaci/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davorbonaci/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davorbonaci/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davorbonaci/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davorbonaci/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davorbonaci/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davorbonaci/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davorbonaci/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-11T22:13:54Z","updated_at":"2016-04-11T22:13:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Left
