Which is the same speed for my whole epoch of 2,100,000 reviews \\* (105/6500) = 565 minutes. So to do 10 epochs will cost me 4 days ... which is similar to the reported run-time of the model.\n\nThe per second rate is 6400/105 which is 60 so I'm not sure why the speedometer is giving that speed in the log?\n\nWhat's a bit worrying is that I am on the 2nd epoch (lets say out of 10) and my accuracy on training is 0.51 ... I don't think it's realistic to assume it will hit 0.95 by epoch 10:\n\n```\n2016-08-24 10:19:14,630 - root - INFO - Epoch[2] Batch [5800]   Speed: 6059.23 samples/sec  Train-accuracy=0.500156\n2016-08-24 10:21:01,582 - root - INFO - Epoch[2] Batch [5850]   Speed: 5984.89 samples/sec  Train-accuracy=0.512344\n2016-08-24 10:22:46,565 - root - INFO - Epoch[2] Batch [5900]   Speed: 6096.17 samples/sec  Train-accuracy=0.511563\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/242008680/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/242054525","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/3032#issuecomment-242054525","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/3032","id":242054525,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MjA1NDUyNQ==","user":{"login":"Johnqczhang","id":7107859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDc4NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7107859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johnqczhang","html_url":"https://github.com/Johnqczhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johnqczhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johnqczhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johnqczhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johnqczhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johnqczhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johnqczhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johnqczhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johnqczhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johnqczhang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-24T13:01:10Z","updated_at":"2016-08-25T04:45:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @albertyou2 I also met this problem and I agree with you. \nI updated my mxnet to the latest so far, and I ran a cifar10 example with record data downloaded from http://data.dmlc.ml/mxnet/data/cifar10.zip, the training accuracy looks like normal but validation accuracy is bad (barely increase after an epoch). \nThen, I replace ImageRecordIter for validation set with an ImageDataIter that directly read image from the disk, and this time the validation accuracy is good. \nI trained an Inception-BN model that defines in https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/master/example/image-classification/symbol_inception-bn-28-small.py by using two GPUs with cudnn_v5.1 on a single machine.\nHope this may help you find the problem as soon as possible.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/242054525/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/242139455","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/3118#issuecomment-242139455","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/3118","id":242139455,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MjEzOTQ1NQ==","user":{"login":"wellner","id":2430406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MzA0MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2430406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wellner","html_url":"https://github.com/wellner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wellner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wellner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wellner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wellner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wellner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wellner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wellner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wellner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wellner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-24T17:08:42Z","updated_at":"2016-08-24T17:08:42Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Ah, I think I can see how to do that via a combination of shared weights and explicitly setting learning rates (negative).

To use this DataIter, you should specify the image list file (.lst file) and the root directory of images, and specify other params just like ImageRecordIter. You can see an example here: https://github.com/Johnqczhang/mxnet/blob/mymxnet/example/image-classification/train_cifar10_img.py#L102, and the source code of ImageDataIter is in https://github.com/Johnqczhang/mxnet/blob/mymxnet/python/mxnet/io.py#L699.\nIf you find any bug or problem, please let me know.
