As soon as an input tuple arrives for T1, it is inserted into the respective hash table for T1 and then immediately used to probe the hash table for T2. If a match is found, output tuple can potentially be produced. \r\n\r\nSo the operator essentially alternates between reading both sides and probing each other to produce matching tuples asap until one side is exhausted. IIRC, Postgres had plans of implementing SHJ but not sure if it is part of the codebase. \r\n\r\n@ankitsultana  - is your suggestion somewhat along the above or something different ?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1401391177/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1401419711","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/10170#issuecomment-1401419711","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/10170","id":1401419711,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5Th_e_","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-24T05:36:04Z","updated_at":"2023-01-27T05:39:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/10170?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) Report\n> Merging [#10170](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/10170?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (5d379e9) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/commit/4d7da0abab9563d95d139e11d054da2f0f5d45d8?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (4d7da0a) will **increase** coverage by `35.60%`.\n> The diff coverage is `40.00%`.\n\n```diff\n@@              Coverage Diff              @@\n##             master   #10170       +/-   ##\n=============================================\n+ Coverage     34.84%   70.44%   +35.60%     \n- Complexity      200     5800     +5600     \n=============================================\n  Files          2006     2020       +14     \n  Lines        108718   109144      +426     \n  Branches      16501    16570       +69     \n=============================================\n+ Hits          37880    76886    +39006     \n+ Misses        67566    26876    -40690     \n- Partials       3272     5382     +2110     \n```\n\n| Flag | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| integration1 | `24.61% <0.00%> (+0.10%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| integration2 | `24.27% <0.00%> (-0.02%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| unittests1 | `67.81% <40.00%> (?)` | |\n| unittests2 | `13.69% <0.00%> (+0.05%)` | :arrow_up: |\n\nFlags with carried forward coverage won't be shown.

Let me continue to look in to the consume loop to see if there is other places where consumption could be stuck that would lead to such increases.\r\n\r\nI have looked at the consume loop code and have the following suggestions:\r\n\r\nCan you enable debug logs: there is a wealth of debug/info traces in that can help us tell the difference of consumption patterns between your partitions and what leads to the ramping up times. Currently there are two places where this code blocks: on fetching a message batch from stream (configurable timeout described above) and right after we get an empty batch where we block for 100milliseconds. \r\n\r\nWe also have a number of other interesting metrics which you should correlate with the graph above:\r\nLLC_PARTITION_CONSUMING should indicate if the partition is actively consuming or not\r\nHIGHEST_STREAM_OFFSET_CONSUMED\r\nREALTIME_ROWS_CONSUMED\r\nINVALID_REALTIME_ROWS_DROPPED\r\nINCOMPLETE_REALTIME_ROWS_CONSUMED\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso another question for you: is there any filtering of messages going on? I noticed that if we do get a batch of messages and all are filtered the metric could reflect the lag for the last unfiltered message\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1403953161/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1404059312","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/10139#issuecomment-1404059312","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/10139","id":1404059312,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5TsD6w","user":{"login":"Ferix9288","id":1356299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTYyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1356299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferix9288","html_url":"https://github.com/Ferix9288","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferix9288/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferix9288/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferix9288/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferix9288/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferix9288/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferix9288/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferix9288/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferix9288/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferix9288/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-25T18:38:26Z","updated_at":"2023-01-25T18:38:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hey @Jackie-Jiang ,\r\n\r\nI just pulled the latest snapshot from yesterday (0.13.0-SNAPSHOT-9105a06ce8-20230125) but seems like my fixes in this PR never appears baked in the image.

Looking forward to this.\r\nCouple of questions:\r\n1. `Server Query Executor sends the incoming query to the main segment as well as the temporary segment if there is one` - Could you elaborate on this? How will we send the query to temporary segment, if there's no record of it in ideal state/external view, given the EV is what drives all the routing logic? I'm wondering if that would end up looking like a lot of if-else in the query execution at consuming segment level, as we won't have any info about this segment in the planner/executor etc.\r\n2. What Jackie suggested, was also what came to my mind instantly when I read the problem statement. It does seema. lot more natural and a clean extension, and will reduce the number of special cases we'd have to think about. We can still set it up to consume 20% of the main segment size if that's what is deemed best, and update it when we have that definitive number.

Will use a new api for broker. \"Force\" is sort of misunderstanding. I haven't came up with an appropriate name yet. I actually wanted to do it in a safer way. Here is my implementation idea: (1) untag the broker first; (2) Then parallel call the rebuildBrokerResourceFromHelixTags api per table which is assigned to that node in the ideal state. (3) Delete the instance id. \r\n\r\nAs for server, I suppose the same idea can be adopted. The step 2 can be replaced the existing table rebalance api. One concern the rebalancing is time consuming, shall we do it async? For example, we can set the state to \"delete_pre\" before step 1. And directly return a response (maybe a task id?) to user. Once the step 3 is done, set the state to \"delete_complete\". User can use this state (or the task id) to know whether the deletion is complete. If the long time workflow fail in the middle, maybe we can use minion (I suppose minion is good for task scheduling) to find out nodes with \"delete_pre\" state existing for >1h and retry.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1405792829/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1405795170","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/10185#issuecomment-1405795170","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/10185","id":1405795170,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5Tyrti","user":{"login":"Jackie-Jiang","id":17555551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTU1NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17555551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang","html_url":"https://github.com/Jackie-Jiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-26T23:11:02Z","updated_at":"2023-01-26T23:11:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think I know the reason why it is also impacting regular tables.\r\nFor partial upsert table, we need to first load all sealed segments to restore the history before starting the consumption.

How will we send the query to temporary segment, if there's no record of it in ideal state/external view, given the EV is what drives all the routing logic? I'm wondering if that would end up looking like a lot of if-else in the query execution at consuming segment level, as we won't have any info about this segment in the planner/executor etc.\r\n\r\nI was thinking of using a `PauselessConsumptionManager` that knows which consuming segments have kicked off their corresponding temporary segments. `Server Query Executor` simply passed in the list of `segmentsToQuery` to the pauseless consumption manager and that returns the list of temporary segments to be added to segmentsToQuery list. So there's not a lot of `if-else`es.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I agree that Jackie's suggestion is 1) more explicit and 2) it also has the benefit that if the next consuming segment is going to be assigned to a different server, the data in temporary segment of the current server doesn't need to be thrown away.\r\n\r\nIf we want to take that route, we need to think of how to address the followings:\r\n1. final number of rows for the new segment\r\n2. segment commit failure\r\n\r\nFor the first one, we can start the next segment (les't call it S2) with the same size of the existing one (S1). When S1 commits successfully, we can calculate the proper size for S2 and if the new size is within a threshold (something like 5%) of the size of S1, we can assume S2 size is good enough so we leave it as is. If the new size is not within the 5% threshold, then we send a helix transition message from Controller to the servers hosting S2 to create a new mutable segment with the new size and copy over the data.\r\n\r\nFor the second problem, I think we need to change the commit protocol a bit, because currently we assume if there's commit failure, segments which have been on hold will simply start over. With pauseless consumption, since the new segment (S2) already has started consumption with a specific start offset, we need to make sure the commit protocol for S1 ends with the same offset.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1405873383/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1405890147","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/10147#issuecomment-1405890147","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/10147","id":1405890147,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5TzC5j","user":{"login":"mcvsubbu","id":2279037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzkwMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2279037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu","html_url":"https://github.com/mcvsubbu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-27T01:16:07Z","updated_at":"2023-01-27T01:16:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Changing the idealstate is a much more complex solution, and will have the number of rows to consume as an unresolved point.

With regard to theta sketches, they take an additional parameter that controls the number of retained entries, which ultimately affects both size and accuracy. This might be worth taking into consideration as an argument to the transform function.\n\nIt would be nice to have a data type abstraction associated with metrics - in this way users could create additional data types and know exactly what functions are required to support it through the stack.
