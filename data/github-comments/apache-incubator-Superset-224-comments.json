Simply importing the `superset` package has a ton of side effects, including creation of a single, global flask application itself.  My guess is by the time any test runs it will already have a fully constructed application that depends on all side effects of all of the global code in that `__init__.py`, so mocking the value and changing it in a test won't affect the actual pre-constructed-at-import-time behavior of the endpoint methods.\r\n\r\nSide note: I think some minor investment in refactoring `superset/__init__.py` so that it exposes types and functions etc but _doesn't actually construct or do anything_ until you ask it to would be great.  Then tests would be able to tweak things and construct a new app for testing under the new construction parameters.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/491841741/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/491849107","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/7496#issuecomment-491849107","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/7496","id":491849107,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MTg0OTEwNw==","user":{"login":"request-info[bot]","id":30733101,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MzA3MzMxMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/4234?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/request-info%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/request-info","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/request-info%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/request-info%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/request-info%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/request-info%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/request-info%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/request-info%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/request-info%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/request-info%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/request-info%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-13T14:36:16Z","updated_at":"2019-05-13T14:36:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"We would appreciate it if you could provide us with more info about this issue/pr!

That's unintuitive to some business users. Since the cursor is already there, it would be better if they could simply refresh with the same button. One could argue that clearing filters prompts a refresh, but if you have as many tables as we do, you don't want to do that unless you want to do that if you catch my drift. \r\n\r\nSo, here's the new version from this PR:\r\n\r\nstart with a filter:\r\n<img width=\"1237\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-05-14 at 10 54 14 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2353608/57720798-76356380-7637-11e9-8d6c-7d6f2a6f8381.png\">\r\n\r\nClear the filter and you still have control (see new button)\r\n<img width=\"1251\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-05-14 at 10 54 23 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2353608/57720874-9ebd5d80-7637-11e9-883e-c917f46ee2ec.png\">\r\n\r\nAnd after clicking the refresh button (you get unfiltered results)\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1260\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-05-14 at 10 54 31 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2353608/57720993-ea700700-7637-11e9-8b6c-5b76dafeb685.png\">\r\n:\r\n\r\nLet me know if this makes sense.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/492345703/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/492369451","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/7429#issuecomment-492369451","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/7429","id":492369451,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MjM2OTQ1MQ==","user":{"login":"graceguo-supercat","id":27990562,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3OTkwNTYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27990562?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat","html_url":"https://github.com/graceguo-supercat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-14T19:08:22Z","updated_at":"2019-05-14T19:08:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"concern on the amount of polling requests, i think #7498 might be better.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/492369451/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/492390321","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/6931#issuecomment-492390321","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/6931","id":492390321,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MjM5MDMyMQ==","user":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-14T20:08:45Z","updated_at":"2019-05-14T20:08:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had recent activity.
