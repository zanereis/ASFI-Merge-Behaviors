got rid of `forms.py` as we moved a lot of this logic to the frontend to build a more responsive React app. There's an equivalent `fields.js` file now. \r\n\r\nI'm confused as to how to handle TopN in Druid. It appears that each node or segment processing returns a local TopN and the coordinator merges the results. In our case on high cardinality TopN queries we've seen much of the long tail making it through and incomplete results for items that actually fit in the real TopN.\r\n\r\nUser may want and expect a few things:\r\n* The data is evenly distributed and TopN happens to perform well and results are mostly accurate. We may still want to \"pad the TopN\" (user asks for top 50, but we run a top 100 or something somewhat arbitrary to give room) and shop off the tail\r\n* Would adding a phase to the query help? First get the topN say 50, then run another TopN query that filters on this. I still feel like this logic belongs in the Druid API, not on our side...\r\n* Letting the user force a group by when they need accurate results. This would be a checkbox \"Avoid TopN queries\" that would force a GroupBy query\r\n* Letting the user define the TopN number AND the actual number of value that we should truncate to.\r\n\r\nI may take this to the Druid user group and have a conversation there.

something.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/280697943/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/280728659","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/2161#issuecomment-280728659","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/2161","id":280728659,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MDcyODY1OQ==","user":{"login":"bkyryliuk","id":5727938,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Mjc5Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5727938?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk","html_url":"https://github.com/bkyryliuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-17T18:27:58Z","updated_at":"2017-02-17T18:27:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"LGTM","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/280728659/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/280743695","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/2171#issuecomment-280743695","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/2171","id":280743695,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MDc0MzY5NQ==","user":{"login":"kaiosama","id":2148119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDgxMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2148119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaiosama","html_url":"https://github.com/kaiosama","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaiosama/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaiosama/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaiosama/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaiosama/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaiosama/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaiosama/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaiosama/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaiosama/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaiosama/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-17T19:27:55Z","updated_at":"2017-02-17T19:28:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"update:
