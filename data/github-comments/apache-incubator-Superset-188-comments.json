However, the 'Share Dashboard' generated link was changed to no longer use filter box IDs.\r\n\r\nFor the current implementation of Superset, if you have two filter boxes, both with a 'country' filter, selecting 'Bhutan' in one filter box still applies the filter across all charts -- including other filter boxes (the other filter box is blank, but only allows you to select 'Bhutan' as a filter). This all works as before. \r\n\r\nWhen visiting the dashboard with`preselect_filters={\"75\":{\"country\":[\"Bhutan\"]}}`, current functionality will set filter box 75 'country' to 'Bhutan' while leaving the other filter box blank, but only able to select 'Bhutan'.

It's more flexible than scoped filters (though less intuitive and much harder to setup), because you can set things up so that any filter can apply any subset of charts.\r\n\r\nFor your use case, it may be possible to do what you are trying to do using `filter_immune_slice_fields` with the special field `__time`. Your case is a bit special because you have 2 `Filter Box` components that emit filtering events on the same \"field\" (`__time`) and that may not be handled properly.\r\n\r\nI have to look at the code to see whether the `filter_immune_slice_fields` + `__time` approach would work not, and if not, what it would take to make it work.\r\n\r\nDid you try `filter_immune_slice_fields` using `__time` yet btw?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/453153587/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/453156280","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/6623#issuecomment-453156280","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/6623","id":453156280,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MzE1NjI4MA==","user":{"login":"UZi02","id":8860361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NjAzNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8860361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/UZi02","html_url":"https://github.com/UZi02","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UZi02/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UZi02/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UZi02/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UZi02/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UZi02/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UZi02/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UZi02/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UZi02/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UZi02/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-10T16:20:16Z","updated_at":"2019-01-10T16:20:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"How should this help when using 2 filter boxes?
