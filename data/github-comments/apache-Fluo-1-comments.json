In addition to different classes, it possible that an observer could be missing.  For example if a M/R job is loading data, there is no need for it to have all of the Observers on its class path. \n\nOne way to resolve this is the load the Observers at initialization time, ask the Observers which columns they observe, and then store that info in zookeeper.  This way there is a consistent view across the cluster of what columns to notify on.  Initialization should log at INFO what its persisting.  Updating this info would be an administrative option.  With this strategy, the only configuration needed for initialization is a list of observers.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/46347517/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/46425812","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fluo/issues/1#issuecomment-46425812","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/1","id":46425812,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NDI1ODEy","user":{"login":"mikewalch","id":730698,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMDY5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/730698?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch","html_url":"https://github.com/mikewalch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-06-18T11:51:59Z","updated_at":"2014-06-18T11:51:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Accismus oracles and workers can now be started across a cluster using YARN.

The former prevents attacks from giant legitimate requests, the latter prevents garbage from bringing it down. This is something I recently fixed in Accumulo, but I really don't feel like digging up the ticket number right now. I'm sure you can find it.

I saw a synchronization problem, I will comment about that on the patch.   I am still thinking this over, but I am thinking of a slightly different model.  I am not sure about the behavior of one thread closing the connection while another is using.  Below is some code to try to outline what I am thinking.  I am thinking of checking if the oracle changed _after_ making an RPC call to the oracle.   \n\n``` java\nclass OracleClient {\n\n  //leader id format : <ip>:<port>:<uuid>\n  private String

the connection\n             myConnectedLeaderID = connectedLeader\n             myClient = client\n         }\n\n          time = myClient.getTimestamps(...);\n\n          //check for leader change AFTER talking to oracle... it posible \n          //when the request was sent the connection was to a valid \n          //oracle... but maybe  that oracle paused and processed our \n          //request after losing leadership\n          if(!myConnectedLeaderID.equals(getCurrentLeaderID()){\n            reconnect();\n            continue;\n          }\n          break;\n        }\n\n         .\n         . \n         .\n     }\n\n  //code to connect to oracle server... this method synced because want to \n  //set client and connectorLeaderID together\n  synchronized connect(){\n     tmpID = leaderSelector.getLeader().getID();\n     //make thrift connection\n\n     //ensure oracle is uuid we expect.. .this ensures oracle server is one we \n     //expect\n     if(!client.checkID(getUUID(tmpID))){\n        throw;\n     }\n\n     //only set this after successful connection\n     connectorLeaderID = tmpID;\n\n  }\n\n  public void childEvent( ){\n     if
