I feel the tests are still useful. Those tests were created to test alias and evaluator configurations. We don't have other tests to cover them. The tests are especially useful when Java side changed evaluator configuration settings, we can then replace the evaluator.config and repro the issue. I used it for debug many times. \nAnother test covered by those are alias. Even alias is Tang annotation and we can use Tang unit test to do it. The purpose of those tests are to make sure all the alias are created and set correctly for the configurations we use in the evaluators. That cannot be covered by Tang unit testing. \nI agree for now the evaluator.config is copied offline in the test. What we need is to improve it to make it to automatic, for example, use the evaluator.config generated on the fly.

Local run time gives end to end result, while those tests allow me to debug step by step to see what elevalutor really gets from Java driver and how other objects at evaluator side are instantiated.\nEvaluator is an executable and the only input is the evaluator.config. We should have some testing to run it directly, that would help for debugging when needed. We don't want evaluator.config to be hard coded , something created on the fly one would be nice. From this perspective, E2E testing is not a replacement of those tests. \nMy point is we should improve and enhance those tests instead of removing. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/181727156/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/181740948","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/827#issuecomment-181740948","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/827","id":181740948,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MTc0MDk0OA==","user":{"login":"tcNickolas","id":10113024,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTEzMDI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10113024?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas","html_url":"https://github.com/tcNickolas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-09T07:15:29Z","updated_at":"2016-02-09T07:15:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Maybe we should revert this change and file a JIRA to update these tests?
