Also, the file may appear with multiple network locations (either as aliases or as the file is copied to a different systems).  Therefore, I don't think any absolute URL will identify the file under all circumstances, unless it is some kind of special \"place holder\" absolute location.\r\n\r\nAll the XMP examples I've seen so far (which, I admit, isn't _that_ many) have used the empty relative URL as the subject IRI in the RDF graph, when identifying the file.  Therefore, I think it would be best to keep with that convention.\r\n\r\nThis is achievable with `riot`, without needing any changes, by specifying a suitable `--base` command-line option.\r\n\r\nThe RDF/XML output then only needs to be embedded within a `xmpmeta` element and the resulting XML may be used to generate a new PDF that includes this XMP metadata.  These two steps are achievable with existing tools.\r\n\r\nMy thanks to everyone for their comments and help.

all,\r\n\r\nJust to tidy up some loose ends, I've checked the XMP and PDF specifications.\r\n\r\n[XMP part 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adobe/XMP-Toolkit-SDK/main/docs/XMPSpecificationPart1.pdf), section 7.4 (\"rdf:RDF and rdf:Description elements\") says:\r\n> If the XMP data model has an AboutURI (6.1, “XMP packets”), that same URI shall be the value of an\r\nrdf:about attribute in each top-level rdf:Description element. Otherwise, the rdf:about attributes for all top-\r\nlevel rdf:Description elements shall be present with an empty value. The rdf:about attribute shall not be used\r\nin more deeply nested rdf:Description elements.\r\n\r\nXMP part 1 provides very little information about this AboutURI concept beyond identifying it as the `rdf:about` attribute of all top-level `rdf:Description` elements.  Anything more is deemed out-of-scope for the XMP specification. \r\n\r\n[XMP part 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adobe/XMP-Toolkit-SDK/main/docs/XMPSpecificationPart3.pdf) defines how XMP is embedded in various files, including PDF.  For PDF, part 3 gives an overview of how this is done, but also identifies the PDF specification as the authoritative definition on how XMP is embedded.  Part 3 makes no mention of AboutURI.\r\n\r\nI checked [PDF v1.6](https://opensource.adobe.com/dc-acrobat-sdk-docs/pdfstandards/pdfreference1.6.pdf) and this shows how embedded XMP is placed within the definition of the item to which it refers.  These placement rules means the target of the XMP is dictated by the XMP packet's location within of the file.  In addition, the PDF specification makes no mention of AboutURI (which, I think, makes sense).\r\n\r\nAs there is no AboutURI, the RDF/XML (for an RDF graph describing an element within a PDF file) *MUST* contain only top-level `rdf:Description` elements that have a `rdf:about` attribute with an empty value.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1338210853/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1339053542","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/1657#issuecomment-1339053542","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/1657","id":1339053542,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec5P0FXm","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-06T09:51:38Z","updated_at":"2022-12-06T09:51:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"First pass - this looks OK and I hope it will be in 4.7.0.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1339053542/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1339475841","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/1655#issuecomment-1339475841","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/1655","id":1339475841,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec5P1seB","user":{"login":"Aklakan","id":839608,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzOTYwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/839608?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan","html_url":"https://github.com/Aklakan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-06T14:31:50Z","updated_at":"2022-12-06T14:56:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Imho there should also be some optimization for mapping the common query `DISTINCT ?g { GRAPH ?g { ?s ?p ?o } }` (and possibly common variants of it - such as counting distinct graph names) to effectively OpDatasetNames so that the skip scan can be leveraged further.\r\n\r\nFor example,\r\n```sparql\r\nSELECT DISTINCT ?g { GRAPH ?g { ?s ?p ?o } }\r\n```\r\nshould be evaluated efficiently w.r.t. the presence of possibly empty graphs as\r\n```sparql\r\nSELECT ?g {\r\n  GRAPH ?g { }\r\n  FILTER EXISTS { GRAPH ?g { ?s ?p ?o } } # Note: Won't be expand infinitely because\r\n                                          # we are not requesting DISTINCT ?g in the filter element\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOf course this should then be managed as a follow-up issue to this one, but my questions right now are:\r\n* Would it make sense to handle it as a query rewrite (alternatively it could be e.g. part of the OpExecutor but then the logic is less reusable)?\r\n* Where would be the best place for that?
