> What's the order for Pulsar, when we disable forced fsync (and also when its on)?\r\n> \r\n> pulsar's replication mechanism is handled by bookkeeper. bookkeeper is using a parallel replication scheme. with that being said, broker writes the data concurrently to a set of bookies and waiting for a majority (write-quorum-size) of responses coming back before acknowledging the publisher.\r\n> \r\n> so the difference between fsync enabled and fsync disabled is that:\r\n> \r\n> * fsync enabled: bookie sends responses back to brokers when it successfully writes data to filesystem and the data is fsynced to disks.\r\n> * fsync disabled: bookie sends responses back to brokers when it successfully writes data to filesystem.\r\n\r\nI add this link in reaction to this :

seen enough of the pulsar code base yet to make that call) I would even volunteer to implement this, because it is something that I would like to have, as the use case I have started to play with has tens of thousands of topics in a single namespace, i.e. all these topics are subject to multi-topic pattern subscription. And for that, a push notification for topic additions and removals would seem much more lightweight than having to pull, say, 20 thousand topic names every second or so, even when there aren't (m)any

There is an internal exception that is generally not seen by clients called the SessionMovedException. This exception occurs because a request was received on a connection for a session which has be reestablished on a different server. The normal cause of this error is a client that sends a request to a server, but the network packet gets delayed, so the client times out and connects to a new server. When the delayed packet arrives at the first server, the old server detects that the session has moved, and closes the client connection. Clients normally do not see this error since they do not read from those old connections. (Old connections are usually closed.) One situation in which this condition can be seen is when two clients try to reestablish the same connection using a saved session id and password. One of the clients will reestablish the connection and the second client will be disconnected (causing the pair to attempt to re-establish it's connection/session indefinitely).\r\n\r\n(https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.3.5/zookeeperProgrammers.html#ch_zkSessions)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/579083776/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
