I don't have too much comments about it. But I have some other questions from the user perspective:\n1) Shall we set the default log level as `WARN` instead of `INFO` while running the `./bin/spark-sql`, the output seems too verbose for normal user currently.\n2) Shall we provide the default `hive-site.xml.template` and `hive-log4j.properties.template` under the `conf/` too? \n3) I also noticed the package made by `make-distribution.sh`, only contains the assembly jars under the folder `lib`, actually in my cluster, I'd would like to use the SparkSQL with Hive metastore database installed on MySQL, hence I need to put additional jars (mysql driver and datanucleaus) into the folder `lib` manually, but currently, seems I have to change the scripts of `bin/compute-classpath.sh` as well to make those new jars effective in classpath. Not sure if there any better idea for the configuration.\n\nSorry, those questions are not related to this PR.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51294164/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51294371","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1794#issuecomment-51294371","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1794","id":51294371,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMjk0Mzcx","user":{"login":"marmbrus","id":527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus","html_url":"https://github.com/marmbrus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-06T05:08:43Z","updated_at":"2014-08-06T05:08:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"test this please\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51294371/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51294639","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1797#issuecomment-51294639","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1797","id":51294639,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMjk0NjM5","user":{"login":"sarahgerweck","id":3421345,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjEzNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3421345?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarahgerweck","html_url":"https://github.com/sarahgerweck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarahgerweck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarahgerweck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarahgerweck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarahgerweck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarahgerweck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarahgerweck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarahgerweck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarahgerweck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarahgerweck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-06T05:14:33Z","updated_at":"2014-08-06T05:14:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Spark doesn't build anymore.
