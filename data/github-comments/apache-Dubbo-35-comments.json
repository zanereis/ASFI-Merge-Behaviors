for your advice.\r\nThe parameters of execution method of dubbo service are organized by 'Object[]'.such will bring 2 problems:\r\n1.The primitive type are packing and unpacking.\r\n2.Both the primitive  type and the reference type are serialized in the same way.\r\nCode examples:\r\n//method of dubbo sercice\r\npublic String say(String name) {\r\nreturn \"hi:\" + name;\r\n}\r\n//class of parameters  of  dubbo sercice's method,\r\n//it was generated at the time of initialization.\r\nclass TestServiceSayParam$Generate{\r\n         private String name;\r\n         public String

 Exactly sorry for late to reply，I am ill in hospital recently。\r\nI will answer the question you left before，and I want to answer the second question first：\r\n\r\n1. Q：Instead of calculating hashcode of invokers, how about add customized hashcode() for Invoker?\r\nA：In my code，I use the IP address list of invokers to calculate the hash code。Because I think if the providers provide the same interface and the providers list has not changed（maybe shutdown，restart or new startup），the selector is not need to be rebuild。Therefore，if the invokers IP address list or ports has changed（no matter add，reduce and change），the hash code must be changed。Then selector will be rebuild，and hash circle will be changed too\r\n\r\n2. Q：identityhashcode will only change when providers(invokers) change(increase/reduce/override, anything that will cause recreation of invokers), this will trigger the recreation of ConsistentHashSelector, but it won't reschedule the hash circle, the existing invoker will still be in the same position.\r\nA：I‘m sorry that I didn't really understand the fact that when ConsistentHashSelector trigger the recreation, the hash circle won't be rescheduled. When the hashcode of ConsistentHashSelector is different in one invocation, the ConsistentHashSelector will be rebuild. And the virtualInvokers are also rebuild according to the address list of invokers. The address list will be different when such happened. I'm not sure I really understand your question, keep in touch, thx！\r\n\r\n`private <T> int caculateInvokerHashCode(List<Invoker<T>> invokers) {\r\n\t\tStringBuilder metakey = new
