I means heartbeat should not rely on  ACK or NON-ACK, or else.<br/>\n2) the heartbeat design constraint(subprocess is alive but cannot process \"heartbeat\" tuple in time) is always happen. For example: a) if ShellBolt handle one tuple need more time, may exceed the timeout, but it handle other tuples quickly;  b)  currently, the ShellBolt handle one tuple, emit the result, and read all the tuples from stdin to get the id,  read all the tuples from stdin needs long time, which cause exceed timeout.

Packaging creates two new directories named \"extlib\" and \"extlib-daemon\" for holding external jars, and daemons-only external jars, respectively.<br/>\n    2. \"bin/storm\" takes the jars from the above two directories and optional external classpaths, and puts into classpath for launching exec_storm_class (for daemons).<br/>\n    3. In supervisor, when launching a worker, worker-classpath is built from scratch (include extlib but not include extlib-daemon), rather than inherited from supervisor's current-classpath . This is for avoiding classpath leakage from daemons to workers.<br/>\n    Thanks Robert and Naga's comments and proposal.</p>\n\n<p>You can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:</p>\n\n<p>    $ git pull <a href=\"https://github.com/zhuoliu/storm\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/zhuoliu/storm</a> master</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/516.patch\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/516.patch</a></p>\n\n<p>To close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch<br/>\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:</p>\n\n<p>    This closes #516</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>commit 05306d5053ff91bd323c4b54cd246c9f928ca339<br/>\nAuthor: zhuol <zhuol@yahoo-inc.com><br/>\nDate:   2015-04-08T13:57:31Z</p>\n\n<p>    Deal with <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-483\" title=\"extlib for external (contrib and/or 3rd party integration)\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"STORM-483\"><del>STORM-483</del></a> exlib issue</p>\n\n<p>commit c106f1337f84cf7f46be0a133b3bd17b57412d3f<br/>\nAuthor: zhuol <zhuol@yahoo-inc.com><br/>\nDate:   2015-04-08T14:03:42Z</p>\n\n<p>    Merge remote-tracking branch 'apache/master'</p>\n\n<hr />","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612488161/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/90938279","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/511#issuecomment-90938279","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/511","id":90938279,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDkwOTM4Mjc5","user":{"login":"harshach","id":38649,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NjQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38649?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach","html_url":"https://github.com/harshach","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-08T14:48:58Z","updated_at":"2015-04-08T14:48:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/90938279/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
