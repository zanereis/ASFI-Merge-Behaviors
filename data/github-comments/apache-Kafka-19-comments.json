I think that can be a broker config since it's only applicable to the brokers.\n\nAlso, I just realized that we never did a KIP on enabling ZK security in Kafka.

I ran a sample application that makes two KafkaConsumers. Here's what jconsole shows me:\n\n```\nkafka.consumer\n| app-info\n  | consumer-1\n    | Attributes\n      | ...\n  | consumer-2\n    | Attributes\n      | ...\n| consumer-coordinator-metrics\n  | consumer-1\n    | Attributes\n      | heartbeat-rate\n      | ...\n  | consumer-2\n    | Attributes\n      |  heartbeat-rate\n      |  ...\n| consumer-fetch-manager-metrics\n  | consumer-1\n    | Attributes\n      | ...\n  | consumer-2\n    | Attributes\n      | ...\n| consumer-metrics\n  | consumer-1\n    | Attributes\n      | ...\n  | consumer-2\n    | Attributes\n      | ...\n| consumer-node-metrics\n  | consumer-1\n    | node--1\n      | Attributes\n        | ...\n    | ...\n  | consumer-2\n    | node--1\n      | Attributes\n        | ...\n    | ...\n| metrics-stats\n  | Attributes\n    | metrics-total\n```\n\nBasically, metrics-stats isn't scoped to a client-id while the others were. I think what ends up happening is the two clients might be writing their own metrics count to the same metrics-total mbean. So if one consumer had x metrics while another consumer had y metrics, the metrics-total could for instance jump back forth between x and y.\n\nBelow is the same application:\n\n``` java\n/**\n * Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more contributor license agreements.
