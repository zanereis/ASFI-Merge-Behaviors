Locating this in the \"New project\" dialog is odd and the last place I would look for modifying an existing project.\r\n> \r\n> If we want to get this in fast and now, then I suggest to make this an entry in the \"Tools\" menu. From a UX perspective though, I would prefer integration through the hint interface, as this nicely aligns with general cleanup and platform updates.\r\n\r\n@matthiasblaesing Honestly, tools menu isn't much better IMO - its also not a place where I look for refactoring tasks. The implementation right now is separate from everything and not intrusive, I would be ok with integrating it as experimental feature, it seems like there is interest to properly integrate it at some point in future. (But my initial reaction was similar to yours)\r\n\r\nThe module has no public API (I removed that export), so we could remove it in future again if there is no interest to improve it. It could be extracted to a plugin (plugin portal) for example in that case.\r\n\r\nThis could be even delivered as maven hint, since it could directly annotate the dependency in the pom, replace it, then run the transformation.\r\n\r\nWe could of course also move this to NB 20, but the feature does work - maybe someone will find it useful in its early stage.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1635694324/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1635786412","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/5640#issuecomment-1635786412","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5640","id":1635786412,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5hgB6s","user":{"login":"junichi11","id":738383,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczODM4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/738383?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11","html_url":"https://github.com/junichi11","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-14T12:22:30Z","updated_at":"2023-07-14T12:24:19Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@qmegas \r\nPlease use the code completion for `include` and `require`.

The latter is itself a bug, because the cache directory is not supposed to contain absolute paths (we know this since @jtulach once wrote a testCachesDontUseAbsolutePaths test).\r\n2) The fix to the underlying bug in (1) would be to eliminate the absolute paths, but I looked into that and couldn't figure out how.\r\n3) This PR takes a different approach: Just make sure the cache directory gets invalidated whenever the installation path changes. I think that's a good idea in any case; moving the install directory is a rare occurrence, except maybe if running from a USB drive where drive letters change or such.\r\n4) As it happens, this PR itself fails the testCachesDontUseAbsolutePaths test because the invalidation is done by adding the absolute install path to the all-checksum.txt file. But I can just make it pass by allowing that particular occurrence of the absolute path, in all-checksum.txt only.\r\n\r\nUnless @jtulach disagrees, my inclination here would be to fix the failing test by adjusting testCachesDontUseAbsolutePaths  to allow the absolute path in all-checksum.txt .\r\n\r\nThe main possible objection here would be in giving up the \"feature\" of being able to move the NetBeans install directory without invalidating the cache directory. (I think that's acceptable, in return for eliminating a whole class of bugs that make NetBeans permanently un-startable.)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1640373414/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
