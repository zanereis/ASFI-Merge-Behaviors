I was not aware that the template dirs would be out of the current existing TVM Python packages. How is the code in 'apps' handled currently in general? Would it make sense have another package just for the templates and add it as a dependency when on installs the other TVM packages? Or even leave the package install as optional and `tvmc`  would warn the user about it being absent (not installed) - current `tvmc micro` allows two ways to specify the template dirs: 1) by project type (passing `-t zephyr` or `-t arduino`, for instance), and 2) passing a `PATH` to a template dir. Option 1.  is where TVMC can detect the missing server in the default template dirs and warn the user, saying the user can install the optional package or go for using option 2., in case the template dirs are in ad hoc location.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/895298535/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/895322905","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/8690#issuecomment-895322905","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8690","id":895322905,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM41XYsZ","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-09T15:32:06Z","updated_at":"2021-08-09T15:32:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hmm, that failing test is parametrized to include `float16`, but the failing case was using `float32` values.

We can definitely start with just `docs` for now to see how this works--if we expand the approach to `tutorials`, i think there are a few more wrinkles.\r\n\r\nThe main question is whether we can reliably reproduce the results of the CI on GH actions. Since the underlying machine will vary, and tutorials are executed as TVM code during the docs build, I favor to keep everything centralized (otherwise tutorials might output different results than you see on CI). On the other hand, I understand that if we're just limiting to `docs` changes, running Sphinx should produce the same warnings regardless of the host CUDA driver version and attached GPU hardware.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/895335274/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/895336950","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8380#issuecomment-895336950","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8380","id":895336950,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM41XcH2","user":{"login":"areusch","id":532957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/532957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch","html_url":"https://github.com/areusch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-09T15:51:36Z","updated_at":"2021-08-09T15:51:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@gromero right now we haven't broadly addressed data dependencies in the wheel. i think we need to at some point build a central e.g. `tvm.utils.get_packaged_resource(\"...\")` function to mimic `tvm.micro.get_standalone_crt_dir` (and use the former internally in the latter). this will allow us to add arbitrary data dependencies to the wheel and refer to their paths later on.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/895336950/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/895341780","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8382#issuecomment-895341780","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8382","id":895341780,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM41XdTU","user":{"login":"areusch","id":532957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/532957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch","html_url":"https://github.com/areusch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-09T15:58:21Z","updated_at":"2021-08-09T15:58:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mikepapadim @tqchen @junrushao1994 i'd still like us to use the `ci-lint` image to invoke each of these checks. doing this will ensure that the output of the pre-commit hook exactly matches the CI (or has the best chance of doing so). the best way to do this is with:\r\n`docker/lint.sh <check_name>`\r\n\r\nthere is one wrinkle with this approach--it will fail spectacularly when you are inside a `git-worktree` other than your original git repo. @Lunderberg is resolving this limitation with #8670.\r\n\r\ndo you mind changing the command line to `docker/lint.sh` for the pre-commit steps?

And in general do we want to maintain TOPI definitions for both CUDA and GPU, or rename it all to GPU, to show that it encompasses more than just Nvidia backends? That would I believe be the topic of a larger RFC.\r\n\r\n@echuraev could you confirm that making those changes to the schedule templates doesn't lead to regressions on the CUDA codegen on Nvidia GPUs?

If we allow every op to have 1e-4 then it's possible to hurt the accuracy eventually especially when the graph is large. That's why I would prefer to know the specific case that we really have no way but can only use 1e-4.
