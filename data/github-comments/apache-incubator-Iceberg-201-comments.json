@rizaon I think this is getting real close now (thanks for sticking with us on this).  Now that we've gotten this far, I see there's a little more we can do to consolidate the logic in ContentCache.  For example, if you pull the property configuration into ContentCache constructor, we can remove a lot from ManifestFiles.  For example:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n public ContentCache(FileIO fileio) {\r\n    this.fileio = fileio;\r\n\r\n    long expireAfterAccessMs = PropertyUtil.propertyAsLong(\r\n        fileio.properties(),\r\n        CatalogProperties.IO_MANIFEST_CACHE_EXPIRATION_INTERVAL_MS,\r\n        CatalogProperties.IO_MANIFEST_CACHE_EXPIRATION_INTERVAL_MS_DEFAULT);\r\n\r\n    long maxTotalBytes = PropertyUtil.propertyAsLong(\r\n        fileio.properties(),\r\n        CatalogProperties.IO_MANIFEST_CACHE_MAX_TOTAL_BYTES,\r\n        CatalogProperties.IO_MANIFEST_CACHE_MAX_TOTAL_BYTES_DEFAULT);\r\n\r\n    long maxContentLength = PropertyUtil.propertyAsLong(\r\n        fileio.properties(),\r\n        CatalogProperties.IO_MANIFEST_CACHE_MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH,\r\n        CatalogProperties.IO_MANIFEST_CACHE_MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH_DEFAULT);\r\n\r\n    ValidationException.check(expireAfterAccessMs >= 0, \"expireAfterAccessMs is less than 0\");\r\n    ValidationException.check(maxTotalBytes > 0, \"maxTotalBytes is equal or less than 0\");\r\n    ValidationException.check(maxContentLength > 0, \"maxContentLength is equal or less than 0\");\r\n    this.expireAfterAccessMs = expireAfterAccessMs;\r\n    this.maxTotalBytes = maxTotalBytes;\r\n    this.maxContentLength = maxContentLength;\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also pull `CONTENT_CACHES`, `contentCache(FileIO io)`, and `dropCache(FileIO fileIO)` into `ContentCache` as well.\r\n\r\nI played around with moving more of the logic into `ContentCache` and was able to move everything (minus the `newInputFile`) logic into ContentCache, which I feel is a cleaner separation of concerns.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1256455762/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1256480398","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4518#issuecomment-1256480398","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4518","id":1256480398,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85K5F6O","user":{"login":"rizaon","id":6033430,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMzM0MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6033430?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rizaon","html_url":"https://github.com/rizaon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rizaon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rizaon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rizaon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rizaon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rizaon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rizaon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rizaon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rizaon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rizaon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-23T17:32:38Z","updated_at":"2022-09-23T17:32:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @danielcweeks that looks like a nice cleanup.

But in Hive test mode, client and server version should be matched, so once it finds a variable (operation type?) is set, but the value is `DataOperationType.UNSET`, it means the value is not set properly so it will throw an exception. But in our case, the reason doesn't apply.\r\n\r\nI just checked some other Hive code like https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/50fff5a3962d662e1b00287a1f5f6e8d3283523f/iceberg/iceberg-handler/src/test/java/org/apache/iceberg/mr/hive/TestHiveShell.java#L214.\r\n\r\nIt may be more accurate?\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    // set to false so that TxnManager#checkLock does not throw exception when using UNSET data type operation\r\n    // in the requested lock component\r\n    hiveConf.setBoolVar(HiveConf.ConfVars.HIVE_IN_TEST, false);\r\n```\r\n\r\nSomehow I'm not familiar with Hive internal though.

@wypoon, we can put the new test case in the class like `TestPositionFilter`, in that case, it is easier to modify the threshold, and we don't have to touch any thing related to Spark.\r\n\r\n@flyrain I don't think `TestPositionFilter` is the right place for testing the code path that is not exercised by existing tests. What I want to test is that the custom metric I added in #4588 produces the correct count of deletes applied, when using the streaming delete filter. E.g., I want to check `TestSparkReaderDeletes#testMixedPosAndEqDeletesWithDeletedColumn` passes when the streaming delete filter is used.\r\nI think the best way is still to run `TestSparkReaderDeletes` but with the threshold to use the streaming delete filter set to a low number from the test.\r\nI'll explore the system property approach, unless you have another suggestion.

This part of logic should cover the case you mentioned. \r\n\r\n```\r\n    long minDataSequenceNumber =\r\n        filtered.stream()\r\n            .map(ManifestFile::minSequenceNumber)\r\n            .filter(\r\n                seq ->\r\n                    seq\r\n                        != ManifestWriter\r\n                            .UNASSIGNED_SEQ) // filter out unassigned in rewritten manifests\r\n            .reduce(base.lastSequenceNumber(), Math::min);\r\n    deleteFilterManager.dropDeleteFilesOlderThan(minDataSequenceNumber);\r\n    List<ManifestFile> filteredDeletes =\r\n        deleteFilterManager.filterManifests(\r\n            base.schema(), snapshot != null ? snapshot.deleteManifests(ops.io()) : null);\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut some data files may not match the deletes, those data files will not be rewritten and will hold the sequence number unchanged. In that case, the delete files will not be removed.\r\n\r\nAdding `min-seq-num` is mainly for performance consideration. When planning the task, the `min-seq-num` can help to filter out more unrelated deletes upon the min/max filter. Consider a flink upsert case with four snapshots: \r\n\r\n`(f1) -> (f2) -> (f3) -> (f4, d1)` \r\n\r\nThe delete file `d1` is intended to apply to `f4` data file only but it may apply to all files since the min/max filter cannot always filter out unrelated data files upon the file name pattern \"$partitionId-$taskId-$UUID-$fileCount\". Though we can optimize the pattern by moving `$UUID` to the end or adding a `$timestamp` after `$partitionid`, it only helps the position deletes.\r\n\r\nAnother benefit is reducing conflict when compacting, the `min-seq-num` could help to narrow down the conflict scope.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1256829898/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1256840876","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/5844#issuecomment-1256840876","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/5844","id":1256840876,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85K6d6s","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-24T02:52:05Z","updated_at":"2022-09-24T02:52:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I think that adding this config is much simpler?
