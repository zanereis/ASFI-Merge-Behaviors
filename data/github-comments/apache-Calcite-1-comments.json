Pls see the following response. \n\n(I squash the two commits into one. Not sure if that's OK or not for the pull request).\n\n1 . In misc.oq, a field that was called \"DESC\" is now called \"EXPR$1\". Can you restore the old name?\n\n[jni]  I guess you are talking about the JdbcTest.testInnerJoinValues(), where \"DESC\" is changed to \"EXPR$1\".  \n\nActually, the field name change happens only in EXPLAIN PLAN output;  the query result is still using \"DESC\".  I spent quite some time trying to figure out why the field name is changed in EXPLAIN.  I do not have a completely clear idea why it happened. But seems Calcite put two RelNodes with different rowType under the same RelSet.   The following is from the calcite trace \"before\" my code change: \n\nSet#1, type: RecordType(INTEGER EXPR$0, CHAR(8) EXPR$1)\n  rel#11:Subset#1.NONE.[], best=null, importance=0.5904900000000001\n    rel#1:LogicalValues.NONE.[[0, 1], [1]](type=RecordType%28INTEGER EXPR$0, CHAR%288%29 EXPR$1%29,tuples=[{ 10, 'SameName' }]), rowcount=1.0, cumulative cost={inf}\n    rel#12:LogicalProject.NONE.[[0, 1], [1]](input=rel#11:Subset#1.NONE.[],ID=$0,DESC=$1), rowcount=1.0, cumulative cost={inf}\n\nIn the above, the LogicalValues has (EXPR$0, EXPR$1), LogicalProject has (ID, DESC). Yet Calcite still put them together under the same RelSet.  My guess is CALCITE-457 patch will impact the order of some rules firing, and somehow the rowType of downstream RelNode is messed up.\n\nOn the other hand, I think Calcite's API does not guarantee that the intermediate RelNode will keep the same field name;  the output field name is ensured to be same via validator.getValidatedNodeType(). That's why the query result still has \"DESC\" in the output. Therefore, I feel it might be ok to have different field name in the EXPLAIN plan output.\n\nAnother comment : this testcase does not have the join condition pushed. That's simply because of costing.  Values() has one row only.  I tried with two rows, and verified the condition will be pushed. \n1. It's appropriate to always create a LogicalJoin when in SqlToRelConverter, less so in general-purpose planner rules. Can you use a join factory and not add method RelOptUtil.createJoin?\n\n[jni] \nI tried to add join factory to FilterJoinRule, that seems require more change.  In stead, I chose to passing in originalJoin, and use join.copy() method. That way, in the general-purpose planner rule or SqlToRelConverter, the new created Join will be of the same class of original join node. \n1. [jni] Now I pass in param originalJoin. No need for such format.  \n2. join.oq should end with newline\n   [jni]  Done. \n3. Can you add a test for FilterJoinRule's new capability to RelOptRulesTest.\n   [jni] testPushJoinCondDownToProject() is Added.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/111309699/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/111644866","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/94#issuecomment-111644866","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/94","id":111644866,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExMTY0NDg2Ng==","user":{"login":"julianhyde","id":1130553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzA1NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1130553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde","html_url":"https://github.com/julianhyde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-13T00:05:54Z","updated_at":"2015-06-13T00:05:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This change is by Venki Korukanti, correct?
