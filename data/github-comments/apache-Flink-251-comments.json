I tried to convert the List  to an Array in **AvroRowDeserializationSchema**, but to make the conversion generic an **Object []** must be returned, which would then lead to a cast problem when passing the **Object []** to **TypeSerializer.copy()**.\r\n\r\nI tried using **ListTypeInfo** to declare corresponding Avro array type, it was just working fine, as we already have **ListSerializer** to support it. Hence I thought it would be better expose ListTypeInfo explicitly in Table types. Please let me know if I missed anything.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/395134156/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/395237853","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6089#issuecomment-395237853","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6089","id":395237853,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NTIzNzg1Mw==","user":{"login":"medcv","id":9163132,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxNjMxMzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9163132?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/medcv","html_url":"https://github.com/medcv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/medcv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/medcv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/medcv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/medcv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/medcv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/medcv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/medcv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/medcv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/medcv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-06T22:46:38Z","updated_at":"2018-06-06T22:46:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@zentol Thanks for the review.

You should probably ask the guys maintaining your hadoop `2.7.0-xxx` to converge those dependencies (for example pin `commons-lang` to 2.6 and `libthrift` to 0.9), otherwise bad things can happen randomly.  \r\n\r\nI'm not sure how could the solution on Flink side look like. @zentol maybe as we discussed previously, we could provide build profiles for some set of supported by us hadoop versions. But is there a mechanism for user to provide a custom build profile for his own custom hadoop version that solves the convergence in `flink-shaded-hadoop2`?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/395337157/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/395337477","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6135#issuecomment-395337477","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6135","id":395337477,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NTMzNzQ3Nw==","user":{"login":"sihuazhou","id":7480427,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0ODA0Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7480427?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou","html_url":"https://github.com/sihuazhou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-07T08:29:01Z","updated_at":"2018-06-07T08:29:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"cc

I ran your code on my local and it did work perfectly. I could see some checkstyle errors that I think travis might pick them up. \r\n\r\nI have a suggestion for the sake of example scenario. \r\nFor the `alerts` event you using `LocalTime` which indicate when `alerts` occurred, it would be useful also add `warnings` timestamp to `alerts` event in order to show when racks temperature passed the threshold, something like this on [line](https://github.com/kisimple/flink/blob/5cd3a374b84b2a7aaedb4c4184caded073e19295/flink-examples/flink-examples-cep/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/cep/examples/java/monitoring/TemperatureMonitoring.java#L133)\r\n \r\n`out.collect(new TemperatureAlert(first.getRackID(), second.getDatetime()));\r\n`\r\n\r\nof course it needs to update the `TemperatureAlert` model also.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/395620455/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/395630527","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6140#issuecomment-395630527","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6140","id":395630527,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NTYzMDUyNw==","user":{"login":"zjffdu","id":164491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu","html_url":"https://github.com/zjffdu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-08T02:55:32Z","updated_at":"2018-06-08T02:55:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tillrohrmann  Could you help review it ?
