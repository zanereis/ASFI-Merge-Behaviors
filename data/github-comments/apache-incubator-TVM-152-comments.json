For example, you compile one compiled cuda model before this change and export to `deploy_old.so`, you could load `deploy_old.so` in the new runtime (merged this change). However, if you compile one model using new runtime (merged this change) and export to `deploy_new.so`, which can not be loaded into old runtime (before this change). Because we will write `_lib` for LLVM mod / write `_import_tree` for constructing model import relationship. Your refer issue is to use new runtime to export library, but loaded into old runtime (DLR), so you can not find `_lib` loader and `_import_tree`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/569876738/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/569959460","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/4508#issuecomment-569959460","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4508","id":569959460,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2OTk1OTQ2MA==","user":{"login":"anijain2305","id":13822661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODIyNjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13822661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305","html_url":"https://github.com/anijain2305","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-31T17:03:01Z","updated_at":"2019-12-31T17:03:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@pyalex This is fixed.

Because I have no experience in Relay at all, I would appreciate it if you can resolve these questions:\r\n\r\n1. I was thinking about AAM has the power to unify CFA with a wide range of DFA. It is very tempting but considering the current application area of Relay. I am considering Relay more like a \"glue\" language that able to perform graph level optimization; which means there won't be any \"computationally intensive\" piece of code written in Relay. That brings me the question -- what is the benefit of designing a general analysis infrastructure if it won't affect the performance (since the computational heavy part is not written in Relay)? You already have several analyses scattered around. Other than refactoring and giving a better, clean and maintainable developing environment, is there an urgent or short-term benefit to do that? \r\n\r\n2. Is there a benefit of adapting CFA in the context of Relay? In this post(#3895) I see you considering an example trying to combine pointer analysis with CFA, is that just for demonstration or that is a real requirement that can help the performance of Relay? I was thinking CFA will be very helpful in the context of Scheme because each function is very small, and CFA can hugely increase the precision of the Dataflow Analysis. However, in the official tutorial, the function in Relay [seems really big](https://docs.tvm.ai/tutorials/relay_quick_start.html#sphx-glr-tutorials-relay-quick-start-py). In that context, CFA doesn't seem to help the precision of DFA a lot; while my limited Functional Programming experience cannot come up with an example that CFA itself can help (something like devirtualization in C++ or inlining the callee). Could you give an example where CFA can help Relay code?\r\n\r\n3. I am currently still learning AAM. If I understand correctly, even using AAM requires the definition of the abstract domain and the definition of abstract transfer function separately for different analyses. What's more, I currently have doubts about expressing backward analysis and live variable analysis using AAM. I can only find the related post [(mentioned at the very end)](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~horwitz/CS704-NOTES/10.ABSTRACT-INTERPRETATION.html) using abstract interpretation to define live variable analysis. This makes me wonder if AAM can subsume the general dataflow monotone framework. Could you give some references for using AAM to implement all kinds of analysis? \r\n\r\nGreat Thanks, and Happy New Year! :) \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/570014781/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/570019324","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4606#issuecomment-570019324","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4606","id":570019324,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MDAxOTMyNA==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-01T04:14:53Z","updated_at":"2020-01-01T04:17:52Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"cc @icemelon9 @yzhliu @Hzfengsy @ZihengJiang @wweic ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/570019324/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/570034759","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/4468#issuecomment-570034759","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4468","id":570034759,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MDAzNDc1OQ==","user":{"login":"MarisaKirisame","id":3397377,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzOTczNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3397377?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame","html_url":"https://github.com/MarisaKirisame","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-01T08:47:12Z","updated_at":"2020-01-01T08:47:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@DKXXXL\r\n1. while it is true that tensor is the bottleneck, the high level code dictate what tensor will get computed. For example, you can do dead code elimination to remove unnecessary tensor operation(this is a real need rn), or deforestation(which require an effect analysis) to make tensor operation into one graph, which can then be further optimize by all graph-level pass. right now, we have dead code elimination but it is simply incorrect - it assume there is no effect, and @jroesch need it fixed.\r\n2. I dont think there is much value in CFA. However, we do need pointer analysis because the AD pass create reference (including reference of a closure that modify reference) everywhere, and AAM bring pointer analysis for free.\r\n3. Again, AAM bring pointer analysis for free because AAM map every variable to a location (which is what pointer analysis do). Also dataflow framework do not do closure, or we will stick with it. For backward analysis, I dont see a problem: the idea of AAM is to map every variable to a finite location, and you can do you backward transition on those locations just similarly.\r\nHappy new year!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/570034759/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/570038131","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4604#issuecomment-570038131","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4604","id":570038131,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MDAzODEzMQ==","user":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-01T09:43:11Z","updated_at":"2020-01-01T09:43:11Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks @optima2005 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/570038131/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/570086544","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4511#issuecomment-570086544","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4511","id":570086544,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MDA4NjU0NA==","user":{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-01T21:54:25Z","updated_at":"2020-01-01T21:54:40Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@optima2005 could you rebase again?

It will, e.g. make attribute not special anymore, become first class citizen so one can very easily define function in tvm that basically call another function. right now it is not possible unless you do it in C++, because you have to fill out typerelation and do dispatching yourself there.\r\n@jroesch ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/570750060/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/570751412","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/4617#issuecomment-570751412","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4617","id":570751412,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MDc1MTQxMg==","user":{"login":"MarisaKirisame","id":3397377,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzOTczNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3397377?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame","html_url":"https://github.com/MarisaKirisame","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-04T03:07:23Z","updated_at":"2020-01-04T03:07:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3397377/71759044-33412e00-2e5c-11ea-94a9-5cbf75b16c5a.png)\r\n\r\nmaybe some name that has connection to relay is good?\r\nAxon seems quite nice: it is literally under relay, it is brain-related, it is short.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/570751412/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":1,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/570751671","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4615#issuecomment-570751671","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4615","id":570751671,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MDc1MTY3MQ==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-04T03:11:22Z","updated_at":"2020-01-04T03:11:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@MarisaKirisame I think we could bring a separate discuss thread in the forum for the type system design.
