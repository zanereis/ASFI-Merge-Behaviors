When I test locally mac environment, pulsar-client shows that the installation was successful, but when I use `import pulsar`, it will cause the program to exit. I think in the dashboard, an option can be set to let the user decide whether to turn on parsing batch messages, this allows users to use dashboard even if pulsar-client is not installed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/523374782/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/523389300","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/4626#issuecomment-523389300","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/4626","id":523389300,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMzM4OTMwMA==","user":{"login":"yittg","id":4429171,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MjkxNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4429171?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yittg","html_url":"https://github.com/yittg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yittg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yittg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yittg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yittg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yittg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yittg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yittg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yittg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yittg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-21T10:02:02Z","updated_at":"2019-08-21T10:29:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@sijie Anyone is working on this? i would like to take it if not.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/523389300/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/523394292","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/4992#issuecomment-523394292","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/4992","id":523394292,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMzM5NDI5Mg==","user":{"login":"yittg","id":4429171,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MjkxNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4429171?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yittg","html_url":"https://github.com/yittg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yittg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yittg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yittg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yittg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yittg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yittg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yittg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yittg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yittg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-21T10:17:02Z","updated_at":"2019-08-21T10:17:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tuteng \r\n> But there are some issues about parsing batch messages.
