Major changes are:\n1. The way cancellation is handled. AbstractJobLauncher now has a default implementation of cancelJob that simply sets the flag cancellationRequested (which is volatile boolean), which indicates that cancellation is requested. Then the method will wait (with timeout) on a object named cancellationLock on which notify will be called once the cancellation is successfully executed. No explicit synchronization is needed for cancellationRequested since it is volatile boolean. The responsibility of executing the cancellation is done by a single-thread scheduled thread pool executor named `cancellationExecutor`, which periodically checks if the flag `cancellationRequested` is set and calls a method `executeCancellation` to actually execute the cancellation if the flag is set. If the cancellation is successfully executed, another flag `cancellationExecuted` is set so the `cancellationExecutor` will do a noop if the cancellation has already been executed. The execution of cancellation and setting of the `cancellationExecuted` flag, as well as the check of the flag `cancellationExecuted` in the 'JobLauncher' implementations, are synchronized on `cancellationExecutor` (used as a lock).\n2. Added a new class JobContext that contains all context information of a job. This simplifies AbstractJobLauncher.\n3. Added a new method `shutdownExecutorService` in `ExecutorUtils` and used it in the code base.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/99995995/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/100362240","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/119#issuecomment-100362240","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/119","id":100362240,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwMDM2MjI0MA==","user":{"login":"ibuenros","id":1364112,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQxMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1364112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros","html_url":"https://github.com/ibuenros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-08T20:57:09Z","updated_at":"2015-05-08T20:57:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Addressed.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/100362240/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/100399806","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/120#issuecomment-100399806","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/120","id":100399806,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwMDM5OTgwNg==","user":{"login":"sahilTakiar","id":1282583,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODI1ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1282583?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar","html_url":"https://github.com/sahilTakiar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-09T00:35:48Z","updated_at":"2015-05-09T00:35:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM.

Before, I believe there was 1 task per partition per topic, so the job was parallelized based on partitions, i.e. if there are 10 partitions, there could be 10 different threads pulling from Kafka. Is this now a sequential process?\n\nIn the old way (where there was one extractor per partition per topic), we basically wrote this module: https://github.com/linkedin/gobblin/blob/c71a32875a97386d0214dbece53559ccdf8cd875/gobblin-core/src/main/java/gobblin/publisher/BatchKafkaData.java\nwhich can get called from the publisher and basically batches together all kafka data for a given topic. This way, the extractors can still run in parallel, but the data gets batched at the publish step.\n\nIs there a reason the design decision was made to sequentially pull all partitions in a topic?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/103669066/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/103679337","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/139#issuecomment-103679337","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/139","id":103679337,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwMzY3OTMzNw==","user":{"login":"ibuenros","id":1364112,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQxMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1364112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros","html_url":"https://github.com/ibuenros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-19T21:56:03Z","updated_at":"2015-05-19T21:56:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/103679337/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/103679739","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/135#issuecomment-103679739","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/135","id":103679739,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwMzY3OTczOQ==","user":{"login":"zliu41","id":6342538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNDI1Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6342538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41","html_url":"https://github.com/zliu41","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-19T21:58:18Z","updated_at":"2015-05-19T21:58:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@akshayn1107 Not all partitions of a topic go to the same workunit/extractor, it depends on the number of mappers (`mr.job.max.mappers`). If that number is more than a third of the total number of partitions, then most likely each workunit will still have only one partition.\n\nIf the number of mappers is very small compared to the number of partitions (in our use case we use 200 mappers for 5000+ partitions), then we try to assign partitions of the same topic to the same workunit, so that these partitions can share output files. This helps reduce the number of small files generated.\n\nThe number of workunits/extractors is no less than 3x number of mappers. We use `workUnitMaxSize = total size of all partitions / num of mappers / 3`\nIf the total size of all partitions of a topic is smaller than workUnitMaxSize, all of them go to the same workunit. Otherwise, they go to different workunits via bin packing.\n\nLet me know if this works for
