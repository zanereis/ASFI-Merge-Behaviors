If you want to use it, you can still use it. \r\n\r\nYou can use the schema restful API to create/retrieve/update the schema: http://pulsar.apache.org/admin-rest-api/?version=2.5.0#operation/postSchema\r\n\r\nWhat you need is just write a Kafka serializer and deserializer to use Pulsar schema library. We did a similar thing that wraps Kafka serializer and deserializer into a Pulsar schema. You just need to do the reverse thing - wrap Pulsar schema into Kafka serializer and deserializer.\r\n\r\nI am attaching one example for your reference - https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pulsar-client-kafka-compat/pulsar-client-kafka/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/client/kafka/compat/PulsarKafkaSchema.java","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/609947991/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/609949408","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/6335#issuecomment-609949408","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/6335","id":609949408,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwOTk0OTQwOA==","user":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-06T18:03:28Z","updated_at":"2020-04-06T18:03:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@david-streamlio sorry for the late response. @jiazhai @codelipenghui and @gaoran10 can you guys review this pull request? @david-streamlio is waiting for a review.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/609949408/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/609949865","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/6514#issuecomment-609949865","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/6514","id":609949865,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwOTk0OTg2NQ==","user":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-06T18:04:19Z","updated_at":"2020-04-06T18:04:19Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@russorat you are welcome!
