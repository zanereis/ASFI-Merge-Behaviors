We really need this algorithm in the library!\nI have a few comments:\n- we should clarify what is the expected input graph format and the output. If I'm not mistaken, it seems you're expecting a directed graph without edge duplicates and you count triangles ignoring edge direction. Is that correct? I would add a clear comment in the usage description about that. If we want to do this even better, we could even add a graph validator for the input.\n- I'm not quite sure what happens when the graph has opposite direction edges, i.e. a->b and b->a, that are both part of a triangle. I would expect that this triangle would be counted twice, but it seems to me that you're only counting it once. Is there a reason for that?\n- as you've been experimenting with this for a while, could you let us know how better is this than your vertex-centric version? Is it always the case?

Sadly, they are using sbt for building their project.\nSpark doesn't deploy its _2.11 artifacts to maven central.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/134658771/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/134663435","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1043#issuecomment-134663435","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1043","id":134663435,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNDY2MzQzNQ==","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-25T16:33:11Z","updated_at":"2015-08-25T16:33:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@fhueske Added the test you requested.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/134663435/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/134665239","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1043#issuecomment-134665239","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1043","id":134665239,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNDY2NTIzOQ==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-25T16:38:25Z","updated_at":"2015-08-25T16:38:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks!

The graph should be undirected. Without the distinct, you get duplicate edges there(and an erroneous number of triangles). The second bullet point is again not an issue because the graph is undirected. \nThe result should be fine. For the SNAP data sets, I got a number equal to theirs on a cluster.\n\nConcerning the runtime, you are right, It's just true for some cases (generally faster by a factor of two) but it highly depends on the data set. So, once this gets merged, I'll go ahead and propose the vertex centric version as well. That way, the user can choose. \n\nHope I clarified everything!\nLet me know if you still have questions :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/134702560/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/134720344","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1054#issuecomment-134720344","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1054","id":134720344,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNDcyMDM0NA==","user":{"login":"vasia","id":498957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5ODk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/498957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia","html_url":"https://github.com/vasia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-25T19:56:59Z","updated_at":"2015-08-25T19:56:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the clarifications Andra!
