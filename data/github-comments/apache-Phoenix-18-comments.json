Server PTable doesn't replace the client PTable in the cache, only updates the ddl timestamp field in the client-side PTable.

@kadirozde overall looks like a great improvement. I have added a few comments. Some questions:\r\n> \r\n> 1. Is it more beneficial to have paging based on row size rather than number of rows, since each row can be arbitrarily large?\r\n> 2. Server-side pagination will help _reduce_ the chance of the race conditions mentioned in the Jira description, but does not aim at eliminating them, correct?\r\n> 3. Though this is aimed at such race conditions related to mutations (server-side UPSERT SELECT/DELETE), it seems like it will also affect the normal read path for non-Group_By aggregate queries. Is there any negative effect/extra slowness during reads due to this pagination, and if yes, do we want to make sure that changes only affect the write paths?\r\n> \r\n> Let's also please add some tests for this.\r\n\r\n1. Not sure about it but we can introduce additional constraints like the total size of scanned bytes as you suggested to further improve this feature later. \r\n2. This is correct. By itself, it does not eliminate. However, the client can wait for all the page operation to complete or fail before returning to the application, as an additional improvement. This will further reduce the race conditions. I think we have to enforce the client side timestamp to make the race almost impossible.\r\n3. I expect this feature will improve the overall performance and availability since paging limits the memory usage and the time to hold server resources. My experience with paging on a real cluster is very positive.  I have not seen any negative impact yet as long as the page size is not very small (e.g., less than 1000).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/724872173/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/724939657","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/phoenix/pull/960#issuecomment-724939657","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/960","id":724939657,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyNDkzOTY1Nw==","user":{"login":"stoty","id":304757,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDc1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/304757?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty","html_url":"https://github.com/stoty","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-10T20:11:37Z","updated_at":"2020-11-10T20:11:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":":broken_heart: **-1 overall**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n| Vote | Subsystem | Runtime | Comment |\r\n|:----:|----------:|--------:|:--------|\r\n| +0 :ok: |  reexec  |   5m 33s |  Docker mode activated.  |\r\n||| _ Prechecks _ |\r\n| +1 :green_heart: |  dupname  |   0m  0s |  No case conflicting files found.  |\r\n| +1 :green_heart: |  hbaseanti  |   0m  0s |  Patch does not have any anti-patterns.  |\r\n| +1 :green_heart: |  @author  |   0m  0s |  The patch does not contain any @author tags.  |\r\n| -1 :x: |  test4tests  |   0m  0s |  The patch doesn't appear to include any new or modified tests.

This feature requires a 4.16 client and a 4.16 server. The server code is intended to gracefully no-op and not annotate if the client hasn't provided anything. \r\n2. The question would be how to store the list of tables to annotate, since so much of the logic is client-side where we don't have the server-side hbase-site.xml. It could be Yet Another PTable Attribute, but I'm unsure if it's worth the complexity -- wdyt? The conceptually cleanest way would be to annotate replicated tables and not annotate unreplicated ones, but replication scope is on the TableDescriptor, which we don't usually have access to client-side. \r\n\r\nA critique I received offline to this PR from @priyankporwal suggested that annotating indexes might not be worth the storage cost, so we could also consider exempting indexes in the next draft (which is waiting on PHOENIX-6186 to populate the DDL timestamps)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/725058655/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/725061732","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/phoenix/pull/961#issuecomment-725061732","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/961","id":725061732,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyNTA2MTczMg==","user":{"login":"tkhurana","id":679072,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3OTA3Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/679072?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkhurana","html_url":"https://github.com/tkhurana","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkhurana/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkhurana/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkhurana/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkhurana/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkhurana/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkhurana/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkhurana/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkhurana/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkhurana/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-11T01:03:50Z","updated_at":"2020-11-11T01:03:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Last questions what is the impact to changing the output of MutationState::getUpdateCount() in the paths where that is used?
