Also had to do a rebase due to conflicts.\r\n\r\nRegarding the thoughts you brought up:\r\n- Bubble up `UnloadableTypeSerializerException` approach:\r\nI introduced the exception, but only use it minimally. I think overall it is definitely an improvement, since we don't have to carry the dummy flag all the way down to the low-level serializer serialization proxy. However, I don't think there really is a need to handle it any level higher than the `TypeSerializerSerializationUtil.readSerializersAndConfigsWithResilience` method, since the original intent of that method was to always be fault tolerant when reading a bunch of serializers alongside other things. More details on that in my above comments.\r\n\r\n- Whether or not we really need to hand down the flag to `KeyedBackendSerializationProxy`:\r\nMy gut feeling is that, even if in the future we bubble up the `UnloadableTypeSerializerException` to higher level components, the serialization proxy is still where we need to decide whether or not we handle it with a dummy serializer. The reason is that the serialization proxies handles deserialization of _all_ keyed state meta infos (and therefore their serializers); simply bubbling the exception further up without checking does not make sense.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/386523870/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/386530451","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/5952#issuecomment-386530451","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/5952","id":386530451,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NjUzMDQ1MQ==","user":{"login":"tzulitai","id":5284370,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODQzNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5284370?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai","html_url":"https://github.com/tzulitai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-04T07:59:03Z","updated_at":"2018-05-04T07:59:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Would filtering the thread count by thread name be helpful here?\r\n\r\nAnother possible approach to test this:\r\nMaybe we can simply verify that the current transaction producer is closed after the cleanup?\r\nThis would require making the `getCurrentTransaction()` method visible for tests, though.

The steps are the following:\r\n\r\n  1. JobMaster / SlotPool requests a slot (AllocationID) from the ResourceManager\r\n  2. ResourceManager starts a container with a TaskManager\r\n  3. TaskManager registers at ResourceManager, which tells the TaskManager to push a slot to the JobManager.\r\n  4. TaskManager container is killed\r\n  5. The ResourceManager does not queue back the slot requests (AllocationIDs) that it sent to the previous TaskManager, so the requests are lost and need to time out before another attempt is tried.\r\n\r\nSome thoughts on how to deal with this:\r\n  - It seems the ResourceManager should put the slots from the TaskManager that was failed back to \"pending\" so they are given to the next TaskManager that starts.\r\n  - I assume that is not happening, because there is concern that the failure is also detected on the JobManager/SlotPool and retried there and there are double re-tries\r\n  - The solution would be to better define the protocol with respect to who is responsible for what retries.\r\n\r\nTwo ideas on how to fix that:\r\n  1. The ResourceManager notifies the SlotPool that a certain set of AllocationIDs has failed, and the SlotPool directly retries the allocations, resulting in directly starting new containers.\r\n  2. The ResourceManager always retries allocations for AllocationIDs it knows. The SlotPool would not retry, it would keep the same allocations always unless they are released as unneeded. We would probably need something to make sure that the SlotPool can distinguish from different offers of the same AllocationID (in case the ResourceManager assumes a timeout but a request goes actually through) - possibly something like an attempt-counter (higher wins).\r\n\r\n@tillrohrmann also interested in your thoughts here.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/386831680/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/386849315","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/5954#issuecomment-386849315","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/5954","id":386849315,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4Njg0OTMxNQ==","user":{"login":"yanghua","id":2283778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODM3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2283778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua","html_url":"https://github.com/yanghua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-06T02:41:26Z","updated_at":"2018-05-06T02:41:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"cc

not using a `CassandraPojoSinkBuilder` for the moment).\r\nAnd create a new `Configuration()` with this `keyspace` in `CassandraPojoSink`.\r\nAnd finally do a `cluster.connect(keyspace);`\r\n\r\nI've done this [here](https://github.com/apache/flink/compare/master...ctamisier:pojo-keyspace) if you can have a look.\r\nI've updated `CassandraConnectorITCase` with a new test.\r\nI would like to run `CassandraPojoSinkExample.main()` to cover the `CassandraSink.addSink()` mechanism, but it doesn't work for me (even on flink master branch).\r\n\r\nCan this be a candidate for a PR, I am new to flink

Hence, inactive buckets might not get closed in time it doesn't receive records. \r\n\r\nTo ensure that a file is closed after the rollover interval even if no records are written to it, we should extend (and rename) the `checkForInactiveBuckets()` method to also check for files to close due to the rollover interval. This shouldn't be expensive since we are iterating over the buckets anyway. Moreover, we should extend the documentation of `setBatchRolloverInterval()` and `setInactiveBucketCheckInterval()` to describe that the check interval is also used to check the rollover interval.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\nBest, Fabian","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/387077542/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/387081035","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/5923#issuecomment-387081035","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/5923","id":387081035,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NzA4MTAzNQ==","user":{"login":"NicoK","id":213026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzAyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/213026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicoK","html_url":"https://github.com/NicoK","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicoK/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicoK/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicoK/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicoK/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicoK/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicoK/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicoK/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicoK/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicoK/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-07T14:23:16Z","updated_at":"2018-05-07T14:23:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Honestly, I did not find the proposed change too convincing either due to the additional branch into bounded vs. unbounded partitions which caused the variable names to be wrong in the unbounded case.
