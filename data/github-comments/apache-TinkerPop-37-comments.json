 i've merged your PR and rebased the TINKERPOP-1878 branch on tp33. please make sure that you update your fork.  i'm beginning to think we should rebase to master so that sparql-gremlin releases with 3.4.0 but that's a different discussion. \r\n\r\nnote that i reformatted some of your docs a bit and that the docs were failing to generate in some cases due to errors in the sparql syntax. i've also noticed that a few of your examples return no results, which isn't ideal. if you could give a look to those (ones marked with `[source,groovy]` were returning errors and i guess you'd either have to generate docs or run the sparql manually to see which aren't returning results) and offer a follow-on PR to fix that up, that would be most helpful. \r\n\r\nThanks for this PR btw - nice to see the documentation rounding out.

Hopefully, sometime this week. Here's some quick comments based on the discussion:\r\n\r\n> I actually think we should make DFS the default for OLTP\r\n>  I'd want to give users a bit of time to know this exists, and make the switch after there's some awareness of the option to toggle between the two.\r\n\r\nThat's a topic that is probably worth a DISCUSS thread on the dev mailing list. I typically reference threads like that as a link in the associated JIRA.\r\n\r\n> mvn clean test\r\n\r\nThat should work, but typically only after `mvn clean install` of a new branch.  gremlin-shaded and hadoop-gremlin typically cause that problem, as a result, you really can only do `mvn clean install` at least until 3.4.x when i get some changes in (maybe...hopefully).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/381561500/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/381581728","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/833#issuecomment-381581728","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/833","id":381581728,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MTU4MTcyOA==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-16T12:27:22Z","updated_at":"2018-04-16T12:27:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I implemented all your suggestions @dkuppitz -

trying to decide how to treat this and #846 - we could merge these docs in, but the intent is to fix these prior to next release, so we'd just end up removing them again. maybe, that's fine, so long as we remember to do so. perhaps JIRA should be updated in both issues as a reminder to do that?\r\n\r\nMy intent is to manually update the currently deployed docs for 3.2.8 and 3.3.2 to include this information as these are both bad stumbling blocks for new users. I'm not sure how i want to do that either. I guess a one update to the docs would be fine because anyone using that version will be stuck with that problem until they upgrade, so I wouldnt' have to go back to update the docs again when these issues are resolved.

was hoping to see us merge this for next release, but now that we have to release this patch because of the groovy bug, there won't be a lot of time to do much with the cool changes you have here.  I was hoping we'd be able to see at least some GLV code translation in place for an actual release. Maybe that doesn't matter, in which case I guess we can merge this. Your call in that respect.\r\n\r\nA question though about the tab system...the tabs look good with two options as shown in your screenshot, but we have Console, Groovy, Java (maybe we wouldn't do that), Python, Javascript and .NET - how does it look when we have all those? Does the tab system scale that way?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/384241762/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/384257825","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/855#issuecomment-384257825","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/855","id":384257825,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NDI1NzgyNQ==","user":{"login":"jorgebay","id":2931196,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MzExOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2931196?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay","html_url":"https://github.com/jorgebay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-25T11:44:04Z","updated_at":"2018-04-25T11:44:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"VOTE +1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/384257825/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/384266883","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/844#issuecomment-384266883","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/844","id":384266883,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NDI2Njg4Mw==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-25T12:21:06Z","updated_at":"2018-04-25T12:21:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"VOTE +1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/384266883/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
