I ran into some issues talking to HBase with the new Profiler topology in the current Quick Dev environment.  Once I did the old-school injection of the site resources everything worked fine.\n\n```\ncd /etc/hbase/conf  && jar -uf /usr/metron/0.2.0BETA/lib/metron-profiler-0.2.0BETA.jar hbase-site.xml\ncd /etc/hadoop/conf && jar -uf /usr/metron/0.2.0BETA/lib/metron-profiler-0.2.0BETA.jar core-site.xml\ncd /etc/hadoop/conf && jar -uf /usr/metron/0.2.0BETA/lib/metron-profiler-0.2.0BETA.jar hdfs-site.xml\n```\n\nI am wondering if this is because of [METRON-356](https://github.com/nickwallen/incubator-metron/commit/b9282b438422d56fac23301dc854a39ae7d83a83).  Could the current version of Quick Dev be broken because we removed the site injection from Ansible, but have not updated the Vagrant box for Quick Dev out in Atlas?  \n\nIf so, it is not really a problem.

If you are running this on a multinode cluster, you would not have to do this.\r\n- Kill monit via `service monit stop`\r\n- Kill tcpreplay via `for i in $(ps -ef | grep tcpreplay | awk '{print $2}');do kill -9 $i;done`\r\n- Kill existing parser topologies via \r\n  - `storm kill snort`\r\n  - `storm kill bro`\r\n- Kill flume via `for i in $(ps -ef | grep flume | awk '{print $2}');do kill -9 $i;done`\r\n- Kill yaf via `for i in $(ps -ef | grep yaf | awk '{print $2}');do kill -9 $i;done`\r\n- Kill bro via `for i in $(ps -ef | grep bro | awk '{print $2}');do kill -9 $i;done`\r\n\r\n## Install Prerequisites and Mock DGA Service\r\n\r\nNow let's install some prerequisites:\r\n- Flask via `yum install python-flask`\r\n- Jinja2 via `yum install python-jinja2`\r\n- Squid client via `yum install squid`\r\n- ES Head plugin via `/usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/plugin install mobz/elasticsearch-head`\r\n\r\nStart Squid via `service squid start`\r\n\r\nNow that we have flask and jinja, we can create a mock DGA service to deploy with MaaS:\r\n- Download the files in [this](https://gist.github.com/cestella/cba10aff0f970078a4c2c8cade3a4d1a) gist into the `/root/mock_dga` directory\r\n- Make `rest.sh` executable via `chmod +x /root/mock_dga/rest.sh`\r\n\r\nThis service will treat `yahoo.com` and `amazon.com` as legit and everything else as malicious.  The contract is that the REST service exposes an endpoint `/apply` and returns back JSON maps with a single key `is_malicious` which can be `malicious` or `legit`.\r\n\r\n## Deploy Mock DGA Service via MaaS\r\n\r\nNow let's start MaaS and deploy the Mock DGA Service:\r\n- Start MaaS via `/usr/metron/0.2.0BETA/bin/maas_service.sh -zq node1:2181`\r\n- Start one instance of the mock DGA model with 512M of memory via `/usr/metron/0.2.0BETA/bin/maas_deploy.sh -zq node1:2181 -lmp /root/mock_dga -hmp /user/root/models -mo ADD -m 512 -n dga -v 1.0 -ni 1`\r\n- As a sanity check:\r\n  - Ensure that the model is running via `/usr/metron/0.2.0BETA/bin/maas_deploy.sh -zq node1:2181 -mo LIST`.  You should see `Model dga @ 1.0` be displayed and under that a url such as (but not exactly) `http://node1:36161`\r\n  - Try to hit the model via curl: `curl 'http://localhost:36161/apply?host=caseystella.com'` and ensure that it returns a JSON map indicating the domain is malicious.\r\n\r\n## Adjust Configurations for Squid to Call Model\r\n\r\nNow that we have a deployed model, let's adjust the configurations for the Squid topology to annotate the messages with the output of the model.\r\n- Edit the squid parser configuration at `/usr/metron/0.2.0BETA/config/zookeeper/parsers/squid.json` in your favorite text editor and add a new FieldTransformation to indicate a threat alert based on the model (note the addition of `is_malicious` and `is_alert`):\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"parserClassName\": \"org.apache.metron.parsers.GrokParser\",\r\n  \"sensorTopic\": \"squid\",\r\n  \"parserConfig\": {\r\n    \"grokPath\": \"/patterns/squid\",\r\n    \"patternLabel\": \"SQUID_DELIMITED\",\r\n    \"timestampField\": \"timestamp\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"fieldTransformations\" : [\r\n    {\r\n      \"transformation\" : \"STELLAR\"\r\n    ,\"output\" : [ \"full_hostname\", \"domain_without_subdomains\", \"is_malicious\", \"is_alert\" ]\r\n    ,\"config\" : {\r\n      \"full_hostname\" : \"URL_TO_HOST(url)\"\r\n      ,\"domain_without_subdomains\" : \"DOMAIN_REMOVE_SUBDOMAINS(full_hostname)\"\r\n      ,\"is_malicious\" : \"MAP_GET('is_malicious', MAAS_MODEL_APPLY(MAAS_GET_ENDPOINT('dga'), {'host' : domain_without_subdomains}))\"\r\n      ,\"is_alert\" : \"if is_malicious == 'malicious' then 'true' else null\"\r\n                }\r\n    }\r\n                           ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n- Edit the squid enrichment configuration at `/usr/metron/0.2.0BETA/config/zookeeper/enrichments/squid.json` (this file will not exist, so create a new one) to make the threat triage adjust the level of risk based on the model output:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"index\": \"squid\",\r\n  \"batchSize\": 1,\r\n  \"enrichment\" : {\r\n    \"fieldMap\": {}\r\n  },\r\n  \"threatIntel\" : {\r\n    \"fieldMap\":{},\r\n    \"triageConfig\" : {\r\n      \"riskLevelRules\" : {\r\n        \"is_malicious == 'malicious'\" : 100\r\n      },\r\n      \"aggregator\" : \"MAX\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n- Upload new configs via `/usr/metron/0.2.0BETA/bin/zk_load_configs.sh --mode PUSH -i /usr/metron/0.2.0BETA/config/zookeeper -z node1:2181`\r\n- Make the Squid topic in kafka via `/usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper node1:2181 --create --topic squid --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1`\r\n\r\n## Start Topologies and Send Data\r\n\r\nNow we need to start the topologies and send some data:\r\n- Start the squid topology via `/usr/metron/0.2.0BETA/bin/start_parser_topology.sh -k node1:6667 -z node1:2181 -s squid`\r\n- Generate some data via the squid client:\r\n  - Generate a legit example: `squidclient http://yahoo.com`\r\n  - Generate a malicious example: `squidclient http://cnn.com`\r\n- Send the data to kafka via `cat /var/log/squid/access.log | /usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list node1:6667 --topic squid`\r\n- Browse the data in elasticsearch via the ES Head plugin @ [http://node1:9200/_plugin/head/](http://node1:9200/_plugin/head/) and verify that in the squid index you have two documents\r\n  - One from `yahoo.com` which does not have `is_alert` set and does have `is_malicious` set to `legit`\r\n  - One from `cnn.com` which does have `is_alert` set to `true`, `is_malicious` set to `malicious` and `threat:triage:level` set to 100\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/239825715/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/239847546","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/210#issuecomment-239847546","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/210","id":239847546,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzOTg0NzU0Ng==","user":{"login":"cestella","id":540359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/540359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella","html_url":"https://github.com/cestella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-15T16:12:36Z","updated_at":"2016-08-15T16:12:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Please note that it is non-optimal to only be able to reference models from the beginning (i.e. parsers) and end (i.e. threat triage) of the pipeline.
