@jongyoul I have updated the PR to run the paragraph text once instead of breaking it into lines. But it leads one behavior change: the order of output is changed compared to previous implementation. Basically there're two kinds of outputs: repl output and code execution output. e.g.g\r\n\r\n```\r\nval a = \"hello world\"\r\nprintln(a)\r\n```\r\nOutput\r\n```\r\nhello world                         (This is code execution output)\r\na: String = hello world       (This is repl output)\r\n```\r\n\r\nCode execution output will be displayed while code is running, but repl output is only displayed after scala repl complete the code execution. That's why you will see that the repl output is always after the code execution output, that's why I update some test code in this PR.\r\n\r\nAlthough it changes the output order, I think it is correct approach. Breaking into multiple lines would make some code fail to be compiled by scala interpreter. e.g. `OldSparkInterpreter` can not pass this test. https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/3055/files#diff-b3caeb6afe474aec6d5352ac3ee3a02aR137","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/403401459/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/403403584","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/3058#issuecomment-403403584","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/3058","id":403403584,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMzQwMzU4NA==","user":{"login":"zjffdu","id":164491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu","html_url":"https://github.com/zjffdu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-09T08:37:34Z","updated_at":"2018-07-09T08:37:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Will zeppelin reindex all notes when zeppelin server is restarted ?

for the suggestion @zjffdu. \r\n\r\nThe same idea was given earlier by Leemoonsoo [here](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2502#issuecomment-323272122), and I had then [moved all of the required code](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2834/commits/28688256f3b11e696c08ed10875e0596db8c0463#diff-f9d22f7302ae356454cdcc637942856f) into the `interpolate(...)` method of the base class.\r\n\r\nSo, the PR for each interpreter now contains the following 4 elements:\r\n\r\n1) The configuration changes (defining the `zeppelin.???.interpolate` parameter) in the associated `interpreter-setting.json` file (seen [here](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/3068/files#diff-1081c34c222dd47418550b2660730df6)),\r\n2) The documentation changes in the associated `docs/interpreter/???.md` file (seen [here](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/3068/files#diff-dae0efb0a1eda2c293e809843480c781)), \r\n3) A 2-line change to the interpreter's `interpret()` method causing it to invoke `interpolate(...)` in the base class if `zeppelin.???.interpolate` is found to be true (seen [here](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/3068/files#diff-1c3f4657786b890b0c786adaec9b4004)), and\r\n4) The specific unit-test classes as applicable (seen [here](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/3068/files#diff-d117ea24a43ae0fd6db3151c50c658dc) and [here](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/3068/files#diff-4388c6558b95f9b2944130ed7b0ab5a5))\r\n\r\nKeeping this consistent set of files together in one PR helps the review process IMHO, but I am

is a great idea @zjffdu. \r\n\r\nThere are also a few other things to think of - like automatically generating the name of the enabler parameter on a per-interpreter basis (`zeppelin.shell.interpolation` in your sample code above). This can be done by adding a static map to `interpreter.java` that translates from interpreter class name to parameter name, but I think we will obtain greater mileage from the following 2-part strategy:\r\n\r\n1) refactor the `interpret(...)` method in all of the existing interpreters once to introduce the 2 lines that have to change in each interpreter (no need to introduce a new method like `interpret2(...)`\r\n2) add a map to `Interpreter.java` that translates from interpreter class name to parameter name, for use in the updated code in (1) above. This map could be filled  with unused names in advance without doing any harm.\r\n\r\nThis is more or less what I had in mind during [this earlier discussion](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2502#issuecomment-323272122), but I did not want to start it then as there was other interpreter refactoring work going on. Perhaps this is a better time to resume that thought :-) Allow me to ask the opinions of a wider group of reviewers - what do you think @felixcheung @jongyoul @zjffdu ?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/405444867/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/405461118","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/3076#issuecomment-405461118","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/3076","id":405461118,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNTQ2MTExOA==","user":{"login":"jongyoul","id":3612566,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTI1NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3612566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul","html_url":"https://github.com/jongyoul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-17T05:09:25Z","updated_at":"2018-07-17T05:09:25Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"https://travis-ci.org/jongyoul/zeppelin/jobs/404703539\r\n\r\nTest passed.
