`provided` scope (so in my understanding it does not get bundled as a part of release, so no need to specify the licences, but may be @Leemoonsoo can correct me on that)\n3. CI failure here seems to be not relevant (if could not be reproduced by subsequent runs, otherwise need to create JIRA issue for that)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/166489064/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/166501512","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/560#issuecomment-166501512","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/560","id":166501512,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NjUwMTUxMg==","user":{"login":"bzz","id":5582506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1ODI1MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5582506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz","html_url":"https://github.com/bzz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-22T04:15:02Z","updated_at":"2015-12-22T04:15:02Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Great stuff!
