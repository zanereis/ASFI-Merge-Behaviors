This is great! I was about to add the same function. We only have `RDD.top` in core, but if we have `PairRDDFunctions.topByKey`, we can make recommendation on a small batch of users/products. Another possible optimization is to use more partitions for the final user/product features. Beside some inline comments, could you also set the storage level of the final user/product features to `MEMORY_AND_DISK` in this PR? We saw use cases where the features were kicked out of memory by later jobs on the same cluster.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50766537/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50766704","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1688#issuecomment-50766704","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1688","id":50766704,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNzY2NzA0","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-31T14:33:54Z","updated_at":"2014-07-31T14:33:54Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA tests have started for PR 1688.

Do you know whether these fork()s benefit from a parallel speedup?    The old code probably has a higher latency to launch the very first set of tasks, since it has to serially fork() the intermediate layer of processes that this patch removes.\n\nKeep in mind that we're fork()ing a process with an extremely small heap, so it may not actually be that expensive.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50798724/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50798877","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1641#issuecomment-50798877","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1641","id":50798877,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNzk4ODc3","user":{"login":"marmbrus","id":527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus","html_url":"https://github.com/marmbrus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-31T18:27:04Z","updated_at":"2014-07-31T18:27:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the review!
