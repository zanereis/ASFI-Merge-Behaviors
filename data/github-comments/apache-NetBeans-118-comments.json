Making it the background colour makes the tab slightly shallower than the container, with the bar effectively appearing on top. I don't see the second set of images makes the unfocused tab look focused in the same way the first set did.  At the same time, I find current FlatLaf very difficult to see what the active tab is in an unfocused set.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1167725504/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1167731843","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/3992#issuecomment-1167731843","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/3992","id":1167731843,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5FmiyD","user":{"login":"eirikbakke","id":886243,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NjI0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/886243?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke","html_url":"https://github.com/eirikbakke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-27T18:34:49Z","updated_at":"2022-06-27T18:34:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've been using this patch in my working IDE and platform app since November now; I think it should be safe to apply.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1167731843/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1167748430","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/4286#issuecomment-1167748430","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4286","id":1167748430,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5Fmm1O","user":{"login":"eirikbakke","id":886243,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NjI0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/886243?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke","html_url":"https://github.com/eirikbakke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-27T18:48:16Z","updated_at":"2022-06-27T22:13:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"1) OK, one way or another, there will be some inconsistency here; some TopComponents will have toolbars and others will not.\r\n2) OK, I see the utility.

Yes, you can see this in your screenshot with the `Output` region. I don't think adding _another_ level of inconsistency with multiple tab colours is the right approach.

There isn't a border, there's padding.  If we wanted one, we could make it the same as the tab separator colour.  I'm not against borders - I have an issue with adding gradients to a flat look and feel.  If you look at the examples you shared from other software, a border alone (unless it's the accent colour) is not enough. Border or not, they work because of contrasting inactive tab background. @Chris2011 made that point too.\r\n4. I think it should be clear where the window regions are. So having the dividers the same colour as the toolbar and status bar makes sense unless we add yet another colour. FlatLaf already has this blurring problem.

This fetches the possible declaration locations and sorts these. In the profile it is visible, that around 80% of the time is spend inside `DeclarationFinderImpl$AlternativeLocationImpl.compareTo()`, which uses `DeclarationFinderImpl$AlternativeLocationImpl.getStringLocation()` as basis for comparison.  `getStringLocation` reads the JS file to calculate the line number from the raw offset and is not cached.\r\n\r\nI only tested with the build-in stubs, but already saw a runtime reduction of the call from around 4s for 10 calls to 1s for 10 calls. Please test if this improves the situation for you. Bigger projects and/or slow drives can significantly increase runtime.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1172605641/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1172836869","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/4263#issuecomment-1172836869","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4263","id":1172836869,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5F6BIF","user":{"login":"tbw777","id":15821889,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODIxODg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15821889?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbw777","html_url":"https://github.com/tbw777","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbw777/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbw777/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbw777/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbw777/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbw777/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbw777/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbw777/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbw777/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbw777/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-02T05:12:07Z","updated_at":"2022-07-02T05:15:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15821889/176987457-b13dafb2-fcfd-417f-a5e9-babca3864644.png)\r\n\r\nbut
