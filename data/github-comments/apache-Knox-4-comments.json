just to make sure I understand the problem, the issue is that the launcher runs the gateway process and doesn't wait for the initialization of the server to complete before returning and saying this is up and running.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to maybe use the listener or another method in the GatewayServer to wait until initialization is complete? Is the launcher returning too soon? \r\n\r\nIdeally after `GatewayServer` starts the server would be completely ready. It is weird that we are saying that everything is good before that :/\r\n\r\nI am not sure I am a fan of the writing a file and checking the output to avoid what looks to be a fundamental gateway starting issue. I wonder how we avoid this in tests currently. There must be an existing method to make sure that the topology is deployed or something along those lines or we would see issues like this in the tests.

Right after the Java call the script continues to check if the PID exists. Usually, it takes some time for the server to start up but the script indicates it's up&running because the PID is there.\r\n\r\nIt's not _easy_ to add hook in a shell script to check the 2nd case:\r\n1. either the server persists its state somewhere which the script can read (this is what I implemented here)\r\n2. or the script tries to ping the server somehow\r\n2.1.

latest changes include:\r\n- appropriate bordering on homepage\r\n- homepage is bound to `/` (i.e. is available on https://localhost:8443)\r\n- new metadata API endpoint to download public certificate in PEM/JKS format\r\n- changed Hive's service URL to a sample JDBC URL\r\n- re-ordered API/UI services on homepage\r\n- renamed `Topology Browsing` to `Topologies`\r\n- `General Proxy Information` font size is the same as `Topologies`\r\n- new `Metadata API` links are added into `General Proxy Information`\r\n\r\n@risdenk, the (i) buttons are tooltips; they show a meaningful description of the service\r\n\r\nI'm going to file a follow-up JIRA to enhance the homepage based on @lmccay 's recommendations","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/issues/comments/592078393/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/issues/comments/592445217","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/knox/pull/263#issuecomment-592445217","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/issues/263","id":592445217,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5MjQ0NTIxNw==","user":{"login":"smolnar82","id":34065904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDY1OTA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34065904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82","html_url":"https://github.com/smolnar82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-28T10:13:28Z","updated_at":"2020-02-28T10:13:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Follow-up
