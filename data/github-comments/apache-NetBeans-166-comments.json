I have lot of resources and upon checking task manager, seems like there are free resources (system is not full), neither I am not even trying to open a bigger project of large size. Can I get more guide on how to fix these broken links. Seems like the links are doing the problem , I have tried to run the application from the installed folder as well, Netbeans-17/netbeans/bin/netabeans64.exe. Any help would be appreciated, I can do my work on linux on side as well, but still doing the comment so maybe someone else could get more guide if they encounter the same bug.

If any modal dialog is active, and another modal dialog is being opened, then shouldn't it always have the existing modal as a parent?\r\n\r\nI am not really familiar with the need for the `NbPresenter.currentModalDialog` field. It looks like [`ProfilerDialogs`](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/blob/master/profiler/profiler/src/org/netbeans/modules/profiler/impl/ProfilerDialogs.java) is the only place that sets `leaf` to anything other than the default, although it was originally put in place to address [Bugzilla #53525](https://bz.apache.org/netbeans/show_bug.cgi?id=53525). I'm inclined to remove the `currentModalDialog` field and just keep the existing `instanceof` check on the active window.\r\n\r\nWe could also simplify the `Frame` vs. `Window` logic by adding constructor overloads that take `Window` since `JDialog` now has an equivalent overload (as of Java 6) which I assume was not available 20 years ago when the original `NbPresenter` constructors were created.\r\n\r\nI'll add some changes in additional commits (which I can squash before merging if desired).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1563178530/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1563213030","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/5989#issuecomment-1563213030","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5989","id":1563213030,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5dLLzm","user":{"login":"errael","id":20450427,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDUwNDI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20450427?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/errael","html_url":"https://github.com/errael","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/errael/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/errael/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/errael/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/errael/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/errael/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/errael/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/errael/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/errael/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/errael/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-25T16:46:51Z","updated_at":"2023-05-25T16:46:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> We could also simplify the `Frame` vs. `Window` logic\r\n\r\nAnother possible simplification:\r\nCould the two branches of\r\n```\r\nif (descriptor instanceof DialogDescriptor) {\r\n} else {\r\n}\r\n```\r\nbe collapsed into a single branch by prefacing the unified branch with something like\r\n```\r\ncreatePresenter = descriptor instanceof DialogDescriptor\r\n    ?

So, as said above, the zip will probably be OK on Windows. The Tomcat folder might be in the IDE directory somewhere though.\r\n\r\nOTOH, try eg. `cd /; netbeans;` with the Linux packages and it doesn't.

It is just a \"stable\" wrapper over \"Class.getMethods()\" since the returned order is not specified and is random for that method.\r\n\r\nThe order varies between JDK 17 and JDK 19:\r\n\r\n17:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic javax.swing.plaf.PanelUI javax.swing.JPanel.getUI()\r\npublic javax.swing.plaf.ComponentUI javax.swing.JPanel.getUI()\r\n```\r\n\r\n19:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic javax.swing.plaf.ComponentUI javax.swing.JPanel.getUI()\r\npublic javax.swing.plaf.PanelUI javax.swing.JPanel.getUI()\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor both cases in the constructor of `PropertyDescriptor` `getReadMethod` is invoked, which more or less directly delegates to `Introspector#findMethod` which delegates to `Introspector#internalFindMethod`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/a92363461dbe67d8736a6b0c3cbe1c3ad7aa28ae/src/java.desktop/share/classes/java/beans/Introspector.java#L1156-L1184\r\n\r\nThe first method, that has the right name and arguments is returned. And here is the difference between JDK 17 and 19 (see order above). For 17 you will get the getter, that returns `javax.swing.plaf.PanelUI` and for 19 you will get `javax.swing.plaf.ComponentUI`.\r\n\r\nNow execution returns to the `PropertyDescriptor` constructor and invokes `getWriteMethod`. It will first deduce the property type from the read method (the return type discussed in the previous paragraph) and now it tries to find the write method, that takes the property type as parameter.\r\n\r\nSo for 17 it looks for `setUI(javax.swing.plaf.PanelUI)` and for 19 it will look for `setUI(javax.swing.plaf.ComponentUI)`. Only the former can be satisfied:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic void javax.swing.JPanel.setUI(javax.swing.plaf.PanelUI)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI still think, that the introspector is wrong.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1564856713/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1564861122","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/5990#issuecomment-1564861122","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5990","id":1564861122,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5dReLC","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-26T19:55:35Z","updated_at":"2023-05-26T19:55:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"PR is open.
