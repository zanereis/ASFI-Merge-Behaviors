\r\n\r\nCould use your thoughts with a conundrum using Cleaner.  Cleaner is directly tied to an object while finalize() is indirect in that the JVM keeps track of those objects that have a finalize method. \r\n\r\nUnsafe is stateful with native address (in various forms) and an optional object reference.  \r\n\r\n1) Create a parent class that refers to a native region in memory using Unsafe with these state values and register it with the JVM Cleaner.\r\n\r\n2) Create a child \"region\" class that needs to refer to that same region of memory as a \"view\".\r\nIt has to copy or refer to those same state variables (perhaps modified by an offset) in order to use Unsafe.  \r\n\r\n3) The parent's cleaner.clean() is called and the parent's references to native memory are all cleaned up and the memory is freed from the OS.\r\n\r\nHow do we clean the child?  If the users still holds a reference to the child and tries to do any operation with Unsafe against the state variables it knows about, it will result in a seg-fault. Even if the nativeBaseAddress is set to zero!  \r\n\r\nOption A) If the parent has a Cleaner, then the children have to register their own cleaner as well. But it could create a race condition if the Parent cleaner is called preemptively by the user.  \r\n\r\nOption B) Similar to A, but we don't allow the user to ever call Cleaner preemptively.  Once the GC starts all the user threads are disabled so we couldn't have the race condition.\r\n\r\nIf B is the way to go I have concern that we may have only a few parent objects, but have many thousands of child views of that parent.

It's S3.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/280528060/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/280534185","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/3943#issuecomment-280534185","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3943","id":280534185,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MDUzNDE4NQ==","user":{"login":"drcrallen","id":8213081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMTMwODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8213081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen","html_url":"https://github.com/drcrallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-17T02:47:37Z","updated_at":"2017-02-17T02:47:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"At one point this had problems with HLL buffers,  I don't remember what the issue was off hand.

What i am trying to achieve is the following. Ideally any segment that i used hdfs pusher to push it i can use hdfs puller to read it. For instance here i can use hdfs pusher with a file system such as S3a then since the loadspec is hdfs, the only way to read it back is via hdfs puller. So in general what i want to get to is if i use pusher X to push data i can read it what puller X. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n*Comments from [Reviewable](https://reviewable.io:443/reviews/druid-io/druid/3940)*\r\n<!-- Sent from Reviewable.io -->\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/280541895/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/280543932","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/3019#issuecomment-280543932","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3019","id":280543932,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MDU0MzkzMg==","user":{"login":"b-slim","id":7376396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNzYzOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7376396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim","html_url":"https://github.com/b-slim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-17T03:56:17Z","updated_at":"2017-02-17T03:56:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@sirpkt can you help with this issue https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!msg/druid-user/wiXVMMmXOgU/fHXn6hR0CQAJ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/280543932/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/280551308","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/3892#issuecomment-280551308","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3892","id":280551308,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MDU1MTMwOA==","user":{"login":"niketh","id":626548,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNjU0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/626548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketh","html_url":"https://github.com/niketh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-17T04:47:50Z","updated_at":"2017-02-17T04:47:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@leerho @leventov IMO I think the cleaned flag isn't a great idea, its better not to have explicit close.

Ideally any segment that i used hdfs pusher to push it i can use hdfs puller to read it. For instance here i can use hdfs pusher with a file system such as S3a then since the loadspec is hdfs, the only way to read it back is via hdfs puller. So in general what i want to get to is if i use pusher X to push data i can read it what puller X.\r\n\r\nYour argument is reasonable, but I think the reason we are disagreeing is that in a Hadoop-based indexing job you're not actually using the hdfs pusher. It doesn't use the pushers at all, it has its own hard coded pushing code that is based purely on the scheme.\r\n\r\nPut another way, a user could configure S3 deep storage in two ways:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndruid.storage.type=hdfs\r\ndruid.storage.storageDirectory=s3n://foo/bar\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\ndruid.storage.type=s3\r\ndruid.storage.bucket=foo\r\ndruid.storage.baseKey=bar\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn non-Hadoop based indexing jobs, where the pushers actually do get used, the former gets loadSpec \"hdfs\" and the latter gets \"s3_zip\" even though the segments end up in the same place. In Hadoop-based indexing jobs the loadSpec for both will be \"s3_zip\" since it only looks at the scheme.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that it would be best for the user to have similar control over the loadSpec in Hadoop-based jobs, rather than forcing one choice or another. Does that sound right to you and would you be open to working on that?\r\n\r\nFor my part, as long as the user has no choice in loadSpec used for S3 storages in Hadoop-based jobs, I think they should stay what they currently are, which is \"s3_zip\", for all S3 schemes (s3, s3n, s3a).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/280701187/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/280712964","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/3946#issuecomment-280712964","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3946","id":280712964,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MDcxMjk2NA==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-17T17:25:22Z","updated_at":"2017-02-17T17:25:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@huangchaosuper, what code is triggering this error and how much of your cluster is running 0.9.2?

Looking into the druid code i found out that the input will be read as a string which cause the exception.
