You can see difference between [MapFile](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/api/org/apache/hadoop/io/MapFile.html) and [SequenceFile](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/api/org/apache/hadoop/io/SequenceFile.html).\r\n\r\n> Won't it cause some discrepancy?\r\n\r\nIt may well do.

Use getConfiguration() to set configuration items as opposed to overriding the entire configuration object as it's used internally. Also make sure to update the Class and Method-level API documentation to ```{@link CrawlDbReducer#reduce(Text, Iterator, Context)}``` this is present in several Classes and you have not updated it yet.\r\n\r\nregarding ```CrawlDbUpdateUtil.java:58: error: cannot find symbol``` this is due to removal of ```configure``` method for Reducer.java. Please see [Javadoc](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/api/org/apache/hadoop/mapreduce/Reducer.html). You may have to work with ```setup``` instead.\r\n\r\nFix both of the above, which once addressed will bring the compilation back to stable I think. Also check out the Javadoc for [TaskInputOutputContext](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/api/index.html?org/apache/hadoop/mapreduce/TaskInputOutputContext.html) and ensure that CrawlDbUpdateUtil.DummyContext overrides the appropriate methods with the appropriate parameters.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/comments/312743093/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/comments/312847353","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nutch/pull/190#issuecomment-312847353","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/190","id":312847353,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMjg0NzM1Mw==","user":{"login":"sebastian-nagel","id":1630582,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzA1ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1630582?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastian-nagel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-04T10:48:18Z","updated_at":"2017-07-04T10:48:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"(it's late I know)\r\n- this commit makes the nightly tests fail ([#3431](https://builds.apache.org/view/M-R/view/Nutch/job/Nutch-trunk/3431/))\r\n- I would recommend to always open a Jira issue - for release reports and also because build failures are tracked there but not here on github\r\n- please, also run `ant clean runtime test` to test patches/PRs\r\n\r\n@vipulbehl: thanks, that's an improvement, having the complete text in a single line.
