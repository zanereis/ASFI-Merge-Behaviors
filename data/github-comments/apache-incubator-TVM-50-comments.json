could you please clarify the place of scheduling operations in Relay? Do we plan to allow users to specify schedulers manually or we mean automatic scheduling during some phases of Relay->TVM transformation?\r\n\r\nI'm asking this because I am working on performance measurements for a large model, exported from TensorFlow to NNVM. I am facing the case where automatic schedulers were able to accelerate some parts of the model (~2x faster than TF on CPU), but for other parts they showed poor results. In order to figure out the cause I had to \"reverse engineer\" the NNVM graph back to sources. ([Here](https://github.com/grwlf/tvm/tree/staging/nnvm/python/nnvm/staging) is a draft code for `GraphDef` staging). I am not finished yet but it seems I will need to schedule some parts manually and AFAIK it is not that simple in NNVM. What about Relay? What would be the workflow for cases where manual scheduling is required?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/427348599/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/427362288","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/1799#issuecomment-427362288","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1799","id":427362288,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNzM2MjI4OA==","user":{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-05T13:15:46Z","updated_at":"2018-10-05T18:20:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"`expand_dims`
