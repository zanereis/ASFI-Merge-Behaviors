What do you mean by incremental loads? \r\n```\r\nOriginal data size = 414 GB and Hudi data size = 424 GB\r\nAfter 4 incremental loads, original came around 2100 GB with Snapshot data in each partition and Hudi data size was 547 GB\r\nI tested for another scenario with >1.5 TB with the same process as above\r\n```\r\nIn this, does incremental load mean, you took your original dataset and made some updates to some of the records and did an upsert to hudi? Or without doing any updates, you ingested into hudi? \r\nAlso, is 2100Gb = (414 Gb * 5) i.e one version of original and 4 incremental copies? \r\n\r\n2. also, by Hudi data size, you mean on disk size? (which includes all versions of data) or just the snapshot data size? \r\n\r\n3. \r\n```\r\nOriginal = 1.6 TB, Hudi 1.3 TB\r\nAfter 1 incremental, orig = 2.9 TB and Hudi 2.5 TB\r\n```\r\nThis confuses me as to whats incremental. In previous example, I thought you took entire original data and made another copy w/ some updates. but here i see only 1.3Tb added to 1.6Tb. Or in general, incremental means, updates to some records from original snapshot. \r\n\r\nOnce I get a clarification on these, will respond to your questions. \r\n@codope : will look into the delete issue w/ bulk_insert. \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/903878681/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/903879741","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/2498#issuecomment-903879741","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/2498","id":903879741,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM414Bw9","user":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-23T15:33:27Z","updated_at":"2021-08-23T15:33:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@codope is looking into this. we will get back to you in a day or two.

let me try to go over how COW works and it might help you understand the increase in data size. \r\n\r\nLet's say on first ingest, these are the data files created within hudi. for simplicity, lets assume just 1 partition. \r\n\r\ndf1_v1: 1Gb\r\ndf2_v1: 1Gb\r\ndf3_v1: 1Gb\r\n\r\n3 data files are created with version 1 and each is 1Gb size. \r\n\r\nNow, lets say we we do an incremental load, (inserts + updates). Update records belong just to df1 and df3. \r\nwith COW, hudi created newer version for each data file touched. So, final state would be \r\n// old data file versions.\r\ndf1_v1\r\ndf2_v1\r\ndf3_v1\r\n// newer version of existing data files\r\ndf1_v2 (1.2Gb)\r\ndf3_v2 (1.4Gb)\r\n// new data files for new inserts\r\ndf4_v1 (0.5Gb)\r\n\r\nNow total size = (df1_v1 + df2_v1, df3_v1, df1_v2, df3_v2, df4_v1) = 6.1Gb. \r\nSo, total disk size occupied by hudi is kind of dependent on how updates are applied. For instance, if there are updates to all data files (df1, df2, df3), every new commit will result in 2X the size. But if you have 1000s of data files, only some may get updated, the equation might differ. And depending on whether you have small file handling enabled or not, inserts could get bin packed into existing data files or routed to new data files. \r\nAlso, you have set max commits retained = 5. And hence only after 5 commits, older file versions might start to get deleted. \r\n\r\nWrt difference between insert_overwrite and bulk_insert w/ save mode as Overwrite is, hudi does cleaning async of the invalid files w/ insert_overwrite. in other words, files are not deleted synchronously. \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/904295065/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/904302097","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/3528#issuecomment-904302097","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3528","id":904302097,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM415o4R","user":{"login":"hudi-bot","id":79415918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDE1OTE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79415918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/hudi-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-24T03:56:55Z","updated_at":"2021-08-24T04:53:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\nMeta data\n{\n  \"version\" : 1,\n  \"metaDataEntries\" : [ {\n    \"hash\" : \"64e94a26a9fb98e8f6e5e713fe01d7a38d044eef\",\n    \"status\" : \"SUCCESS\",\n    \"url\" : \"https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=1870\",\n    \"triggerID\" : \"64e94a26a9fb98e8f6e5e713fe01d7a38d044eef\",\n    \"triggerType\" : \"PUSH\"\n  } ]\n}-->\n## CI report:\n\n* 64e94a26a9fb98e8f6e5e713fe01d7a38d044eef Azure: [SUCCESS](https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=1870) \n\n<details>\n<summary>Bot commands</summary>\n  @hudi-bot supports the following commands:\n\n - `@hudi-bot run travis` re-run the last Travis build\n - `@hudi-bot run azure` re-run the last Azure build\n</details>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/904302097/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/904323753","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/2498#issuecomment-904323753","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/2498","id":904323753,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM415uKp","user":{"login":"codope","id":16440354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQwMzU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16440354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope","html_url":"https://github.com/codope","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-24T05:01:35Z","updated_at":"2021-08-24T05:24:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I can reproduce the same behavior with Hudi 0.7.0 but not with 0.8.0 on Apache Spark 3.0.1.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: Built the 0.7.0 code for Spark3: `mvn clean package -DskipTests -Dscala-2.12 -Dspark3`.
