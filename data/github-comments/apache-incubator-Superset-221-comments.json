Create two listener in ALB, one running on port 80 and another running on 443 with certificate attached to it.\r\nStep 2. Write a redirect rule in listener with port 80 for permanent redirect to port 443, your rule should look like below\r\n\r\n`https://#{host}:443/#{path}?#{query`\r\n\r\nSo any redirect happens on the application level will redirect to https.

adding `sm.get_session.close()` to the bottom of `superset/__init__.py` fixes it.\r\n> \r\n> I have also experienced this bug. I think it happens because:\r\n> \r\n> * `superset/__init__.py` calls\r\n> * `ConnectorRegistry.register_sources(module_datasource_map)` and that in turn does\r\n> * `__import__(module_name, fromlist=class_names)` and that ends up calling\r\n> * `flask_appbuilder.base.add_view()` which eventually calls\r\n> * `sm.add_permissions_menu()` which calls\r\n> * `find_permission_view_menu()` which does\r\n> * `return self.get_session.query(self.permissionview_model).filter_by(permission=permission, view_menu=view_menu).first()`\r\n> \r\n> The final call is executing a query against the database, and because of the Python dbapi transaction semantics we now have an open, idle transaction which blocks the `CREATE TABLE`. That happens because the table has a foreign key to `ab_user` and so creating the constraint on the database requires `AccessExclusiveLock` on `ab_user`, and the transaction can't get that if there is another open transaction somewhere that has selected it somehow.\r\n> \r\n> It's not clear what the best place to fix it is.\r\n> \r\n> * you could file a bug against Flask-Appbuilder and propose that `add_view` should always leave the database without an open transaction - i.e. you call `self.sm.get_session.close()` at the bottom of `add_view` before `return baseview`\r\n> * you could try and fix it in `appbuilder.security.manager` by closing the session before returning the found permission/view - but that will be invasive and you would need to apply it to all the `find_` methods and it might break other things if we are calling `find` midway through a transaction to create a new menu or whatever\r\n> * you could fix it in `superset/__init__.py` by calling `sm.get_session.close` at the bottom of the file - that seems safe as we can be sure we shouldn't have any transactions in flight at that point\r\n> * you might also be able to make it work by getting the migration command to use the same session as the security manager\r\n\r\nGreat investigation. These are essentially my findings also. Ideally, reusing the connection would be nice but difficult to implement. I implemented an alternative #7417  to using sm.get_session.close() bu leveraging an app context that closes when going out of scope.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/488129590/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/488137736","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/5524#issuecomment-488137736","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/5524","id":488137736,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4ODEzNzczNg==","user":{"login":"betodealmeida","id":1534870,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzQ4NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1534870?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida","html_url":"https://github.com/betodealmeida","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-30T22:25:12Z","updated_at":"2019-04-30T22:25:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@1AB9502 still need some fixes, but here it is: https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7418","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/488137736/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/488144830","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/7353#issuecomment-488144830","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/7353","id":488144830,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4ODE0NDgzMA==","user":{"login":"rjurney","id":42149,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42149?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjurney","html_url":"https://github.com/rjurney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjurney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjurney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjurney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjurney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjurney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjurney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjurney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjurney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjurney/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-30T22:57:26Z","updated_at":"2019-04-30T22:57:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I played with this for over an hour.

couple of high-level points and suggestions for consideration:\r\n\r\n1. I'm not a big database guy, but **the term 'validation query'** seems to have an [established meaning](https://www.google.com/search?q=database+validation+query) and I fear this will be unnecessarily overloading a term and possibly causing confusion.  Someone implementing a new `BaseEngineSpec` impl might ask \"does my database support validation queries?\" and find [this comment on SO](https://stackoverflow.com/a/10684260/3407502) and do the wrong thing.  Consider:\r\n\r\n    - renaming it to something less ambiguous and more self-documenting\r\n    - adding more comments to the base class documenting the member property and method\r\n\r\n2. Tying this to a database's built in implementation is perhaps limiting. It seem unlikely that many (any?) new databases will supply this functionality, but if there was a configurable \"per-dialect\" or \"per database-type\" endpoint exposing an abstract API that we define, than lots of options could be plugged in there (including forwarding through to the provider). Consider:\r\n\r\n    - removing the validation support from `BaseEngineSpec` and having a configurable sql validation handler map, which by default has one impl for Presto that forwards to the server.  That way we reserve the right to implement additional handlers to make this feature available to other db types going forward. We might say _But we can always add that later!_, and that is true, but if we stub out the interfaces and make the pattern clear and self-documenting now, then the community might pick up the work to add verification handler types for other database types. The pattern we pick now is the pattern we are going to live with.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/488318130/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/488329354","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/7422#issuecomment-488329354","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/7422","id":488329354,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4ODMyOTM1NA==","user":{"login":"bearcage","id":596042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NjA0Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/596042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bearcage","html_url":"https://github.com/bearcage","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bearcage/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bearcage/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bearcage/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bearcage/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bearcage/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bearcage/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bearcage/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bearcage/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bearcage/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-01T16:15:46Z","updated_at":"2019-05-01T16:15:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Initially I had this in a separate endpoint, but it seemed like a lot of duplication of effort to pull over all the other conditional modifications we do on queries before executing them (limit, ctas, and templating).

How about `/validate_sql_json` for the endpoint and \"SQL Validation\" as the name of the feature?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHappy to add tests and typing — I have some tests which I'd planned to stack on this commit. I'll squash them instead. Since this portion of the code isn't particularly liberal with types, do y'all prefer py3-only annotations, or comment annotations?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/488329354/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/488330245","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/7422#issuecomment-488330245","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/7422","id":488330245,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4ODMzMDI0NQ==","user":{"login":"john-bodley","id":4567245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjcyNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4567245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley","html_url":"https://github.com/john-bodley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-01T16:19:05Z","updated_at":"2019-05-01T16:19:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Please use Python 3 only type annotations as Superset only supports Python 3.6+.

I _think_ it would literally just become:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    @classmethod\r\n    def make_validation_query(cls, sql):\r\n        '''\r\n        throws: Exception if no validator type is configured for engine\r\n        '''\r\n        return SQLValidator.get(cls.engine).validate(sql)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd that type would just do the last bit of prep that the method currently does, for that impl. The main thing here is this would move it to a configuration option and provide abstractions for impls, rather than make it an intrinsic property of database types.\r\n\r\nWhy am I pushing on this? LOL... I would love to see this be a feature that works well for all databases eventually, not just a patchwork or one-off if the customer has the right thing.  A consistent, delightful experience that isn't tied to the db in use, or at least leaving that possibility open.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/488331948/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/488336210","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/7374#issuecomment-488336210","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/7374","id":488336210,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4ODMzNjIxMA==","user":{"login":"john-bodley","id":4567245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjcyNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4567245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley","html_url":"https://github.com/john-bodley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-01T16:39:35Z","updated_at":"2019-05-01T16:39:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@mistercrunch
