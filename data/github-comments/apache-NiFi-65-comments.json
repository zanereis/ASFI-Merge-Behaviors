The last commit includes following changes.\r\n\r\nThe failing TestFTP.basicFileList has been added after I worked on this PR. It uses FakeFTPServer, which provides timestamp precision in minutes. Then this PR adds time precision auto detection by default. The file which was expected to be picked was not picked because it hadn't passed the required amount of lag time for minute precision. The test has been updated to use millisecond precision explicitly and also thread sleep has been added. The same error was confirmed in my environment, but it's been addressed.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, I found that TestAbstractListProcessor tests can fail due to luck of time unit setting, when generated timestamp does not have the desired time unit value, e.g. generated '10:51:00' where second precision is tested. This has been addressed, too.\r\n\r\nFinally, the reason for changing junit dependency is ListProcessorTestWatcher. It resides in `nifi-processor-utils` and is used by the project and also `nifi-standard-processors` project. In order to share ListProcessorTestWatcher via nifi-processor-utils, I changed junit scope to 'compile' because it needs to be accessible from the 'main' source, not by 'test' source. But 'provided' is more reasonable in this case, so I've updated it to 'provided'. Without having a mechanism like ListProcessorTestWatcher, debugging test failures will be very difficult, especially if it happens occasionally in a remote environment such as Travis CI.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/325337804/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/325355189","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2101#issuecomment-325355189","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2101","id":325355189,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNTM1NTE4OQ==","user":{"login":"mans2singh","id":8467404,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0Njc0MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8467404?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh","html_url":"https://github.com/mans2singh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-28T13:36:37Z","updated_at":"2017-08-28T13:36:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hey Nifi Team:  Please let me know your feedback/comments on this processor.
