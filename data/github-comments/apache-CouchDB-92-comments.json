We thought it could be daily chro jobs causing this and some adverse effect in the connections limits.\r\n\r\nThe reason why its so big of an issue for us is because we run some pretty massive clusters, 4 x 32 core instances with 64GB ram each, when the ram dumps it dumps hard, ie 50gb, during this time the node becomes unavailable, I suspect due to the fact it needs to then reload into ram the data to effectively serve requests. This takes time, it ends up taking longer to serve these requests and holds on to the connections, this then has a cascading effect that it exhausts the connection limit maximum threshold resulting in 502 Bad gateway errors as other requests are still coming in.\r\n\r\nNow for most of the users of couchDB this isn't a problem as they are not running a massive cluster, but sadly for us we have half the country running off it, where a small glitch like this is noticeable to say the least. We have had to manually reboot the system in the past and has resulted in someone being on-call 24/7 ... me...\r\n\r\nWhile scheduled reboots would fix it a patch would be greatly appreciated, esp since it's just a few lines of code. We are investigating migrating to couch 3.x but that's still in the planning stages and not sure it will happen this side of the year, and will probably result in 2 clusters, 1 remaining on 2.3 due to other limits related to connection, ect. since we have over 6,000 databases atm and twice as many replications.\r\n\r\nIf this can be done with a paid hot fix please contact me also.\r\n\r\nThanks for all your help.\r\nCheers\r\nDrav\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/671647975/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/671658824","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/2441#issuecomment-671658824","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/2441","id":671658824,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3MTY1ODgyNA==","user":{"login":"wohali","id":112292,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjI5Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112292?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali","html_url":"https://github.com/wohali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-11T00:40:24Z","updated_at":"2020-08-11T00:40:24Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"That's
