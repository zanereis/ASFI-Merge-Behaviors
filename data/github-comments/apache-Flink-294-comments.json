On master this error seems logic because the bug  `FlinkKafkaProducer011` can not be migrated to `FlinkKafkaProducer`isn't fixed yet. However I did try with @yanghua PR and the exception persists. I guess ever we can't initialize the state of a different operator with testHarness or the bug isn't fixed even after the PR.

As I don't want to mix two changes with different purpose in the same PR, we can make other code FailureRateRestartStrategy use it in another small PR.\r\n3) For the failure rate test for RM, I tried to do in ResourceManagerTest. I found it is hard to mimic the behavior of registerSlotRequest without mocking lots components. And I also have to setup Test RM exactly like what YarnResourceManagerTest is doing.
