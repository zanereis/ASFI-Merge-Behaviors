After thorough tests and benchmarks, I propose to simply remove the \"highest version\" optimization.\r\nThis is only an optimization. So I tested by deactivating it and it works (tests pass) and it does not reduce perf (SolrIndexing benchmark). Actually it seems it even improve perf in some bench cases, maybe due to the removal of unneeded methods to get the max version from the index.\r\n\r\nThis new commit removes the long \"highest\" from VersionBucket, and also removes all the methods in VersionInfo and UpdateLog to compute the max version. By reading the code and by running the tests, I'm convinced they were used only by tests and for an unnecessary optimization.

I will do a commit soon. \r\n\r\nI do not think we should keep the both behaviours because this an improvement and not a new feature. The users should not be affected because the model-store API endpoint will return the same formatted JSON as before.

Zookeeper on heap/off-heap memory? Zookeeper disk? Apache Solr on heap/off-heap memory? Apache Solr query time performance?\r\n> \r\n> Depending on the answers to these questions I would could be in favour of forcing the compact storage (if it's beneficial for performance significantly). In terms of the configurability discussion I believe it could be an over-complication, if it's for human readability I suspect it would be quite a quick process for a human to get the JSON and put it on some online editor such as jsonlint.com? Let's also remember that the limit in Zookeeper is currently configurable, but I agree it often causes headaches. And it comes without saying, thank you very much for the contribution @holysleeper and thanks @cpoerschke for the heads up!\r\n\r\nHello @alessandrobenedetti. The current implementation is affecting the off-heap Zookeeper memory size. Currently if we have 2 models each of 20MB and we want to add another one, zookeeper will use a lot of off-heap memory and it could go OOM (our container orchestrator will kill the container).  Even if we have the file size limit jute.maxbuffer set to 536870912 and ZK heap to 4GB. \r\n\r\nThe improvement in current PR will allow us to upload more models using less memory for ZK. \r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1784170646/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1784171333","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2030#issuecomment-1784171333","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2030","id":1784171333,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5qWEtF","user":{"login":"babesflorin","id":1515563,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTU1NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1515563?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/babesflorin","html_url":"https://github.com/babesflorin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/babesflorin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/babesflorin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/babesflorin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/babesflorin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/babesflorin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/babesflorin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/babesflorin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/babesflorin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/babesflorin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-29T17:14:07Z","updated_at":"2023-10-29T17:14:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> One thing I meant to ask, why not use the PackageStore instead?

That should probably be removed entirely if we're going to enable build caching in this new ge.gradle file.\r\n\r\nThis change actually will not. You still need the `org.gradle.caching=true` property for the configuration here to take effect. When that is true, then the configuration in this PR will be applied.\r\n\r\n> Even if the Crave integration is lacking; I don't think that should hold this up.\r\n\r\nI've done a little investigation on this so far, but without success. It would involve pulling files out of Gradle User Home back to the GitHub Actions runner. The `crave pull` command doesn't seem to let me access $HOME, which makes sense. I still have some avenues to explore, but I would not let that hold up this PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1789740972/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1789769580","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2040#issuecomment-1789769580","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2040","id":1789769580,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5qrbds","user":{"login":"uschindler","id":1005388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDUzODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1005388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uschindler","html_url":"https://github.com/uschindler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uschindler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uschindler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uschindler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uschindler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uschindler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uschindler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uschindler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uschindler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uschindler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-01T22:21:01Z","updated_at":"2023-11-01T22:21:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the change, looks fine.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1789769580/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1790659304","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2030#issuecomment-1790659304","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2030","id":1790659304,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5qu0ro","user":{"login":"cpoerschke","id":6458642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NTg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6458642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpoerschke","html_url":"https://github.com/cpoerschke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpoerschke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpoerschke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpoerschke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpoerschke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpoerschke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpoerschke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpoerschke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpoerschke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpoerschke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-02T12:44:20Z","updated_at":"2023-11-02T12:44:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> ... only the file is stored as compacted ... model-store endpoint will return a formatted JSON. ...\r\n\r\nYou're right.
