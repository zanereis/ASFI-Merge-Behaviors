I tried reproducing the stuck situation you encountered with a non-secure standalone NiFi, but to no avail. Public Input Ports in a child Process Group work fine. Tested:\r\n- Restart NiFi while GenerateFlowFile -> RPG keep sending data\r\n- Stop the port and start it again\r\n- Back-pressure, and recover from it \r\n- Delete and recreate the same port name\r\n\r\nIf that is reproducible with your NiFi, would you be able to capture stack-trace for further analysis?

I also rebased this against current master and everything looked good with the exception of an unrelated checkstyle error introduced elsewhere (I fixed that and some other minor issues in [0939f95](https://github.com/apache/nifi/commit/0939f951a3de776f74fa9f50d0a75a11a6f46b9d)). Feel free to pull that commit and make the above changes, and I'll merge.

I just thought it might be a good idea to clarify my initial report with a pull request. Especially since I had to get to know the code anyway to even open the ticket and describe the issue as best as I could.

In cases like that, there were issues with reusing the Evaluator. Now, that was a long time ago, and a lot of improvements & refactorings have been done. It's entirely possible that this may not be the case any longer, but I'd have to spend a lot more time testing & re-familiarizing myself with the code before I can be too definitive on it. In the meantime, would recommend you try running evaluations that contain the `anyMatchingAttribute`, `anyAttribute`, `allMatchingAttributes`, `allAttributes`, etc. types of functions.
