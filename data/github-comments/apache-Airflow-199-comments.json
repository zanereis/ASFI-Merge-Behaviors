Why is your solution better? Could you complete the documentation?\r\n\r\nThe solution prepared by me is a little better, because I am based on checking the correctness of the connection to the metastore during the task and it is not necessary to repeat it in case of hitting the offline connection. Secondly, I do not choose connections randomly, but only check them in succession, as they were entered, thanks to which I have 100% certainty of the task in case of at least one working connection.\r\nI have carried out the following test: I set the possibility of one additional attempt to perform a task that checks the existence of a partition in the hive. Next, I set 2 connections to the metastore (one online, the other offline). For 15 trials, only 75% of the tasks were passed correctly. On the other hand, more than 50% performed only during the second attempt. In my solution, each time it will be done during the first attempt (unless all connections are offline) - which may be a plus when calling such a connection in the middle of calculations, for example in PythonOperator (does not re-execute previous queries).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/463994831/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/464027216","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4714#issuecomment-464027216","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4714","id":464027216,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NDAyNzIxNg==","user":{"login":"GuzikJakub","id":27889052,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3ODg5MDUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27889052?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzikJakub","html_url":"https://github.com/GuzikJakub","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzikJakub/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzikJakub/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzikJakub/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzikJakub/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzikJakub/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzikJakub/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzikJakub/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzikJakub/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GuzikJakub/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-15T12:14:34Z","updated_at":"2019-02-15T12:14:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"My error.

Most operators, hooks, etc do not require a database. All operators for GCP also count in this. We can divide the tests into two categories: core and external integration (Not to be confused with integration tests). Dividing will be easy because we look at the structure of directories.  Some operators that can not do without a database will be markers as core tests, but it will be information that they are written incorrectly. In the future, we will be able to improve them.. \r\n\r\nI propose from the creation of the AIrflowTestCase/CoreAirflowTestCase class. CoreAIrflowTestCase will run external integration tests only when the AIRFLOW_TEST_SUBSET environment variable equals to \"core\". \r\n\r\nAnother idea is to use the decorator, but I think that such a class would be needed anyway. Another idea is to use a decorator, but I think that such a class would be useful anyway. I do not like the idea that every test would have to have a decorator, or run too many times. The idea that all tests have a parent in common sounds logical to me.\r\n\r\n ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/464107920/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/464137126","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4396#issuecomment-464137126","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4396","id":464137126,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NDEzNzEyNg==","user":{"login":"feng-tao","id":3223098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjMwOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3223098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao","html_url":"https://github.com/feng-tao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-15T17:43:39Z","updated_at":"2019-02-15T17:44:23Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@ffinfo , i would prefer the option 3 for the missing color issue.
