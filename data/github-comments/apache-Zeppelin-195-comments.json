Click the `JOB RUN` button in the submarine dashboard to submit all the algorithms in the entire note at one time.\r\n\r\nSo when the entire paragraph of the submarine dashboard is executed, you need to get the data from all the paragraphs in the entire note, and create a python file for the algorithm in each paragraph.\r\n\r\n![zepl-submarine-interactive-dev](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3677382/53459519-294ce280-3a75-11e9-936d-c19a7fb046cb.png)\r\n\r\n1.

I think the problem is that the memory issue is coming from the ipython kernel. (so it will not be the same process as far as I understand and I didnt find option to set memory limit in the kernel)\r\n\r\nHowever let me try with the link you shared.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/475520540/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/475549925","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/3336#issuecomment-475549925","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/3336","id":475549925,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NTU0OTkyNQ==","user":{"login":"AyWa","id":13608477,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjA4NDc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13608477?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AyWa","html_url":"https://github.com/AyWa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AyWa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AyWa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AyWa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AyWa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AyWa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AyWa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AyWa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AyWa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AyWa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-22T09:26:50Z","updated_at":"2019-10-22T12:02:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I am kind of lost with the test:\r\n- I ran my fix, without any new test -> all the test pass on the ci\r\n- I ran my fix, with the test scenario - > always some failure (seems like `GC` or out of memory or timeout)\r\n- I ran my fix, by adding a random test (with no concurrent call) -> always some failure\r\n\r\nSo i think the problem is not related to the fix itself, but more like an issue with the test:\r\n- `ExecutorService pool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);` make the `GC / OOM`  ?\r\n- running then auto complete make some issue ?
