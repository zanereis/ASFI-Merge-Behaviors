I am in favour of adding documentation together with the relevant code that is modified. \r\n\r\nEspecially in this case, this is a new way of building the DAG relationships which is the \"core\" of Airflow really and everyone should know how to use it. Having some PR / slack discussion describing such feature is really bad way of documenting it. Especially that this discussion was long and had many twists so it is unclear what the final intention was without reading the whole thread.\r\n\r\nAlso several other people had their strong opinions here so maybe it's good if everyone who participated will state their opinion on the current code. I don't think we all have to fully agree but maybe just one last round of comments would be great, then documentation should be added to reflect it and then we merge it. @zhongjiajie @feng-tao @Fokko @feluelle @mik-laj @XD-DENG ?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/492955694/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/492992751","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5289#issuecomment-492992751","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5289","id":492992751,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5Mjk5Mjc1MQ==","user":{"login":"mb-m","id":8926101,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MjYxMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8926101?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mb-m","html_url":"https://github.com/mb-m","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mb-m/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mb-m/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mb-m/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mb-m/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mb-m/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mb-m/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mb-m/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mb-m/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mb-m/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-16T09:29:37Z","updated_at":"2019-05-16T09:29:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"The CI failure here appears to have nothing to do with my patch 😢 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/492992751/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/492996735","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5289#issuecomment-492996735","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5289","id":492996735,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5Mjk5NjczNQ==","user":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-16T09:41:08Z","updated_at":"2019-05-16T09:41:33Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@mb-m -> are you sure you want to merge it to v1-10 branch ?

I fixed all the regular tests in #4938 and they are running for a while already - stable every time I rebase. The only remaining are kubernetes tests which I am going to fix shortly I hope.\r\n\r\nI have done the last round of fixes/updates:\r\n* shellcheck corrections to the scripts (thanks @mik-laj for the hints)\r\n* re-introduced mysql instead of mariadb (one of the export/import tests was failing with mariadb client)\r\n* i found a way to retain the usage of --chown at COPY so the image now is a bit smaller (previously I changed the ownership which caused duplication of source layer).\r\n\r\nI now need to merge this Step 2 to master, so that I can configure DockerHub to build 3.5 and 3.6 images so that I can switch to using them instead of my private images during the tests. Then the 3rd commit will.\r\n\r\nI think It makes sense to run tests for both 3.5 and 3.6 but I am open to only running it for one of those (preferably 3.6). \r\n\r\nOnce the tests are working I think we can also cherry-pick and backport the very same changes to \r\nv1-10-* branch and have separate CI images for the v1.10- series (I was testing it for python 2.7 as well). But I would do that only after we merge it fully to master. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/493862639/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/493863200","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5266#issuecomment-493863200","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5266","id":493863200,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5Mzg2MzIwMA==","user":{"login":"KevinYang21","id":7818710,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MTg3MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7818710?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21","html_url":"https://github.com/KevinYang21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-20T07:05:18Z","updated_at":"2019-05-20T07:05:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@r39132 Hi Sid, since we've deprecated the old UI and moved `www_rbac` to `www`, this is change is actually for the RBAC UI.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/493863200/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/493905802","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5293#issuecomment-493905802","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5293","id":493905802,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MzkwNTgwMg==","user":{"login":"AlexisBRENON","id":1846046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDYwNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1846046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexisBRENON","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexisBRENON","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexisBRENON/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexisBRENON/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexisBRENON/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexisBRENON/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexisBRENON/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexisBRENON/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexisBRENON/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexisBRENON/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexisBRENON/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-20T09:19:13Z","updated_at":"2019-05-20T09:19:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Addressed the error (`assert_called_once` is not available in all Python version, but it is weird as I use the docker image to test locally and it works.
