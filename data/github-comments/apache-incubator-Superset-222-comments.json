@mistercrunch since you've both mentioned it at one point or another, I pulled validate out to a separate endpoint.\r\n\r\nI think this is probably the right call in the long run since the more I think about it the less it makes sense to fuse validation in to the query path. For presto it's quite similar, but for any other validation scheme I can come up with it won't necessarily be. This also avoids conflating validation requests with query requests if you e.g. track 5xx response rate by endpoint.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI've also fixed up the unit tests and picked that commit in to this PR for review together.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOne remaining question on the backend side of this change — what's the right way to expose, from backend-to-frontend, whether or not the frontend should bother trying to call validate_sql_json at all for a given selected db?

We have 1.5M rows in query table since last June, the number is growing very fast. There may have over hundred ppl polling (and update) query status at the same time, for every second.
