mentioned in the PR description, I have introduced a new `get_regions` driver class method in 04dbe1891f7e3c90c5f5890f67d4f41c54f3a23b (other related changes - 2b2a79ccedefaf584beb463ac371f3d07e3e1f97, 3cb03ebb0d65854924b4866debed858f2b493e40).\n\nThis approach is not ideal since we already have `list_locations` methid, but the problem is `list_locations` tends to be user account specific (connection needs to be established to retrieve locations which are available for that particular user account) while `list_regions` returns global regions which tend to be the same for all the users (and this region argument is passed to the driver constructor before the connection to the provider is established).\n\nIn short - this means we now have two concepts - location and region.
