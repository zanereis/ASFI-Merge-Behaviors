Just wanted to offer a few thoughts.\r\n\r\nCurrently, we cannot open the Configure dialog while there are still active threads. This path forward moves away from that. We'd likely want to update the Configure context menu availability as well. The one benefit the current solution offers, however, is that if the processor is reporting any issues they are available via its bulletins. If we already have the Configuration dialog open there would be no way to see these. This is something that I hadn't even considered during my previous comments. We could also make these bulletins available, in addition to the active threads, but I wonder if it starts to get too muddled all in the Configuration dialog.\r\n\r\nNot sure, maybe it's not necessary.

are the remaining items that I think need to be addressed...\r\n\r\n1) Currently there is a recursive loop in createSolrClient that produces a StackOverflowException when starting a solr processor\r\n\r\n2) Currently SolrJ is brought in twice, once in nifi-solr-processors pom and again in nifi-solr-client-api pom, it needs to be removed from nifi-solr-processors since that will have a NAR dependency on the API\r\n\r\n3) Kerberos currently won't work using the client service because the code in the onTrigger of a processor has to be wrapped in a kerberos action:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfinal KerberosUser kerberosUser = getKerberosKeytabUser();\r\n        if (kerberosUser == null) {\r\n            doOnTrigger(context, session);\r\n        } else {\r\n            // wrap doOnTrigger in a privileged action\r\n            final PrivilegedAction action = () -> {\r\n                doOnTrigger(context, session);\r\n                return null;\r\n            };\r\n\r\n            // execute the privileged action as the given keytab user\r\n            final KerberosAction kerberosAction = new KerberosAction(kerberosUser, action, context, getLogger());\r\n            kerberosAction.execute();\r\n        }\r\n```\r\nI think we have to add a method to the client service to obtain the KerberosUser and then update SolrProcessor to use that KerberosUser when the service is set, or use the local one when service is not set.\r\n\r\n4) Currently the client service has a property for Collection, previously Collection supported expression language from flow file attributes, but it won't be able to do that when Collection is specified in the service.\r\n\r\nSo we can either remove Collection from the service and have it always be specified in the processor, or allow it in the service but we have to make a copy of the property descriptor and change the EL scope so the docs say only \"Variable Registry\".\r\n\r\nSince I think the long term goal would eventually be to remove all the overlapping properties from the processors, I think would lean towards leaving Collection in the processors which allows us to support collection per flow file.\r\n\r\n\r\n1 and 2 above, I resolved with the following changes:\r\nhttps://github.com/bbende/nifi/commit/6c8a7eb0d41446f9b312283d7c2a65fbe1bcc9c0\r\n\r\nFeel free to incorporate those into your PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/462413992/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/462429260","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3253#issuecomment-462429260","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3253","id":462429260,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MjQyOTI2MA==","user":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-11T18:00:36Z","updated_at":"2019-02-11T18:00:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1

A terminate prompt is on the Processor Configuration dialog \"Apply\" button as well, such that should the end user hit \"Apply\" and threads are still active, it will simply provide them an option to terminate or wait for the threads to finish normally. I believe this is a good solution to allow threads to naturally close out in the background as the user is making their changes. I did not institute an additional polling process to inspect the thread state, but rather simply synced the thread state value off the current canvas value for the component, since that interface already has a polling process active. Additionally, per @mcgilman suggestion, I added the Stop & Configure option to the context menu as well. Please take a test drive and let me know your feedback whenever you guys get a chance.

@patricker sorry for the delay in getting back to this. I looked into the unit tests, and did some quick profiling. It looks like the reason that it seemed to \"go out to lunch\" as you say was because of Mockito objects being used. They are super useful but don't provide great performance. I updated the test so that instead of using Mockito it just created simple objects like Funnels or implemented interfaces directly without much of anything happening. That resulted in much better performance.\r\n\r\nI updated the test about to run in multiple threads, as well, because this is where we are going to see the heavy contention and therefore the performance concerns. When I run with a single thread, we see pretty comparable results between the existing implementation and the new implementation that checks for penalization:\r\n\r\n> 1M checks for FlowFiles,

threads, each checking 1 million times, the difference in performance/latency goes from 2-3 seconds to 70-90 seconds.\r\n\r\nWe can also see what happens to the CPU utilization as it switches between the version that checks penalization and the one that doesn't:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/184268/52737399-3e684280-2f9a-11e9-94f7-6231a6077959.png)\r\n\r\nSo at one thread, I'm not concerned about the performance difference.
