Check released version `0.5.0` / `0.5.1` hudi version\r\n1) parse bytecode \r\n```\r\njar xf hudi-client-0.5.2-incubating.jar\r\njavap -v org/apache/hudi/index/bloom/BucketizedBloomCheckPartitioner.class | grep Math.floor\r\n```\r\n2) output\r\n```\r\n   #14 = Methodref          #184.#187     // java/lang/Math.floor:(D)D\r\n   #64 = Methodref          #184.#242     // java/lang/Math.floorMod:(JJ)J\r\n        88: invokestatic  #14                 // Method java/lang/Math.floor:(D)D\r\n        54: invokestatic  #64                 // Method java/lang/Math.floorMod:(JJ)J\r\n```\r\n3) from the output above, one thing we knew for certain was that official hudi-jar is ok.\r\n\r\n#### 6. Where is `java.lang.Math.floorMod(JI)I` from?\r\nAt last we found the answer, @EdwinGuo use `jdk11` build the hudi project and then run on `jdk8`, it may caused by `jdk11` jvm compile mechanism or `floorMod(JI)I` exists in jdk11.\r\n\r\n#### 7. End\r\nSo, the changes LGTM, thanks @EdwinGuo \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/606271560/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/606273609","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/1466#issuecomment-606273609","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1466","id":606273609,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwNjI3MzYwOQ==","user":{"login":"lamberken","id":20113411,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTEzNDEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20113411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken","html_url":"https://github.com/lamberken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-30T21:59:15Z","updated_at":"2020-03-30T22:00:34Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"hi @EdwinGuo I guess your email may be wrong, use `git config --list | grep email` to check.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20113411/77965931-ac91d500-7314-11ea-915b-e847312b99d4.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/606273609/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/606275930","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/1433#issuecomment-606275930","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1433","id":606275930,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwNjI3NTkzMA==","user":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-30T22:05:26Z","updated_at":"2020-03-30T22:05:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@vinothchandar : my bad.

In general, this may be worth adding support for in the new exporter tool cc @xushiyan ... wdyt? essentially, something that will preserve file names and just transform the data. \r\n\r\nFor now, even if you create those commit timeline files yourself in `.hoodie`, it may not work since the metadata inside will point to files that no longer exist in the new table..  Here's an approach that could work.. Writing a small program, that will \r\n\r\n- First copy the `.hoodie` folder to new table location\r\n- Then list all files (directly using fs.listStatus()) and filter them such that their commit time < latest commit time in the `.hoodie` folder you copied above\r\n- Read all files out using AvroParquetReader to get RDD[GenericRecord] (if it's MOR, we need more work), do your schema adjusting to

It currently supports copying Hudi dataset as is. With this migration use case, we could extend the feature to include transformation when `--output-format hudi`, using a custom `Transformer`.\r\n\r\nThough MOR is a bit troublesome with log files conversions, we could start with COW tables support? Does this work for your case? @symfrog \r\n\r\nAs for splitting/merging usecases, something feasible as well; some more logic to implement for exporter to take multiple source/target paths. Also some efforts to support multiple datasets in `Transformer` interface.\r\n\r\n@vinothchandar Are my thoughts above aligned with yours?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/609466504/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/609472838","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/1487#issuecomment-609472838","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1487","id":609472838,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwOTQ3MjgzOA==","user":{"login":"lamberken","id":20113411,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTEzNDEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20113411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken","html_url":"https://github.com/lamberken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-05T19:54:03Z","updated_at":"2020-04-05T19:54:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi, it works fine in my local env. steps:\r\n\r\n1.Add `spark-hive` dependency\r\n```\r\n<dependency>\r\n  <groupId>org.apache.spark</groupId>\r\n  <artifactId>spark-hive_${scala.binary.version}</artifactId>\r\n  <version>2.4.4</version>\r\n  <scope>compile</scope>\r\n</dependency>\r\n\r\nSparkSession spark = SparkSession\r\n    .builder()\r\n    .appName(\"FeatureExtractor\")\r\n    .config(\"spark.master\", \"local\")\r\n    .config(\"spark.sql.hive.convertMetastoreParquet\", false)\r\n    .config(\"spark.submit.deployMode\", \"client\")\r\n    .config(\"spark.jars.packages\", \"org.apache.spark:spark-avro_2.11:2.4.4\")\r\n    .config(\"spark.sql.warehouse.dir\", \"/user/hive/warehouse\")\r\n    .config(\"hive.metastore.uris\", \"thrift://hivemetastore:9083\")\r\n    .enableHiveSupport()\r\n    .getOrCreate();\r\n\r\nspark.sql(\"select * from stock_ticks_cow\").show(100);\r\n```\r\n\r\n2.Build fatjar\r\n```\r\nmvn package\r\n```\r\n\r\n3.Copy to `adhoc-1` docker\r\n```\r\ndocker cp test.jar  adhoc-1:/opt/spark\r\n```\r\n\r\n4.Run test.jar\r\n```\r\nbin/spark-submit \\\r\n--class com.TestExample \\\r\n--executor-memory 1G \\\r\n--total-executor-cores 2 \\\r\ntest.jar\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/609472838/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/609480755","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/1486#issuecomment-609480755","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1486","id":609480755,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwOTQ4MDc1NQ==","user":{"login":"pratyakshsharma","id":30863489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwODYzNDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30863489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma","html_url":"https://github.com/pratyakshsharma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-05T20:52:21Z","updated_at":"2020-04-05T20:52:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/609480755/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
