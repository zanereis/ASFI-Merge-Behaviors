Executor is the basic unit of parallism, suppose executor number is the same, adding a worker will add more traffic, but if it is co-located with other worker, it may also increase the bandwith of intra-worker communication(as we do intra-process communication instead of intra-machine).\n\nFor example, 1, 1, 1 (means 3 machine, one worker on each) may be faster than co-located 4, 4, 4\nBut co-located 3, 0, 0 may be faster than distributed 1, 1, 1. This requires experiment to verify it is better or worse.\n\n> And i think using several netty threads working in sync and non-batch mode may have some what the same effect with using only one netty threads working in async and batch mode. Maybe i should test this out.

We have certain data in our stream that can trigger spikes in execution latency for a bolt.  This data cannot be separated into its own stream beforehand, so some bolt instances are hot spotting and queuing up.  This requires us to increase tuple timeout to allow the queued up tuples to reach the end of the topology before being replayed.  This is bad in failure scenarios because it takes forever for throughput to recover when workers are killed, as the lost messages have to hit the super high timeout before being

Hadoop, you should exclude the Hadoop libraries from the storm-hdfs dependency<br/>\n    +and add the dependencies for your preferred version in your pom.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +Hadoop client version incompatibilites can manifest as errors like:<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +```<br/>\n    +com.google.protobuf.InvalidProtocolBufferException: Protocol message contained an invalid tag (zero)<br/>\n    +```<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +## Customization<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +### Record Formats<br/>\n    +Record format can be controlled by providing an implementation of the `org.apache.storm.hdfs.format.RecordFormat`<br/>\n    +interface:<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +```java<br/>\n    +public interface RecordFormat extends Serializable </p>\n{\n    +    byte[] format(Tuple tuple);\n    +}\n<p>    +```<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +The provided `org.apache.storm.hdfs.format.DelimitedRecordFormat` is capable of producing formats such as CSV and<br/>\n    +tab-delimited files.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +### File Naming<br/>\n    +File naming can be controlled by providing an implementation of the `org.apache.storm.hdfs.format.FileNameFormat`<br/>\n    +interface:<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +```java<br/>\n    +public interface FileNameFormat extends Serializable </p>\n{\n    +    void prepare(Map conf, TopologyContext topologyContext);\n    +    String getName(long rotation, long timeStamp);\n    +    String getPath();\n    +}\n<p>    +```<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +The provided `org.apache.storm.hdfs.format.DefaultFileNameFormat`  will create file names with the following format:<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +     </p>\n{prefix}\n{componentId}\n<p>-</p>\n{taskId}\n<p>-</p>\n{rotationNum}\n<p>-</p>\n{timestamp}\n{extension}\n<p>    +<br/>\n    +For example:<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +     MyBolt-5-7-1390579837830.txt<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +By default, prefix is empty and extenstion is \".txt\".<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +### Sync Policies<br/>\n    +Sync policies allow you to control when buffered data is flushed to the underlying filesystem (thus making it available<br/>\n    +to clients reading the data) by implementing the `org.apache.storm.hdfs.sync.SyncPolicy` interface:<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +```java<br/>\n    +public interface SyncPolicy extends Serializable </p>\n{\n    +    boolean mark(Tuple tuple, long offset);\n    +    void reset();\n    +}<br/>\n    +```<br/>\n    +The `HdfsBolt` will call the `mark()` method for every tuple it processes.
