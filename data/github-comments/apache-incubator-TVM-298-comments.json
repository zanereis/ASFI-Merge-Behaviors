so that it can force pooling.cc to use the new_in_layout as the new param->layout instead if it is defined or not?\r\n  *   tests/python/relay/test_pass_alter_op_layout.py – by making similar changes as I did to the tvm/tests/python/relay/test_pass_convert_op_layout.py test suite.\r\n\r\n… Please advice so that I can continue and then resolve this PR.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot !\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   Joe\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom: Joe Chou\r\nSent: Monday, October 11, 2021 12:05 PM\r\nTo: apache/tvm ***@***.***>; apache/tvm ***@***.***>\r\nCc: Author ***@***.***>\r\nSubject: RE: [EXT] Re: [apache/tvm] [bug] pooling convert layout bug in pooling.cc and in test_pass_conve… (see also issue #8848) (#9235)\r\n\r\nYes and I am trying to reproduce them locally in order to find resolutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   Joe\r\n\r\nFrom: Wuwei Lin ***@***.******@***.***>>\r\nSent: Monday, October 11, 2021 12:00 PM\r\nTo: apache/tvm ***@***.******@***.***>>\r\nCc: Joe Chou ***@***.******@***.***>>; Author ***@***.******@***.***>>\r\nSubject: [EXT] Re: [apache/tvm] [bug] pooling convert layout bug in pooling.cc and in test_pass_conve… (see also issue #8848) (#9235)\r\n\r\nExternal Email\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nThere are some failing test cases on CI that relate to this change\r\n\r\n—\r\nYou are receiving this because you authored the thread.\r\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__github.com_apache_tvm_pull_9235-23issuecomment-2D940364473&d=DwMCaQ&c=nKjWec2b6R0mOyPaz7xtfQ&r=84zI-iH2xz28Q_xujSGbjYaq38CgcRgl_vGzCtF6TwQ&m=escaZCs9wQeKyQiDz74nwKHPHsm5mss21WkH6-ffeSk&s=Mdy5MIJStP_P1-hkWJjXslSooRthmG2tR48tsd6o5Tg&e=>, or unsubscribe<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__github.com_notifications_unsubscribe-2Dauth_AM636PADO63ICYSJVE5VHLLUGMXZFANCNFSM5FUWAG4A&d=DwMCaQ&c=nKjWec2b6R0mOyPaz7xtfQ&r=84zI-iH2xz28Q_xujSGbjYaq38CgcRgl_vGzCtF6TwQ&m=escaZCs9wQeKyQiDz74nwKHPHsm5mss21WkH6-ffeSk&s=GGqpJDj2F6zu0XWc28cFTudrEPooKQUKfAiBQoZlecA&e=>.\r\nTriage notifications on the go with GitHub Mobile for iOS<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__apps.apple.com_app_apple-2Dstore_id1477376905-3Fct-3Dnotification-2Demail-26mt-3D8-26pt-3D524675&d=DwMCaQ&c=nKjWec2b6R0mOyPaz7xtfQ&r=84zI-iH2xz28Q_xujSGbjYaq38CgcRgl_vGzCtF6TwQ&m=escaZCs9wQeKyQiDz74nwKHPHsm5mss21WkH6-ffeSk&s=xoFKW0tfvMfEkDFOnw9BnAhKtdJVug-1lHe6Arsxh-c&e=> or Android<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__play.google.com_store_apps_details-3Fid-3Dcom.github.android-26referrer-3Dutm-5Fcampaign-253Dnotification-2Demail-2526utm-5Fmedium-253Demail-2526utm-5Fsource-253Dgithub&d=DwMCaQ&c=nKjWec2b6R0mOyPaz7xtfQ&r=84zI-iH2xz28Q_xujSGbjYaq38CgcRgl_vGzCtF6TwQ&m=escaZCs9wQeKyQiDz74nwKHPHsm5mss21WkH6-ffeSk&s=W1tjMqF4DUukbs-p5E7Zxx507jXS0S3LEDr_tHLx0Ig&e=>.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/943494906/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/943495292","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7919#issuecomment-943495292","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7919","id":943495292,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM44PJh8","user":{"login":"areusch","id":532957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/532957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch","html_url":"https://github.com/areusch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-14T15:59:49Z","updated_at":"2021-10-14T15:59:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@junrushao1994 ok, if you want to do this i'd strongly encourage you to consider whether it's worth the complexity of multi-threading in c++ (it certainly could be, but the GIL is a pretty easy way to nix any threading benefits :) and Python can quickly destroy any cache locality you may have leveraged in multi-threaded apps). \r\n\r\ni am guessing you want to call `PyMem_RawMalloc`? I do see in the [docs](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/memory.html#raw-memory-interface): \r\n> The following function sets are wrappers to the system allocator. These functions are thread-safe, the GIL does not need to be held.\r\n\r\ndoes your question still apply to this specific use case? in general, this callback function, although named due to Python, isn't so specific to Python and is more specific to syscall restart behavior and signal processing.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/943495292/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/943507414","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/9268#issuecomment-943507414","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/9268","id":943507414,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM44PMfW","user":{"login":"zhaiyi000","id":61309244,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMzA5MjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61309244?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaiyi000","html_url":"https://github.com/zhaiyi000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaiyi000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaiyi000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaiyi000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaiyi000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaiyi000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaiyi000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaiyi000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaiyi000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaiyi000/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-14T16:13:25Z","updated_at":"2021-10-14T16:13:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@echuraev, I recompiled libtvm.dylib and libtvm_runtime.dylib, specifying `-DUSE_METAL=ON -DUSE_COREML=ON`.

I would like to request a change in how the links are handled. Instead of direct links, can we please use Sphinx reference links? This will help prevent breaks in the future.\r\n\r\nFor example, this file has a reference at the top of it:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/217763279371bc8eec4b61152e8b2deaef4b8a8c/gallery/how_to/tune_with_autotvm/tune_relay_x86.py#L18\r\n\r\nWe can write the link to that as:\r\n\r\n```\r\n:ref:`Auto-tuning a convolution network for x86 CPU <tune_relay_x86>`.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will make the link more durable and less likely to break if the files are ever moved again. [There is documentation for Sphinx that describes this feature more fully](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/cross-referencing-with-sphinx.html). This would be a great start on that.

For example, previously I encountered the issue (#7730) that CuBLAS batch_matmul implementation doesn't supports implicit broadcasting, which results in errors when lowering batch_matmul to CuBLAS.\r\n\r\nIf we allow arbitrary dimension in `relay.nn.dense`, which means implicitly reshaping actually, we need to make sure all supported implementations follow this semantic. Considering Relay graph should be as general as possible to be compatible with arbitrary backends, simplify the operator semantic and make extra behaviors as explicit as possible seems more developer friendly. On the other hand, if supporting arbitrary dimension is a common sense for `dense`, then we could definitely go with it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/943642546/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/943644754","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/9235#issuecomment-943644754","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/9235","id":943644754,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM44PuBS","user":{"login":"comaniac","id":8262694,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNjI2OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8262694?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac","html_url":"https://github.com/comaniac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-14T19:08:52Z","updated_at":"2021-10-14T19:08:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Sure, thanks for you feedback and I will do both as your comments have described.\r\n> FYI – This is the first PR, which our ML compiler team in Marvell is providing.

Moreover, things look more complicated than I thought yesterday, as pointed out by @comaniac and discussed below. Making sure that N-D input dense is supported by external backends is a really good point. It is kind of odd I didn't think about it yesterday because I was trying to fuse 3-D dense + activation for cutlass byoc. Now I realized that I don't even know if cutlass supports such N-D dense operation.\r\n\r\n@comaniac N-D dense input is common in all frameworks so we should definitely support it. My hope is that since those extra batch dimensions can be conceptually fused into 1D batch dim, external libs can directly work on N-D input, i.e. whether or not we explicitly do reshape doesn't change underlying memory addresses. I guess PyTorch simply uses `tensor.view(...)` before sending inputs to cublas. I think we can do a similar trick you did to support implicit broadcasting in the past. \r\n\r\nOther related points I realized now:\r\n* `batch_matmul` has the same problem. Our `batch_matmul` only supports 3-D inputs, while other frameworks support arbitrary number of batch dims as long as corresponding dims are compatible. Huggingface `bert-large` has 48 `batch_matmul`, all of which are not fused with the following elemwise ops due to `reshape`.\r\n* We should also update `qnn.dense` and `qnn.batch_matmul`.\r\n* Our tensorcore schedules have to check the size of the batch dim to decide if they are applicable. If there are multiple batch dims, we need to take them into account by multiplying them. The change is trivial but we have to touch a lot of code, e.g this includes tensorcore `legalize` utility that tries to pad batch dim to multiple of 8.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/943689791/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/943695278","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/8412#issuecomment-943695278","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8412","id":943695278,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM44P6Wu","user":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-14T20:15:09Z","updated_at":"2021-10-14T20:15:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Another workaround that allows dense + activation without supporting N-D dense is to swap the order of reshape and activations.

The main reason I didn't use `ScheduleToModule` directly was because it calls `sch.normalize()`, whereas [`auto_scheduler`'s feature extraction](https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/main/src/auto_scheduler/feature.cc#L1271) requires `sch.normalize_for_feature_extraction()`.\r\n\r\nThat said, it looks like calling `sch.normalize()` after calling `sch.normalize_for_feature_extraction()` has no effect, so those use cases could still use `ScheduleToModule` so long as they normalize the schedule first.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/944342957/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/944345195","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/9299#issuecomment-944345195","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/9299","id":944345195,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM44SZBr","user":{"login":"Mousius","id":4933431,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MzM0MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4933431?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius","html_url":"https://github.com/Mousius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-15T14:25:25Z","updated_at":"2021-10-15T14:25:25Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"hi @lhutton1, thanks for fixing this.

you for bringing this up!  Indeed we will need to make the condition stronger here such that under a weak ssa form, we would require the related expressions to do not call into function that have side effect or write into a state.\n\nNote that by default store have to appear in a Stmt so the case of memory write won't interleave with the two lets\n\nYou are right that it is also think about whether or not such form was indeed necessary. The let expr is useful when it comes to express values that are CSEed.\n\nIn the case of TIR, we do want to restrict where can effectful operations appear(hopefully in let statement, or eval) so the impact is minimized and most Expr can remain
