If the script directory is not available (e.g. if the interpreter is invoked interactively or if the script is read from standard input), path[0] is the empty string, which directs Python to search modules in the current directory first.

it be possible to store the PIDs of the workers inside of PythonWorkerFactory and directly kill the workers via SIGTERM?  Or send a command to the Python daemon and have it kill the workers?  That seems like it would be less complex than this socket-polling approach.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50693477/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50693514","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/600#issuecomment-50693514","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/600","id":50693514,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNjkzNTE0","user":{"login":"pwendell","id":320616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDYxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/320616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell","html_url":"https://github.com/pwendell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-30T23:16:23Z","updated_at":"2014-07-30T23:16:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I

The only awkward thing is that calling cache() on an RDD of InputStreams wouldn't work, but hopefully this is obvious (and will be documented).
