believe failing test is due to the shutdown taking slightly longer than the given 1s.

In response to your general comment:\r\n\r\n> General comment is that StateStore should not know about 'current'...\r\n> The StateStore should exposed APIs used at the DatasetStateStore level to access the last modified state.\r\n\r\nThe StateStore does expose an API to access current: `getCurrent` and `getAllCurrent`.  Additionally, the `createAlias` API has been removed.  In order to support a seamless upgrade, StateStore, also supports the prior `get*` calls being called with a filename like `current`.  In this case it will perform the same as the `getCurrent`/`getAllCurrent` calls.  The logic behind this is that I cannot be sure that there are no dependencies from third-party libraries on the existing `get*` calls.  By making the change in this way, we can get rid of the `current` aliased files, while still ensuring existing code will work. We can publish in release note that callers need to upgrade to the latest API.\r\n\r\n> ...

: Here is a simpler approach to accomplish this. I looked at KafkaAvroExtractor and followed the pattern from there. \r\n\r\nFirst in KafkaDeserializerExtractor: \r\n cache the latest schema for the topic in a private member variable (say this.latestSchema) using the same strategy as KafkaAvroExtractor. \r\n\r\nThen in KafkaDeserializerExtractor::decodeRecord\r\n\r\nFirst get the native deserialized object from the deserializer\r\nObject deserialized = this.kafkaDeserializer.deserialize(this.topicName, messageAndOffset.getMessageBytes());\r\n\r\nThen coerce this object to be compatible with the latest schema using gobblin.util.AvroUtils\r\nYou might have to do an instanceof GenericRecord check before this.\r\n\r\nGenericRecord upconvertedRecord = gobblin.util.AvroUtils.convertRecordSchema((GenericRecord) deserialized, this.latestSchema)\r\nreturn upconvertedRecord;\r\n\r\n\r\nThis should result in a much smaller code patch and hopefully accomplishes the same results.
