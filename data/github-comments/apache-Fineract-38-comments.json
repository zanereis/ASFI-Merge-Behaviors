Modify of loan account is not working  with 'semi month' configuration\r\nERROR:- \" field is required Loan term frequency period type must match that of repayment frequency period type. -\"\r\n\r\n2. First date and last date tooltip is showing wrong info\r\n- minor issue, but could be misleading for initial users during configuration\r\n\r\n3. Loan creation fails when 'First' and 'Last dates' are not mentioned at the product level, However, those fields are not mandatory to add at the Product level.\r\n- If we create the loan product without adding 'First' and 'Last dates', we cannot create a loan application\r\n\r\n4. Validation for \"Repaid Every\" Number field. when 'Semi month' is selected\r\nRight now we can select 1 semi month, 3 semi month etc, which intern affecting the logic of loan term and number of repayments\r\n\r\nFor example\r\nIf we set \"loan term\" as 10 months\r\nand \"repaid every\" as 3 semi months\r\n\"No of repayments\" will be set to 30 instalments.\r\nBecause of 'semi month' configuration, there would be 30 instalments for loan spread across 15 months.\r\nSo this breaks the existing logic of  \"loan term\"  = \"No of repayments\"/\"repaid every\" \r\n\r\nWe understand that user should know that semi months constitutes to 2 instalments per month, hence the number field should be frozen to 2 of \"repaid every\" when \"semi month\" is selected.\r\n\r\n5. System doesn't allow to create loans with disbursement date greater than the first date set at the loan product level\r\n- for example, if we set the first date as 5th may 2021, the system doesn't allow to create a loan with disbursement date greater than 5th May 2021\r\n\r\n6. The start date acts as a first repayment date, meaning even if we give the disbursement date as 1st Jan 2021, the system will still consider 5th may as the First repayment date(unless we specify the FRD while creating the loan application).\r\nIdeally, the system should follow instalments as per the frequency set\r\n\r\n7. No option to change 'first date' and 'last date' at the loan account level, 5th and 6th issues are only because of configuration present only at the product level.\r\n\r\n8. Interest portion is all zero when we set the interest calculation to 'daily' or 'same as repayment' with' Calculate interest for exact days in partial period' enabled\r\n- not sure if this is a bug or all the types have not been covered, as of now, system is not calculating interest when interest calculation to 'daily' or 'same as repayment' with' Calculate interest for exact days in partial period' enabled\r\nPlease feel free to reach out to me if you need any clarification on any point, I'll be happy to help in ggt\r\n-
