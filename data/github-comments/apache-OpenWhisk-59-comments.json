When output has to pass through docker itself and the volume of data is large, the output can be delayed significantly causing the invoker to be stalled.  There is no guarantee after an action is finished that Docker has necessarily made the output available and the more complex the log driver, the greater the expected and actual delay.  In a multi-tenant system that will be under a heavy and churning load, this problem can become severe and we ended up looking directly at the file system (/var/docker) to get the logs in the fastest possible manner so that writeback and end-to-end latency can be minimized. \r\n\r\nOther issues with log-driver include memory leaks and interference with docker's global lock.   There is a general pattern where the more logic has to run in docker, the slower basic docker operations can become.  When we were using other log drivers and the system was under heavy load by churning containers as fast as possible, docker ps could take several seconds to respond making administrative tasks on the invoker unacceptably slow.  It's possible that fluentd+docker1.12 no longer has these issues but it would be a very significant change that would require a lot of correctness (under load) and performance testing to prove no performance degradation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/276687608/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/276688695","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/1733#issuecomment-276688695","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/1733","id":276688695,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NjY4ODY5NQ==","user":{"login":"csantanapr","id":1094878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTQ4Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1094878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr","html_url":"https://github.com/csantanapr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-01T15:33:11Z","updated_at":"2017-02-01T15:33:11Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@mdeuser could you review latest changes, I added you as a reviewer.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/276688695/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/276695339","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/1791#issuecomment-276695339","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/1791","id":276695339,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NjY5NTMzOQ==","user":{"login":"markusthoemmes","id":1289147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODkxNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1289147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes","html_url":"https://github.com/markusthoemmes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-01T15:55:56Z","updated_at":"2017-02-01T15:56:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Just wanted to do the same.

proposal:\r\n\r\nhigh-level sketch here, low-level details to be discussed.\r\n\r\nWe create a built-in system feed in the whisk.system package, called 'exception'.   Define the set of abnormal exit conditions to be, for example, E := { 'error', 'abort' }.     You can instantiate the exception feed for action A and exit condition C, which causes the system feed to fire a trigger when A exits with condition C.\r\n\r\nSo to install an exception handler the user creates a rule to handle the exception feed.\r\n\r\nNote that this solution is a fire-and-forget asynchronous approach to exception handling.     It does not allow action composition with exception handlers in composed actions, so is weaker than lexically scoped exception handling in a language.    However, this proposal seems like a less ambitious, less disruptive change to the programming model. as compared to a new construct for scoped exception handling with composition.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/276792762/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/276820290","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/1781#issuecomment-276820290","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/1781","id":276820290,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NjgyMDI5MA==","user":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-01T23:43:20Z","updated_at":"2017-02-01T23:43:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"rebased and squashed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/276820290/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/276825736","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/1795#issuecomment-276825736","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/1795","id":276825736,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NjgyNTczNg==","user":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-02T00:12:27Z","updated_at":"2017-02-02T00:12:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"make it 10.seconds. no pg needed again.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/276825736/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/276826238","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/1788#issuecomment-276826238","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/1788","id":276826238,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NjgyNjIzOA==","user":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-02T00:15:29Z","updated_at":"2017-02-02T00:15:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@dubeejw LG.

Options are: That's what we started :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/276929509/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/276930895","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/1783#issuecomment-276930895","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/1783","id":276930895,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NjkzMDg5NQ==","user":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-02T11:16:15Z","updated_at":"2017-02-02T11:16:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Excellent!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/276930895/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/276932099","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/1793#issuecomment-276932099","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/1793","id":276932099,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NjkzMjA5OQ==","user":{"login":"mbehrendt","id":4745697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDU2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4745697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbehrendt","html_url":"https://github.com/mbehrendt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbehrendt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbehrendt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbehrendt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbehrendt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbehrendt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbehrendt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbehrendt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbehrendt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbehrendt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-02T11:22:47Z","updated_at":"2017-02-02T11:22:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"well, you just changed the scenario to require the more general try/catch mechanism :-) .

would throw a `TokenExpirationException`, and the sequence-level handler would match on it, and communicate with the client.\r\n\r\nin their absence, do we just \"pay the piper\", and force every action to be a participant in a particular client protocol (http, in my example)? or is there some way to separate the concerns, so that `B` knows only about token expiration, and the sequence (being web-exported) handles the protocol issues...\r\n\r\nwhatever we do, some change will be needed to the core. because, right now, it tosses a 400 back to the client, no matter what happens. i've worked around this, for now, by interpreting the body of 400 responses.\r\n\r\nin that sense, i've achieved a partial victory, in that `B` knows nothing about http! however, we've lost the ability to clear server-side (a.k.a. \"Secure\") cookies, and do proper redirects.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/276947813/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/276951700","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/1793#issuecomment-276951700","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/1793","id":276951700,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3Njk1MTcwMA==","user":{"login":"starpit","id":4741620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDE2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4741620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/starpit","html_url":"https://github.com/starpit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/starpit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/starpit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/starpit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/starpit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/starpit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/starpit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/starpit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/starpit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/starpit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-02T13:04:01Z","updated_at":"2017-02-02T13:04:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"i

I like the Promise based example of being able to attach a `catch()` equivalent to a sequence that handles the rejection and would be able to return the expected HTTP response for failure cases like this. \r\nS1: A -> B -> C\r\n     errors   -> D\r\n\r\nD would return` {statusCode: 403, message: \"some error message\"}`.\r\n\r\nAt a later point, I might want to add authentication to this service. Rather than having to manually update A to handle this (which would be replicated in every sequence), I would create a new action (E) that handles this. If authentication passes, it just returns input parameters, other it throws the rejection. \r\n\r\nThis would allow me to define a new sequence, S2, adding auth onto my service with minimal effort. I could use this pattern for adding auth to any service. \r\n\r\nS2: E -> S1 \r\n\r\nThis second sequence would not have a`catch()` path defined.
