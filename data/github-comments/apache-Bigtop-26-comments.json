It can work with any path that HDFS can resolve, such as file:/// or s3:/. Its purpose is to make it convenient for the HBase JVM to load the JAR file.\r\nyarn FlowRunTableRW.java\r\nThis coprocessor JAR is primarily used in the code for creating the FlowRunTable in YARN.\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/bigtop/assets/18082602/83555c2c-90e7-484d-9866-f9d75e7276e9)\r\n\r\nhbase HTableDescriptor.java\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/bigtop/assets/18082602/5a10de01-6a44-45a2-b47e-b3da7711acff)\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/bigtop/assets/18082602/2ad8ffdf-b8ef-463f-abb1-a69562b65ce3)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Ambari, a local path is used, following this pattern: yarn_timeline_jar_location = format(\"file://{stack_root}/{version}/usr/lib/hadoop-yarn/timelineservice/{coprocessor_jar_name}\"). This approach is the simplest; it avoids the need to upload the JAR to HDFS. While uploading is still an option, hardcoding the version number in the code can complicate future maintenance.

`-Dbuildwithdeps=true` kicks packging of products depended by hadoop (such as bigtop-utils and zookeeper).\r\n* `-Pdocker-run-option=\"--privileged\"` is needed on the Fedora-35 and Ubuntu-22.04 now (depending on the version of systemd).\r\n* `-Pmvn-cache-volume=true` attaches docker volume to reuse local repository (~/.m2) to make repeatable build
