The actual message does correctly have lengthKind=\"delimited\".\r\n\r\nThe question I had was why does the DFDL spec say ``ES`` can never be used in the ``dfdl:separator`` property, but it can be used in the ``dfdl:terminator`` property as long as it isn't alone as one of the string literals when lengthKind=\"delimited\"? What's the usecase for ever needing ES in ``dfdl:terminator``?\r\n\r\nBut thinking about it, I guess the usecase is an optional terminator with with non-delimited lengths. So something like ``dfdl:terminator=\"FOO %ES;\"`` seems reasonable when lengthKind is not delimited. So I guess I answered my own question.\r\n\r\nSo @regetom, I think this does mean we need two separate Cookers. One is needed for cooking separators that is called DelimiterCookerNoES (same as what you have now), and one called something like DelimterCookerNoSoleES which is like the old DelimiterCookerNoES (has no restriction on character class, with the only restriction being sole ES/WSP*).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/801093746/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/801168012","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/502#issuecomment-801168012","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/502","id":801168012,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwMTE2ODAxMg==","user":{"login":"stevedlawrence","id":3180601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODA2MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3180601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence","html_url":"https://github.com/stevedlawrence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-17T15:17:10Z","updated_at":"2021-03-17T15:17:10Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Saxon provides some detailed information here: https://www.saxonica.com/documentation/#!conditions, which mentions this:\r\n\r\n> If you produce a product that includes or requires Saxon-HE, please refer to it prominently as \"The Saxon XSLT and XQuery Processor from Saxonica Limited\", and include the URL of the home page, which is at http://www.saxonica.com/.

For that, I would probably include the Saxon license like we include other stuff, and then at the same indention level, nest in the Saxon subcomonent \"notices\"/licenses, so somthing like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThis product bundels Saxon ... available under MPL license:\r\n\r\n  Copy MPL license here:\r\n\r\n  SAXON SUBCOMPONENTS\r\n\r\n  Saxon contains subcomponents with separate coyright noticess....\r\n\r\n    Saxon bundles ABC, this is available under the MIT license:\r\n      Copy MIT licnse here\r\n\r\n    Saxon bundels XYZ, this is avialabel under the BSD license:\r\n      Copy BSD license here\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo we sort of have nested licenses so it's clear which parts come from saxon and which parts don't.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/801267776/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/801286875","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/481#issuecomment-801286875","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/481","id":801286875,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwMTI4Njg3NQ==","user":{"login":"mbeckerle","id":1524099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1524099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle","html_url":"https://github.com/mbeckerle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-17T17:50:40Z","updated_at":"2021-03-17T17:50:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I can comment from the DFDL specification and workgroup perspective.\n\nThe use case is indeed that where the length kind is something like 'pattern', and depending on the length, a terminator somewhere needs to be present or absent.\n\nThis comes up in formats where a string can be say, up to 50 characters long, where if it is exactly 50 characters long, there is no terminator (%ES; case), but if it is less than 50 characters long, a specific character like DEL (x7F) is the terminator. The VMF format (mil-std-6017) is an example of a format that has this kind of strings.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n  <xs:group name=\"tString50\">\n    <xs:sequence>\n      <xs:element name=\"value\" type=\"xs:string\" dfdl:lengthKind=\"pattern\"\n        dfdl:lengthPattern=\"[^\\x7F]{0,49}(?=\\x7F)|.{50}\" />\n      <xs:sequence\n        dfdl:terminator=\"{if (fn:string-length(./value) eq 50) then '%ES;' else '%DEL;'}\" />\n    </xs:sequence>\n  </xs:group>\n\nNote that the regex for the pattern is using look-ahead to see if it finds the DEL terminator or not without consuming it as part of the length. That's the trick here.\n\nThe dfdl:separator property does not offer this same possibility of using %ES; because a separator doesn't necessarily act like a terminator, (e.g., separatorPosition 'prefix' is a blend of initiator and terminator) doesn't have many of the associated properties like emptyValueDelimiterPolicy controlling it, but does have entirely different properties related to separator suppression. Disallowing %ES; was just a conservative design choice. In the future it is possible to relax this restriction if all the nuances of property interaction could be worked out. But separators are just so different from terminators that without a compelling use case that cannot be equivalently modeled as terminators, the complexity did not seem worth it.\n\n________________________________\nFrom: Steve Lawrence ***@***.***>\nSent: Wednesday, March 17, 2021 9:47 AM\nTo: apache/daffodil ***@***.***>\nCc: Beckerle, Mike ***@***.***>; Mention ***@***.***>\nSubject: Re: [apache/daffodil] ADD test for \"%%\" to bypass existing test for \"%NL\" (#481)\n\n\nI think lengthKind=\"terminator\" was a typo. The actual message does correctly have lengthKind=\"delimited\".\n\nThe question I had was why does the DFDL spec say ES can never be used in the dfdl:separator property, but it can be used in the dfdl:terminator property as long as it isn't alone as one of the string literals when lengthKind=\"delimited\"? What's the usecase for ever needing ES in dfdl:terminator?\n\nBut thinking about it, I guess the usecase is an optional terminator with with non-delimited lengths. So something like dfdl:terminator=\"FOO %ES;\" seems reasonable when lengthKind is not delimited. So I guess I answered my own question.\n\nSo @regetom<https://github.com/regetom>, I think this does mean we need two separate Cookers. One is needed for cooking separators that is called DelimiterCookerNoES (same as what you have now), and one called something like DelimterCookerNoSoleES which is like the old DelimiterCookerNoES (has no restriction on character class, with the only restriction being sole ES/WSP*).\n\nâ€”\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub<https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/481#issuecomment-801093746>, or unsubscribe<https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AALUDA436XI2IUXEDMLTJVTTECXFXANCNFSM4WSD6HJQ>.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/801286875/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/801292930","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/481#issuecomment-801292930","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/481","id":801292930,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwMTI5MjkzMA==","user":{"login":"stevedlawrence","id":3180601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODA2MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3180601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence","html_url":"https://github.com/stevedlawrence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-17T17:59:35Z","updated_at":"2021-03-17T17:59:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for the background Mike.

Maybe this solves some issue by just being on the classpath? From the readme of jansi, that doesn't sound like it's the case. Sounds like you have to use some Jansi function for this library to have an affect.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/801928222/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/801942643","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/514#issuecomment-801942643","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/514","id":801942643,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwMTk0MjY0Mw==","user":{"login":"tuxji","id":5915561,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MTU1NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5915561?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuxji","html_url":"https://github.com/tuxji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuxji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuxji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuxji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuxji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuxji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuxji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuxji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuxji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuxji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-18T13:46:54Z","updated_at":"2021-03-18T13:46:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I checked [JLine](https://github.com/jline/jline3)'s README.

I had to define noCharClassEntities() otherwise the compiler complained that \"context\" and \"raw\" did not exist.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure why you get this error, but nothing calls ``noCharClassEntities``. You have removed all calls of it, which I think is correct. The ``testRaw`` function is the only that that does anything now. So adding the ``noCharClassEntities`` probably isn't the right solution, and we need to bring the ``testRaw`` function back, since that's what actually does tests.\r\n\r\nIn your current pull request that you've pushed, if I change\r\n```scala\r\nprotected def noCharClassEntities(...)\r\n```\r\nto\r\n```scala\r\noverride def testRaw(...)\r\n```\r\nthen it compiles without any errors. And if I update ``Cookers.scala`` to use this new cooker:\r\n```scala\r\nobject TerminatorCookerNoES extends DelimiterCookerNoSoleES(\"terminator\")\r\n```\r\nand run the test you mention, then I do get the error error:\r\n\r\n> The ES entity cannot appear on its own when dfdl:lengthKind=\"delimited\r\n\r\nWhich seems right to me. Unfortunately, the test still fails because the TDML test expects ``dfdl:terminator`` in the error message, but that's expected since the new error message no longer includes that information (we should probably add that back to the error message). But with those changes I mentioned, it does seem to be doing the right test and detecting the sole ES.\r\n\r\nOne additional suggestion that I just noticed: In the new ``DelimiterCookerNoSoleES``, the ``oneLiteralCooker`` member is a ``StringLiteralNoCharClassEntities``. That class implies that there are some char class entities that are never allowed. But that isn't really the case with our new ``NoSoleES`` cooker. That new cooker allows all entities, but just has a special restriction on how some can be used. Since we don't need any of the logic associated with ``StringLiteralNoCharClassEntities``, we should just make it a ``StringLiteralBase``, for the new ``NoSoleES`` cooker:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n  override val oneLiteralCooker: StringLiteralBase =\r\n    new StringLiteralBase(propName, true) {\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/804849585/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/804945253","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/481#issuecomment-804945253","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/481","id":804945253,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwNDk0NTI1Mw==","user":{"login":"regetom","id":11149210,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTQ5MjEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11149210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/regetom","html_url":"https://github.com/regetom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regetom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regetom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regetom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regetom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regetom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regetom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regetom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regetom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regetom/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-23T14:24:29Z","updated_at":"2021-03-23T14:24:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I changed object TerminatorCookerNoES extends DelimiterCookerNoES(\"terminator\") to\r\nobject TerminatorCookerNoES extends DelimiterCookerNoSoleES(\"terminator\") in cookers.scala .\r\nI also made thes suggested changes to DelimiterCookerNoSoleEs in EntityReplacer.scala.\r\n2 tests failed, but the error seemed to indicate that DelimiterCookerNoSoleES was called, so I changed the tdml files for those tests and now no tests fail.

The Completer classes don't seem to changed their API much (the class names are still there, only in an impl package), but ConsoleReader has become LineReader in a different package with a somewhat different API for building and using it.  The -Djline.terminal=jline.UnixTerminal and -Djline.terminal=jline.UnsupportedTerminal properties are gone and have no replacements in JLine 3 that I can see.  Also, I saw a comment in a Fedora dev list saying recent Scala needs JLine 3.x (Rawhide has 2.x), JLine 3.x needs jansi 2.x (Rawhide has 1.x), and neither JLine nor jansi are backwards compatible with their previous major version.\r\n\r\nDaffodil's use of the Completer classes should not be had to port, but its use of the ConsoleReader class looks like it will take some effort to port.  No one seems to have written a guide how to migrate applications from JLine 2's ConsoleReader to JLine 3's LineReader (the closest I found so far was <https://groups.google.com/g/jline-users/c/ebQxEFUVkKs>).  Probably the best way would be to compare JLine 2's [Example](https://github.com/jline/jline2/blob/master/src/test/java/jline/example/Example.java) class with JLine 3's [Example](https://github.com/jline/jline3/blob/master/builtins/src/test/java/org/jline/example/Example.java) class and go from there (also make sure you have the source code to look at too).  If possible, can whoever originally wrote the Daffodil code using ConsoleReader port the code?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/806203865/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/807048526","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/481#issuecomment-807048526","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/481","id":807048526,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwNzA0ODUyNg==","user":{"login":"regetom","id":11149210,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTQ5MjEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11149210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/regetom","html_url":"https://github.com/regetom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regetom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regetom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regetom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regetom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regetom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regetom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regetom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regetom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regetom/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-25T16:27:56Z","updated_at":"2021-03-25T16:27:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Yes,

The coverage report makes it clear that the CLI integration tests don't test the JLine code paths.  My own manual testing seemed to work fine (tab completion, etc.) but I don't have much experience with Daffodil's debugger mode and the JLine editing key shortcuts.
