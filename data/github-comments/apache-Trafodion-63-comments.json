However, now the client can't get vc_ind_length from server. The same solution was already in JDBC client. \r\n\r\nIf we want to modify the protocol between client and server to support vc_ind_length, we need modify both JDBC, linux ODBC and windows ODBC.

it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/265648046/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/265656002","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/873#issuecomment-265656002","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/873","id":265656002,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NTY1NjAwMg==","user":{"login":"Traf-Jenkins","id":12548626,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQ4NjI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12548626?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/Traf-Jenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-08T05:25:04Z","updated_at":"2016-12-08T05:25:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Test

is a very specialized solution to the connect by problem and I don't think we should put such a narrowly defined SPJ into Trafodion, where people would expect a more general solution.\r\n\r\nPlease understand that the SPJ shown here is good, it solves a real problem. I just feel that we need to have a more general solution as a built-in function in Trafodion. It would be good if others could comment on that as well.\r\n\r\nHere are some of the limitations I think we should try to avoid:\r\n\r\n- The column structure for recursing is fixed, only a single VARCHAR(100) not null column is supported. Many use cases will need different data types and/or multiple columns.\r\n- The \"root query\" is hard-coded, in many cases a different root query will be required. Example: List all the employees of a manager who is not at the root of the hierarchy.\r\n- As far as I can tell, the SPJ discards all the root nodes except the last.\r\n- The SPJ stores an in-memory table instead of using SQL. This is not scalable and does not use parallelism in the way a user would expect of Trafodion.\r\n- The SPJ does not support a maximum level of recursion, cycle detection, or the ability to record the recursion level or other aggregates.\r\n- There are no comments in the SPJ, making it hard to read.\r\n\r\nWhat about a much more general SPJ that takes the following arguments:\r\n\r\n- The name of a table, partially populated with an initial set of data.\r\n- An SQL query that iterates over this table, computing one level of recursion. The query has an optional input parameter ('%1$s'), which is the level.\r\n- The maximum number of levels to iterate.\r\n- An optional query that executes a test whether iteration is complete. If not specified, iteration stops when the maximum number of levels is reached, an error occurs, or when the iteration inserts no new records.\r\n- An optional SQL query that is executed after the iteration is complete. If not specified, the caller of the SPJ can issue their own query to retrieve the results.\r\n\r\nSuch an SPJ would avoid all the problems I listed above. It could scale to very large data sets and it could use parallelism.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/268329268/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/268329806","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/683#issuecomment-268329806","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/683","id":268329806,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2ODMyOTgwNg==","user":{"login":"zellerh","id":7062636,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNjI2MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7062636?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh","html_url":"https://github.com/zellerh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-20T19:09:56Z","updated_at":"2016-12-20T19:09:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"What about putting this SPJ into the [Trafodion Code Examples](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/TRAFODION/Trafodion+Code+Examples) wiki so people can use and modify it?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/268329806/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/268338983","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/881#issuecomment-268338983","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/881","id":268338983,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2ODMzODk4Mw==","user":{"login":"DaveBirdsall","id":5659628,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk2Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5659628?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveBirdsall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-20T19:43:41Z","updated_at":"2016-12-20T19:43:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I did a little web-surfing and found an example of pthread_mutex_unlock returning EPERM.
