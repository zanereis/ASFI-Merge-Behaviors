Just to re-empahsize, the goal is to enable Zeppelin to submit notebooks to a Kubernetes cluster invoking `spark-submit` in `cluster` deploy mode.\r\n\r\n Please find below a couple of advantages the cluster mode has comparing to the client mode:\r\n\r\n  - currently the cluster client mode appears to have some problems - I faced exactly the same problems what you have  described in the [PR](https://github.com/apache-spark-on-k8s/spark/pull/456) when running multiple interpreters and I’m not sure if\r\n  whether these problems will be resolved and client mode will be supported (I have some PR's on Spark-k8s fork and will catch up with the folks regarding this topic)\r\n  - in cluster mode you are running Zeppelin server and each `RemoteInterpreterServer` process (Spark Driver) is running in **separate** pods which fits better to Kubernetes best practices/patterns (instead of having one monolith RIS)\r\n  - the latest Spark Driver creates a separate K8S Service to handle Executor --> Driver connections in cluster mode, which again fits better in Kubernetes best practices/patterns\r\n  - this solution works regardless of Zeppelin server running in/outside of cluster if we add the option to set up authentication info for Zeppelin\r\n  - it is using `spark-submit` and `interpreter.sh` and simplifies a bit the `spark-submit` command for K8S. Other than this the PR created  `SparkK8RemoteInterpreterManagedProcess` to simplify connection to `RemoteInterpreterServer` in K8S clusters, so we are using K8S client to look up the Driver pod then create a K8S Service bounded to `RemoteInterpreterServer` running inside Driver pod\r\n  - overall this may seem a bit more complicated then client mode however it works better and fits better in Kubernetes cluster best practices/patterns\r\n  - if you have some ideas about a better way to place this functionality in Zeppelin, please let me know \r\n\r\nOverall this is a way better and cleaner approach which fits the K8S ecosystem and at the same time has no side-effect for those not willing to use K8S. \r\n\r\nI will update the PR regardless to fix the merge conflicts and add some minor changes/improvements - I am using this PR extensively on a few large K8S clusters and it works/fits our needs on K8S and complies with the our K8S cluster standards/best practices.

I have tested your last commits and was able to make it work in my env (with both zeppelin `in-` and `out` k8s cluster).\r\n\r\nYour implement a new (specific for spark-k8s) launch and remote executor. In another local branch, I have tried to stick as much as possible to the current zeppelin paradigm (thrift servers both sides of the interpreters processes with CallbackInfo) and 2 parameters (host, port) for interpreter.sh - I still have issue with the callback, so I finally think the approach you propose is good and does the job.\r\n\r\nMy feedbacks:\r\n\r\n+ The branch as-such need basic updates: I had to fix compilation issue with the new classes (`SparkK8sInterpreterLauncher` and `SparkK8sRemoteIntepreterManagedProcess`) and had to add `${ZEPPELIN_SPARK_CONF}` in the `interpreter.sh` script.\r\n+ To find the running driver pod, you actually poll on regular basis. The ideal would be to be notified when the pod is ready (not sure if the k8s client support this. We would closely map the current mechanism of the thrift notification via the CallbackInfo, but here with a pure k8s mechanism. This could be also extended to other interpreters we would want to see in k8s.\r\n+ We need to set `spark.app.name` with must a value starting with `zri-` - If you don't set this in the interpreter settings, the k8s client will not find the driver pod - I wonder if we can make this more configurable, let's say using metada or simply using the InterpreterContext with contains a `properties` attributes with all the given props - the launcher could retrieve this and search for a pod starting with a dynamic prefix rather than with this hardcoded one.\r\n+ The current vanilla zeppelin supports out-of-the-box the spark-k8s `client-mode` (assuming you are using https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2637). The condition to use the `SparkK8sInterpreterLauncher` needs to check for `spark.submit.deployMode` being `cluster` and continue to use the normal ManagedProcess for `client`.\r\n+ On documentation level, certainly mention that the app name must start with `zri-`. Also, relying on the kubespark docker image would be better to ensure nothing special is added in the docker image.\r\n\r\nWDYT?\r\n\r\nDo you prefer me to submit a PR on your PR and will you make another push?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/344504854/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/344505382","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2668#issuecomment-344505382","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2668","id":344505382,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NDUwNTM4Mg==","user":{"login":"zjffdu","id":164491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu","html_url":"https://github.com/zjffdu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-15T07:10:42Z","updated_at":"2017-11-15T07:10:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Leemoonsoo  @jongyoul  @felixcheung @prabhjyotsingh Could you help review it ?

Since so far `\\t` and `\\n` are used as delimiters, there is no way to do that only on the front-end side, because currently there is no way for the frontend to know whether it is a `\\t` or `\\n` in the field or a separator.\r\nIf we want to fix this in the front-end, I think this is a much bigger task which would require a whole refactor of the communication protocol between back-end and frontend (so that we don't have anymore such separator or that there is a way to escape them) and the frontend itself in order to be able to manage those things. If this is the way we choose to go I am fine and I can help with them, but this would probable require a design document and some splitting in subtasks since it is going to be a huge refactor.\r\nWhat do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/344548515/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/344552625","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2664#issuecomment-344552625","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2664","id":344552625,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NDU1MjYyNQ==","user":{"login":"zjffdu","id":164491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu","html_url":"https://github.com/zjffdu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-15T10:35:40Z","updated_at":"2017-11-15T10:35:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mgaido91 Check the comments on https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2992","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/344552625/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/344566979","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2663#issuecomment-344566979","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2663","id":344566979,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NDU2Njk3OQ==","user":{"login":"byamthev","id":26902434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTAyNDM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26902434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/byamthev","html_url":"https://github.com/byamthev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byamthev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byamthev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byamthev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byamthev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byamthev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byamthev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byamthev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byamthev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byamthev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-15T11:36:32Z","updated_at":"2017-11-15T11:36:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I squashed commits, and our CI produced a new successfull build: https://travis-ci.org/nokia/zeppelin/builds/301902386 .\r\nBut it still shows \"Jenkins is validating pull request...\" after reopening the pull request, despite Jenkins build being successfull, this is what I got when I clicked on \"Details\": https://builds.apache.org/job/zeppelin-pull-request/3384/\r\n\r\nBut now that link is gone, it has been replaced with https://builds.apache.org/job/zeppelin-pull-request/\r\nExcept this everything else is fine.
