The old concept of windowing helpers is replaced by windowing policies. There is `Time`, `Count` and `Delta`.  These are translated to `Trigger` and `Evictor` instances using a fixed translation mapping in `PolicyToOperator`.\n\nIf a user wan't the full flexibility they have to specify a `WindowAssigner`. For example, this old API code:\n\n``` java\ninput.window(new MyCustomEvictionPolicy).every(new MyCustomTriggerPolicy)\n```\n\ncan be written with the new API as:\n\n``` java\ninput.window(GlobalWindows.create())\n  .trigger(new MyCustomTrigger)\n  .evictor(new MyCustomEvictor)\n```\n\n(I could add a shortcut to `KeyedDataStream`, so that you can directly do `.window(Evictor, Trigger)` with an implied `GlobalWindows` assigner.)\n\nAlso worth mentioning is that there is no pre-aggregation if an `Evictor` is used.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/143735489/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/143749079","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1181#issuecomment-143749079","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1181","id":143749079,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0Mzc0OTA3OQ==","user":{"login":"mjsax","id":8959638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NTk2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8959638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax","html_url":"https://github.com/mjsax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-28T13:51:53Z","updated_at":"2015-09-28T13:51:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"If

think the example data flow in NiFi is producing data fairly slowly, this is based on the scheduling tab of the GenerateFlowFile processor being set to 2 secs. We could set this to 0 sec to start really going by stopping the processor, right-clicking and selecting Configure. \n\nThe SiteToSiteClientConfig has options to set batch count but the example isn't setting it so it is using some default, and the first instance of the source probably runs and pulls all the available data, and when the second instance runs nothing is left.\n\nIf you set the batch count lower in the example, like this:\n\n```\nSiteToSiteClientConfig clientConfig = new SiteToSiteClient.Builder()\n            .url(\"http://localhost:8080/nifi\")\n            .portName(\"Data for Flink\")\n            .requestBatchCount(5)\n            .buildConfig();\n```\n\nand then have more than 5 flow files queued in NiFi when you start the source topology, I think the other instances will start pulling as well. This seemed to work for me using parallelism of 2, but of course let me know if you are seeing something different.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/144769010/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/144771003","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1206#issuecomment-144771003","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1206","id":144771003,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NDc3MTAwMw==","user":{"login":"mxm","id":837221,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNzIyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/837221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm","html_url":"https://github.com/mxm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-01T15:57:11Z","updated_at":"2015-10-01T15:57:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Good thing I wrote this test :) Should pass now.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/144771003/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/144771060","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1206#issuecomment-144771060","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1206","id":144771060,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NDc3MTA2MA==","user":{"login":"uce","id":1756620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTY2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1756620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce","html_url":"https://github.com/uce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-01T15:57:29Z","updated_at":"2015-10-01T15:57:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Of course only merge if the builds pass.

Same concept on the sending side, it will distribute the data to different nodes in the cluster, sending more data to nodes that are considered less busy. The SiteToSiteClient is what we use internally for two NiFi instances/clusters to communicate with each other. \n\nRegarding how they know they belong to the same system, technically they don't, and other non-Flink clients could pull from that same port, but we have to hope that if an organization is using Flink and NiFi they would be ensuring that port was only being used by this specific Flink streaming process, and there could be multiple output ports to support multiple Flink streaming processes pulling.\n\nThere is also the option to secure a NiFi instance with SSL, and then provide SSL credentials to the SiteToSite client in order lockdown NiFi so that only authorized clients can pull/push data.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/144771981/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/144774614","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1199#issuecomment-144774614","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1199","id":144774614,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NDc3NDYxNA==","user":{"login":"mxm","id":837221,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNzIyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/837221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm","html_url":"https://github.com/mxm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-01T16:11:27Z","updated_at":"2015-10-01T16:11:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Merged
