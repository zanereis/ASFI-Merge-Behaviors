But then, async indexing Fails using `HoodieIndexer` \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12491651/195871992-4df00d23-7c60-4088-88d4-f8dbe4c64869.png)\r\n\r\nSince both `hoodie.metadata.enable=true` and `HoodieIndexer` generate metadata - the problem seems similar. Therefore, cannot really upgrade until and unless these issues are resolved.\r\n\r\n**PS**: currently, the `HoodieIndexer` takes two parameters `--base-path` and `--table-name`. I would imagine `basepath` to be the directory that contains the `table` - but the indexer only works if `base-path` also contains the table name  . e.g.\r\nImagine storage container to be on the path `abfss://abc@a234.dfs.core.windows.net/some/path/to/storage/container` and \r\n a table there `test_table`. \r\nThen, the `base-path` should be `abfss://abc@a234.dfs.core.windows.net/some/path/to/storage/container` and the `table-name` should be `test_table`. \r\nBut what my experience with `HoodieIndexer` is that, the `base-path` must be `abfss://abc@a234.dfs.core.windows.net/some/path/to/storage/container/test_table` and the `tabel-name` to be `test_table`. \r\nThat works but seems bit weird.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1279098063/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1279322054","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/6934#issuecomment-1279322054","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/6934","id":1279322054,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5MQOfG","user":{"login":"hudi-bot","id":79415918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDE1OTE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79415918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/hudi-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-14T18:19:03Z","updated_at":"2022-10-14T18:19:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\nMeta data\n{\n  \"version\" : 1,\n  \"metaDataEntries\" : [ {\n    \"hash\" : \"dc9fe7b043c4c5e49dc86ed585f033af87737e7e\",\n    \"status\" : \"DELETED\",\n    \"url\" : \"https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=12167\",\n    \"triggerID\" : \"dc9fe7b043c4c5e49dc86ed585f033af87737e7e\",\n    \"triggerType\" : \"PUSH\"\n  }, {\n    \"hash\" : \"3baabf3c95bf2091b919e8fee5f98f9199e132c8\",\n    \"status\" : \"SUCCESS\",\n    \"url\" : \"https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=12214\",\n    \"triggerID\" : \"3baabf3c95bf2091b919e8fee5f98f9199e132c8\",\n    \"triggerType\" : \"PUSH\"\n  } ]\n}-->\n## CI report:\n\n* 3baabf3c95bf2091b919e8fee5f98f9199e132c8 Azure: [SUCCESS](https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=12214) \n\n<details>\n<summary>Bot commands</summary>\n  @hudi-bot supports the following commands:\n\n - `@hudi-bot run azure` re-run the last Azure build\n</details>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1279322054/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1279368382","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/6137#issuecomment-1279368382","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/6137","id":1279368382,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5MQZy-","user":{"login":"zhouhaijia","id":1395433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTU0MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1395433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouhaijia","html_url":"https://github.com/zhouhaijia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouhaijia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouhaijia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouhaijia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouhaijia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouhaijia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouhaijia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouhaijia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouhaijia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouhaijia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-14T19:15:11Z","updated_at":"2022-10-14T19:15:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Any updates on this?

@alexeykudinkin this clarifies. can you confirm the avro schemas are coming from the last commit in the timeline ? \r\n\r\nAlso the reason our field changed case over time has been identified. The hive metastore is case insensitive, so when you populate it with upper case, it returns lower case. However when spark reads for the first time a metastore table, it infers the schema from the parquet files and feeds the metastore with properties which are case sensitive. Afterwards, spark reads those properties within the metastore. When properties and hive information diverge (in case of schema evolution) then spark fallback to only read the hive information and leave the properties. This leads to suddenly have lower case columns. Which ultimately breaks hudi has we got in this issue.\r\n\r\nEventuallly, we had to recreate the table from scratch. Now we avoid to feed the properties by making spark read-only access to the metastore.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1279691815/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1279699768","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/3391#issuecomment-1279699768","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3391","id":1279699768,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5MRqs4","user":{"login":"cdmikechen","id":12069428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDY5NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12069428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdmikechen","html_url":"https://github.com/cdmikechen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdmikechen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdmikechen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdmikechen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdmikechen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdmikechen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdmikechen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdmikechen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdmikechen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdmikechen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-15T09:00:39Z","updated_at":"2022-10-15T09:00:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":">
