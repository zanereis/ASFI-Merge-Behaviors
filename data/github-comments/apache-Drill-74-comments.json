I wonder, can we simplify the API a bit. As you stated your change is to change the original `/profiles.json` to:\r\n\r\n```text\r\n/profiles.json\r\n/profiles/running\r\n/profiles/completed\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne could imagine other filters as well: failed requests, completed requests, running requests by Charles, etc.\r\n\r\nSo, I wonder if it makes sense to add the filter as a query option:\r\n\r\n`/profiles/json?status=[all|running|completed]&...`\r\n\r\nWhere the `...` is whatever someone else wants to add later.\r\n\r\nMight make the code a bit simpler also.\r\n\r\nThen, on the unit tests: testing this one might be hard: there is no good way to ensure that there are, in fact, running queries when you request them. If it were me, I'd add a hack to the mock data source. Add a global lock. By default, it is unlocked so existing code works. A test can set the lock, then launch a query in one thread, while testing your API in another. The mock data source, when it fetches a batch, would block if the lock is set, waiting for the lock to be cleared. Ugly, but it should work.\r\n\r\nNow, I'm not sure it's fair for us to ask you to add all that for just this case, so I guess I'm OK with doing only manual ad-hoc tests for now.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/976015866/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/976017727","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2333#issuecomment-976017727","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2333","id":976017727,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAFa5xc46LNk_","user":{"login":"paul-rogers","id":3248881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDg4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3248881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers","html_url":"https://github.com/paul-rogers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-22T23:59:49Z","updated_at":"2021-11-22T23:59:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rymarm & @luocooong sorry, I've been off on other stuff.

The question really is: does the rather limited Drill core team want to support all of them at the same level as the main ones that Just Gotta Work. For huge files. On local, S3, HDFS. With splits. With metadata. With excellent error reporting. And on and on.\r\n\r\nThe PDF thing seems like the prototypical \"not in the core, but a great add-on\" example. Yes, some one user might want to scan zillions of PDF files on an HDFS system. But, the core Drill team can't spend its resources on that when there are still basics to address.\r\n\r\nLet's do this: let's get this into Drill for now. Then:\r\n\r\n* Ensure we have a good way to build plugins separate from the Drill code. (Last time I tried, I couldn't get it to work.)\r\n* Explain how to create a plugin in a users own repo, built against Drill.\r\n* Explain how to drop the plugin into a running Drill to add that functionality.\r\n\r\nThis way, even without a marketplace, folks can build their own connectors separate from the Drill repo.\r\n\r\nA next step might be to split Drill's monorepo into multiple parts, as do many other projects. The current repo would be the core. Then, the contrib stuff could move to its own repo(s) under the Drill project. And, users can create their own extensions in their own repos.

Surely we would want our most experienced contributors to define such a task.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/979755114/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/980850416","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2332#issuecomment-980850416","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2332","id":980850416,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAFa5xc46dpbw","user":{"login":"lgtm-com[bot]","id":43144390,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDMxNDQzOTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/17324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/lgtm-com","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-28T06:55:48Z","updated_at":"2021-11-28T06:55:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This pull request **introduces 1 alert** when merging a011dd80e7319f1fa9f268354c79598ba12da1e3 into 5fb79a17b14c59ef9114e4306bfdbabf315a591b - [view on LGTM.com](https://lgtm.com/projects/g/apache/drill/rev/pr-b950dbe80d606d5b19ec8cdf4e2cbee4823c5f6a)\n\n**new alerts:**\n\n* 1 for Unused format argument","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/980850416/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/981070620","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2387#issuecomment-981070620","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2387","id":981070620,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAFa5xc46efMc","user":{"login":"Z0ltrix","id":14264280,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjY0Mjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14264280?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Z0ltrix","html_url":"https://github.com/Z0ltrix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Z0ltrix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Z0ltrix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Z0ltrix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Z0ltrix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Z0ltrix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Z0ltrix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Z0ltrix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Z0ltrix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Z0ltrix/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-28T11:44:15Z","updated_at":"2021-11-28T11:44:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"compile and normal test works, but TestDrillQueries has problems in compose file.

You've hit on an issue which is subject to a lot of different opinions.  The issue at stake is how do you read data without a schema and what do you do when the data is inconsistent?\r\n\r\nI'm approaching this from the data scientist/user perspective and I am just one data point, but here goes.  I really like the way Pandas handles the whole situation.  Specifically, Pandas does attempt to infer data types, but also gives the user a lot of control over the behavior when things go wrong.   I think Pandas lets the user decide if it throws an exception, ignores it, or coerces a value.  \r\n\r\nI don't know if that's more work than you want to do, but I do feel that logging isn't quite enough because that assumes that a user has logging enabled and can view the logs.  If there was a config option on error handling, it could be changed at query time with the `table()` function.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/990305838/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/990309185","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2394#issuecomment-990309185","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2394","id":990309185,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAFa5xc47ButB","user":{"login":"vvysotskyi","id":20928429,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTI4NDI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20928429?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi","html_url":"https://github.com/vvysotskyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-09T21:50:15Z","updated_at":"2021-12-09T21:50:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@dzamo, please squash commits and specify the Jira ticket number in the commit id.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/990309185/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/990319067","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2400#issuecomment-990319067","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2400","id":990319067,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAFa5xc47BxHb","user":{"login":"cgivre","id":5513150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTMxNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5513150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre","html_url":"https://github.com/cgivre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-09T21:58:43Z","updated_at":"2021-12-09T21:58:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@pjfanning \r\nWhat if we added a boolean config option `nullOnInvalidDate` or something like that, and we could let the user decide what they want?
