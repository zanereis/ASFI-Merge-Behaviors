@dimberman for looking in to this PR.\r\n\r\nAs per current implementation K8 Executor submits/creates one k8 worker pod per scheduler loop. \r\nScheduler creates a single k8 worker pod inside self.executor.heartbeat() function of jobs.py file. In self.executor.heartbeat() function it calls self.sync() which submits/creates single k8 worker pod. \r\ntask_queue might have 100s of tasks to be run but only one task gets submitted per scheduler loop which increases the task scheduling latency/delay.\r\n\r\nEach scheduling loop takes a minimum of 1 second so scheduling latency of last task in the task queue with 1000 tasks will be atleast 1000 seconds.\r\n(We have also observed scheuling loop sometimes taking ~ 2 to 3 seconds which further increases the task latency)\r\n\r\nWe have a use case to run 1000s of concurrent tasks and we started using Airflow with K8 executor where we observed and investigated this behaviour.\r\nSo we are proposing a fix to have some control over the number of worker pods that get submitted per loop. Ideal scenarion might haven been to submit all the tasks  per loop but it can impact the scheduler's processing of DAG files as these are synchronous call. \r\nSo we made this configurable.\r\nPlease let us know if it makes sense and please also share your thoughts/comments","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/454262283/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/454276187","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4507#issuecomment-454276187","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4507","id":454276187,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NDI3NjE4Nw==","user":{"login":"dongli","id":367959,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2Nzk1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/367959?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongli","html_url":"https://github.com/dongli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-15T05:57:51Z","updated_at":"2019-01-15T05:57:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Looking forward this PR!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/454276187/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/454296944","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4531#issuecomment-454296944","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4531","id":454296944,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NDI5Njk0NA==","user":{"login":"bjoernpollex-sc","id":39400648,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDAwNjQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39400648?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjoernpollex-sc","html_url":"https://github.com/bjoernpollex-sc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjoernpollex-sc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjoernpollex-sc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjoernpollex-sc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjoernpollex-sc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjoernpollex-sc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjoernpollex-sc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjoernpollex-sc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjoernpollex-sc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjoernpollex-sc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-15T07:49:27Z","updated_at":"2019-01-15T07:49:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"It feels like creating a plugin to deploy DAGs is an unnecessary extra step.

It already was discussed (I made comment about it) in https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/AIP-7+Simplified+development+workflow and it seems that being able to change the Dockerfiles together with the code you are working on in your fork would be a nice thing. \r\n\r\nThen anyone could setup their own DockerHub + Travis CI account and modify the CI scripts to use their image rather than the apache ones. I would also like to use the same approach (I am already doing it in our fork) to be able to run system tests for GCP using similar approach with Cloud Build (which is much better integrated for GCP system tests) - as described in  https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/AIP-4+Support+for+System+Tests+for+external+systems \r\n\r\nI just finished a big piece of work and over the next couple of days and can make some PR(s) with that to bring modularisation in and to add Travis CI + possibly later Cloud Build images to the 'airflow' repo.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/454394545/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/454394798","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4483#issuecomment-454394798","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4483","id":454394798,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NDM5NDc5OA==","user":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-15T13:39:09Z","updated_at":"2019-01-15T13:39:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Let me know if you think it's a good idea, then I can proceed with it :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/454394798/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/454400526","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4483#issuecomment-454400526","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4483","id":454400526,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NDQwMDUyNg==","user":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-15T13:57:25Z","updated_at":"2019-01-15T13:58:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"One more comment - in our system tests we encountered a lot of troubles with differences of python 3.5 vs. 3.6.

I think there is a bit of confusion with officially supported versions: in tox we have 3.5 and 2.7 but in Google Cloud Composer default python 3 version is 3.6.

You will understand when you look at it why it was a headache and why I needed to test it. There is very, very subtle difference of urlparse behaviour (hostname is not lowercased for some url types) in python 3.6 vs. 3.5 (and s: https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/AIRFLOW/issues/AIRFLOW-3615.
