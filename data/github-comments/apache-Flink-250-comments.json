This could be a separate JIRA actually.\r\n\r\n2) when migrating from an old version, we should ignore potential \"dead-end\" edges (edges that point to nodes that have been removed) in the partial match buffer.

However, the parent MetricGroup retrieved through `Environment#getMetricGroup` is null since this method is never mocked for the `MockEnvironment` in `AbstractStreamOperatorTestHarness`.  Thus, in  `AbstractStreamOperator#setup` we're entering the fail-safe block which creates a dummy `MetricGroup` that never stores anything.\r\nAs such no metric can actually be retrieved from the `MetricGroup`.\r\n\r\nPlease, ask questions if you don't know to fix an issue or verify the fix. And at the very least try it out _once_, otherwise you're just wasting the committers' time.\r\n\r\nFor a proper solution you have to create a `TaskMetricGroup` in the `AbstractStreamOperatorTestHarness`, which you then use in the `MockEnvironment` by returning it from `Environment#getMetricGroup`\r\nWith this scheme however metrics are only available while the task hasn't been closed (as metrics are cleaned up), so for better usability your `TaskMetricGroup` must override `TaskMetricGroup#getOperator` to return a special `OperatorMetricGroup` that also stores registered metrics in the `AbstractStreamOperatorTestHarness`. We do not store them indefinitely in the `OperatorMetricGroup` since that would change one of the core behaviors of the `MetricGroup`. Finally, add a `getMetrics` method to the `AbstractStreamOperatorTestHarness` to actually access registered metrics.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/394303222/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/394303920","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6108#issuecomment-394303920","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6108","id":394303920,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NDMwMzkyMA==","user":{"login":"kl0u","id":2405800,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDU4MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2405800?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u","html_url":"https://github.com/kl0u","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-04T10:11:47Z","updated_at":"2018-06-04T10:11:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the useful input here @zhangxinyu1 and @StephanEwen.
