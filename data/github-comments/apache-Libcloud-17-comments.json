think having some kind of retry mechanism in Libcloud is reasonable, but I haven't had the time to look at the implementation yet.\n\nIn the past, we were against that and allowed users to built their own retry mechanism on top, but this was a less of an issue back in the past where 1 method call usually mapped to a single API call, but these days, a lot of methods result into multiple API calls.\n\nIn general, it should probably also be opt-in to start with (or maybe start with retry only for \"GET\" requests) since some operations are not idempotent and may return an error but still complete which could potentially result in additional resource being created.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/105669713/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/105669867","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/515#issuecomment-105669867","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/515","id":105669867,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwNTY2OTg2Nw==","user":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-26T21:28:32Z","updated_at":"2015-05-26T21:28:32Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"As

libcloud runs on the following python version:\nPython 2.7.6 (default, Mar 22 2014, 22:59:56)\n[GCC 4.8.2] on linux2\n\nin an ubuntu 14.04 system. My devstack is from a latest version.\n\nI am using the following snippet to run openstack operations which fail, as described in the above jira issue link.\n\n```\nfrom libcloud.compute.types import Provider\nfrom libcloud.compute.providers import get_driver\nOpenStack = get_driver(Provider.OPENSTACK)\ndriver = OpenStack('demo', '******',\n                   ex_tenant_name='demo',\n                   ex_force_auth_url='http://1.2.3.4:5000',\n                   ex_force_auth_version='2.0_password')\nprint driver.list_sizes()\n```\n\nMy python2.7 socket.py create_connection complains that port is not an int or str. Looking into this, I can see that it receives a port from unicode type and that is probably the reason it fails. \n\nAdding traces in _tuple_from_url to print netloc and its type, I can see that netloc for the nova service is unicode.\n\n1.2.3.4:5000, <type 'str'>\n1.2.3.4:5000, <type 'str'>\n1.2.3.4:8774, <type 'unicode'>\n\nFrom looking into libcloud code it seems to me that port can be a string if it is fetched out from a url (_tuple_from_url).\nIt seems that libcloud -> openstack communication is done through urls: connecting into keystone first (passing keystone url through ex_force_auth_url) followed by connecting into the proper openstack service API (e.g. nova) which is retrieved from the catalog returned by the keystone service, which is a url as well. The later is parsed as a unicode which leads to a unicode port which again, probably leads to my socket.py failure.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nI would like to raise a question: \nLooking into _tuple_from_url, I can see:\n\n```\n         if \":\" in netloc:\n             netloc, port = netloc.rsplit(\":\")\n             port = port\n```\n\nI am curious whether the 2nd port assignment is somewhat redundant. \nPerhaps port can be consistent and be set as an integer here, as I can see in _tuple_from_url that port can be set with integers of 80 or 443 (if not set before).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/109256532/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/109256754","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/533#issuecomment-109256754","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/533","id":109256754,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwOTI1Njc1NA==","user":{"login":"aviweit","id":11485357,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDg1MzU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11485357?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aviweit","html_url":"https://github.com/aviweit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aviweit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aviweit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aviweit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aviweit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aviweit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aviweit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aviweit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aviweit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aviweit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-05T10:46:32Z","updated_at":"2015-06-05T10:46:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This

The documentation states this:\n\n```\n\n    Serialize an element to an encoded string representation of its XML\n    tree.\n    Defaults to ASCII encoding without XML declaration.  This\n    behaviour can be configured with the keyword arguments 'encoding'\n    (string) and 'xml_declaration' (bool).  Note that changing the\n    encoding to a non UTF-8 compatible encoding will enable a\n    declaration by default.\n```\n\nAnd the code is this:\n\n```\n    elif xml_declaration is None:\n        # by default, write an XML declaration only for non-standard encodings\n        write_declaration = encoding is not None and encoding.upper() not in \\\n                            (u'ASCII', u'UTF-8', u'UTF8', u'US-ASCII')\n```\n\nI'm not familiar enough with lxml to see what goes wrong, but it should not write a XML declaration for `encoding='utf8'`\n\nI will open a bug report on the lxml tracker, just in case.\n\nUpdate: here is the report

I did a bit of testing, and you could do something like this instead of the proposed change:\n\n``` python\nstart_time = datetime.datetime.now()\nprint \"=> Compute demo/test start time: %s' % str(start_time)\ngce = get_driver(Provider.GCE)('','', project='graphite-demos', auth_type='GCE')\nprint \"=> default timeout:\", gce.connection.timeout\ngce.connection.timeout = 4\nprint \"=> new timeout:\", gce.connection.timeout\n# Get project info and print name\nproject = gce.ex_get_project()\nprint \"=> Project: %s' % project.name\nnode = gce.create_node(\"foo\", \"n1-standard-1\", \"debian-7\", \"us-central1-f\")\n```\n\nAnd when I execute my demo script, I see that the timeout was honored.\n\n``` sh\n=> Compute demo/test start time: 2015-07-14 16:06:10.399974\n=> default timeout: 180\n=> new timeout: 4\n=> Project: graphite-demos\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"d.py\", line 640, in <module>\n    main_compute()\n  File \"d.py\", line 233, in

`connection` object's `timeout` parameter the way I did in the example.\n\n@Kami - any other comments / tips /

If that's not possible, an alternative would be to add a flag (`proxy_raw_requests_use_full_url` or whatever) which user can use to toggle this mode on.
