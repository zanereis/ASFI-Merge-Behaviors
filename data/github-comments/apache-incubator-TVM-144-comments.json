The idea is to put the shared code among AlterOpLayout and ConvertLayout pass in transform_layout.h.\r\n* Both AlterOpLayout and ConvertLayout use FForwardRewrite. FForwardRewrite accepts a context.

I didn't verify all the patches, but the change leading to my concern is among these below.\r\n\r\n```\r\n9e4f07b4695a8849590cdd46de662e3fa273d59b Enable miopen transpose convolution and fp16 support (#3952)\r\n0482623e9c20518fac8e6ceb34a6552f674fed9b [Relay][TensorFlow] Add support for SquaredDifference (#3930)\r\nda039794cfc7c7d94855b0dc6f93248f13222c7f [AutoTVM] Enhance tuning space of split (#3949)\r\ne35e1cc2e8d6b14aae5c888b12205b85afc80bb2 trivial (#3954)\r\n4b431c67fdc55062afa682fe3d4816bd02b9f7ec 1) Add EQ op to the deduce_bound and add unittests for the same (#3775)\r\n2536465c2e274273344c5e67337fd3b4c252ec2f Vulkan2 Runtime API (#3849)\r\n06aecc60ea55e10cc029ec4c2f3ff2fcc811c802 [VTA] RPC path update.

The reason I made this change is that we are trying to apply a schedule config from one shape to another. For example, assuming we have a config `['tile_x', 'sp', [4, 8]]` from a shape with length 32, and we wish to apply it to another shape with length 16. In this case, `['tile_x', 'sp', [4, 8]]` is inapplicable, but `['tile_x', 'sp', [-1, 8]]` is fine, as it implies `['tile_x', 'sp', [2, 8]]`.\r\n\r\nSorry if this change breaks your schedule.

I would consider move the json runtime to\r\n> `apps/extern_runtime` to allow us to write examples even in python. It would be great to see examples like:\r\n> \r\n\r\n> ```python\r\n> mod = DSOModule()\r\n> mod.import_module(JSONExampleModule())\r\n> \r\n> mod.export_library(\"xyz.so\")\r\n> \r\n> mod = tvm.module.load(\"xyz.so\")\r\n> # run that he code that can uses functions in the JSONExampleModule\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> The main goal is to provide readers an easy reference point about how to add their own runtimes.\r\n\r\nIsn't it also to provide a standardized structure for them to integrate their runtimes ? Are we expecting such integrations to happen via the 3rd party directory mechanism which is currently really for build dependencies. Giving an example integration shows how it can be done, providing with an initial location and standard mechanism for the simple toy integration. \r\n\r\nIn my opinion a simple integration should provide a template to follow. Putting this in examples appears to suggest that folks can do what they want with the 3rd party runtime integration.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> As a followup, we can add docs/dev/custom_codegen_runtime.rst that introduces both the compile to DSOModule method and the extern json runtime example, with reference to the folder.\r\n\r\nI'm puzzled by this direction. \r\n\r\nWhat is missing for me in this pull request is actually a directory structure or something that indicates where and how custom run times can go in. This suggests that we could have a full custom run time sitting in the app / examples folder  ?

The reason the evaluation of these scripts failed previously is that \r\n\r\n> This PR fixed an issue in the streamlined GEMM execution by disabling pipelined adder, which consumes 4 cycles (in case of LOG_BLOCK=4) in addition to the single-cycle fused multiplier-adder. This is much longer than the 4-stage streamline design in the TensorGemm module.\r\n\r\nHere are the benchmarks from Intel's Timing Analyzer (, with **cycle count** and **result** entry performed with `matrix_multiply_opt.py` script).\r\n\r\n| design | area (in ALMs) | fmax (slow 100C) | fmax (slow -40C) | fmax (fast 100C) | fmax (fast -40C) | cycle count | result |\r\n| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --

I'm glad the performance is on par on a small kernel. Do you mind checking tuned performance for e2e resnet18 and/or mobilenet? One thing to keep track of is the schedule space. If the schedule space for your implementation turns out to be very large, it might make tuning quite expensive. One thing to get around this is to use xgboost tuner, and limit the number of trials to something like 1000.
