I definitely want to get this right. So when initially researched permissions in regard to adding the View/Download icons, I discovered that when I removed the 'View the Data' policy from a users accesses, the List Queue option in the canvas context menu actually provides an \"Insufficient Permission\" dialog when a user attempts to execute that function. Naturally, I assumed that meant an end user could never get to the List Queue dialog if they lacked appropriate accesses and subsequently never get to the Download/View buttons displayed under the \"showDetails()\" method within \"nf-queue-listing.js\". [1]\r\n\r\n[1]\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/94c2b1e76ebab33b6417fb46ce046e59c51fcdca/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-framework-bundle/nifi-framework/nifi-web/nifi-web-ui/src/main/webapp/js/nf/canvas/nf-queue-listing.js#L543\r\n\r\n\r\nI do see the showDetails() method has the additional API call that returns a response with the \"contentClaimContainer\" property populated for the requested flow file, unless of course the file actually has no content associated with it (i.e. - 0 bytes), in which case it was not present. I do also see where this property is evaluated to hide/show the view/download buttons [2].\r\n\r\n[2]\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/94c2b1e76ebab33b6417fb46ce046e59c51fcdca/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-framework-bundle/nifi-framework/nifi-web/nifi-web-ui/src/main/webapp/js/nf/canvas/nf-queue-listing.js#L598\r\n\r\nSo, I guess I am a little unclear how this is related to the provenance functionality you referenced? Are you indicating the that the \"contentClaimContainer\" property is additionally acting as a permissions based value that hide/showing those buttons when an end user is not authorized to see the content on \"nf-queue-listing.js\"?

Previously I had a simple dialog popup indicating that the flowfile was empty and could not perform the function but after @patricker recommended that a simple disabled is sufficient, that dialog was removed. Is there a preference as to how you think it should be presented? My thanks again for all the great feedback.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/485498533/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/485532409","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3448#issuecomment-485532409","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3448","id":485532409,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NTUzMjQwOQ==","user":{"login":"bbende","id":605416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTQxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende","html_url":"https://github.com/bbende","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-22T19:59:43Z","updated_at":"2019-04-22T19:59:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Is there any reason that the context is being constructed manually, rather than calling  `sslContextService.createSSLContext(clientAuth)` ?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/485532409/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/485563641","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3414#issuecomment-485563641","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3414","id":485563641,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NTU2MzY0MQ==","user":{"login":"ottobackwards","id":1111551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTE1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards","html_url":"https://github.com/ottobackwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-22T21:45:31Z","updated_at":"2019-04-22T21:45:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@arenger I have upgraded simple-syslog5424 to antlr 4.7.2.

On which branch did you make the updates to simple-syslog5424?  I could pull those into a new branch that adds a new `FilterJson` processor backed by `JsonSurfer`.

Generating an id for the producer in ```PublisherLease``` might be better.\r\n\r\nThe trivial solution would be to add ```@TriggerSerially``` but I think this is not we want due to performance reasons.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/489528652/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/489614943","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3458#issuecomment-489614943","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3458","id":489614943,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4OTYxNDk0Mw==","user":{"login":"mcgilman","id":123395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzM5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman","html_url":"https://github.com/mcgilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-06T13:12:07Z","updated_at":"2019-05-06T13:12:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Will review...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/489614943/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/489658066","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3458#issuecomment-489658066","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3458","id":489658066,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4OTY1ODA2Ng==","user":{"login":"mcgilman","id":123395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzM5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman","html_url":"https://github.com/mcgilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-06T15:14:20Z","updated_at":"2019-05-06T15:14:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rfellows Thanks for the PR.
