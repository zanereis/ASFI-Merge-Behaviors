I think you are confusing our internal code with open source code.  We have been using an early patch of kafka with security, that supported security on the older kafka consumer API, and added a corresponding patch to the kafka-spout to support it.  When security finally was officially merged into kafka only the new consumer API was supported, and it can be configured completely through the properties/the broker URI.\n\nhttp://docs.confluent.io/2.0.0/kafka/ssl.html#configuring-kafka-clients\n\nas such `securityProtocol` is not needed any more, and was actually never in open
