To put it differently - the events of the first 5 min of the hour will be indexed 12 times until the full 1 hour segment is finalized. \r\nIf that is indeed the case, maybe there is an advantage to changing the segmentGranularity instead, it will put less load on the KIS tasks. \r\nIf having multiple granularities is not recommended, I can update the script we use for merging segments so that it will only merge on hour boundary.\r\n\r\nThank

Would you mind writing one up to help reviewers understand what your patch is doing?\r\n\r\nI don't know what the final template will be, so feel free to make up your own template for now. Or if you want a suggested template, try this one:\r\n\r\n> 1) Motivation: Describe the problem and why you want to solve it.\r\n> 2) Proposed changes: Describe your solution to the problem. This may be fairly extensive or it may just be a sentence or two, depending on the scope of the change. This should include any changes that are proposed to user-facing interfaces (configuration parameters, JSON query/ingest specs, SQL language, emitted metrics, and so on).\r\n> 3) Rationale: Discuss why your proposed solution is the best one. The goal of this section is to help people understand why this is the best solution now, and also to prevent churn in the future when old alternatives are reconsidered. This should include any alternative solutions that you considered and decided against.\r\n> 4) Operational impact: Is anything going to be deprecated or removed by this change? Is there a migration path that cluster operators need to be aware of? Will there be any effect on the ability to do a rolling upgrade, or to do a rolling _downgrade_ if an operator wants to switch back to a previous version?\r\n> 5) Future work: A discussion of things that you believe are out of scope for the particular proposal but would be nice follow-ups. It helps show where a particular change could be leading us. There isn't any commitment that you will actually work on this stuff, and it's okay if this section is empty.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/459538914/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/459540714","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/4137#issuecomment-459540714","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4137","id":459540714,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1OTU0MDcxNA==","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-31T23:03:52Z","updated_at":"2019-01-31T23:03:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think this is fixed in #5868 and #5869.

So now segments are correctly stored in Swift, however when Historical is trying to get it back from Deep storage it fails.\r\n\r\nI think the issue is\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/pull/5382#discussion_r175912273\r\nThis is exactly what is happening in my case. Where result.getKeyCount() is 0 but result.getObjectSummaries() have size > 0.\r\n\r\nWhen it is doing ListObjectsV2Request, i tried to debug the code and the response actually has object summary but KeyCount is Zero. Which is causing it to fail.\r\nI tried to debug the code of unmarshalling of List object result, and it seems the Unmarshaller expects the response to have a element called as KeyCount then only it sets it in the result object, otherwise it stays zero.\r\n\r\nThis is the actual log I get:\r\n2019-02-02T15:04:19,789 ERROR [ZkCoordinator] org.apache.druid.segment.loading.SegmentLoaderLocalCacheManager - Failed to load segment in current location /data/projects/imply-2.8.9/var/druid/segment-cache, try next location if any: {class=org.apache.druid.segment.loading.SegmentLoaderLocalCacheManager, exceptionType=class org.apache.druid.segment.loading.SegmentLoadingException, exceptionMessage=Cannot find object for bucket[test4] and key[druid/segments/Consumer_Complaints/2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z_2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z/2019-02-02T15:03:18.693Z/0/index.zip], location=/data/projects/imply-2.8.9/var/druid/segment-cache}\r\norg.apache.druid.segment.loading.SegmentLoadingException: Cannot find object for bucket[test4] and key[druid/segments/Consumer_Complaints/2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z_2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z/2019-02-02T15:03:18.693Z/0/index.zip]\r\n\tat org.apache.druid.storage.s3.S3DataSegmentPuller.getSegmentFiles(S3DataSegmentPuller.java:139) ~[?:?]\r\n\tat org.apache.druid.storage.s3.S3LoadSpec.loadSegment(S3LoadSpec.java:60) ~[?:?]\r\n\tat org.apache.druid.segment.loading.SegmentLoaderLocalCacheManager.loadInLocation(SegmentLoaderLocalCacheManager.java:200) ~[druid-server-0.13.0-incubating-iap6-SNAPSHOT.jar:0.13.0-incubating-iap6-SNAPSHOT]\r\n\tat org.apache.druid.segment.loading.SegmentLoaderLocalCacheManager.loadInLocationWithStartMarker(SegmentLoaderLocalCacheManager.java:188) ~[druid-server-0.13.0-incubating-iap6-SNAPSHOT.jar:0.13.0-incubating-iap6-SNAPSHOT]\r\n\tat org.apache.druid.segment.loading.SegmentLoaderLocalCacheManager.loadSegmentWithRetry(SegmentLoaderLocalCacheManager.java:151) [\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/460006580/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/460021365","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/6993#issuecomment-460021365","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6993","id":460021365,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MDAyMTM2NQ==","user":{"login":"peferron","id":7009852,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMDk4NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7009852?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peferron","html_url":"https://github.com/peferron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peferron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peferron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peferron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peferron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peferron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peferron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peferron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peferron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peferron/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-03T04:07:12Z","updated_at":"2019-02-03T04:07:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I really like this proposal!\r\n\r\nFor context: we plan to make large interactive queries more responsive by running many low-priority background queries in order to populate a remote cache such as Redis or Memcached.

Periodically the Avro files should end up there. This is to verify if Divolte is happy and able to write the Avro messages. It might be that the config isn't picked up for some reason. Then you can also inspect the data using `avro-tools`.\r\n- Secondly, I noticed that you set the format of the timestamp to `iso`. Divolte provides a long timestamp by default.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't be surprised that there would be an encoding issue. I don't see any places where we do encoding of the messages. If you have some of the base64 encoded messages, I can start writing a unit
