This issue is caused by cuda jit. I checked default configuration of Makefile, the gen_code option for nvcc doesn't contain CUDA compute 61 arch so every kernel is converted to compute 61 in runtime because my gpu arch is 61. As mentioned in https://groups.google.com/d/msg/arrayfire-users/D3RORyrvn4s/N7AoKueSCAAJ, the conversion takes in the order of minutes, which matches my observation. It works well after adding sm_61 to gen_code option.\r\n\r\n@piiswrong cmake handles different cuda archs correctly. (https://github.com/dmlc/mshadow/blob/master/cmake/Cuda.cmake) Do you think it's good idea to port that part to Makefile? I don't know how does pip release handle this problem, but as c++ users need to compile by themselves, it makes life easier to check gpu archs automatically.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/302477206/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/302487833","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/6312#issuecomment-302487833","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/6312","id":302487833,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMjQ4NzgzMw==","user":{"login":"yijiezh","id":10201332,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjAxMzMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10201332?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yijiezh","html_url":"https://github.com/yijiezh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yijiezh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yijiezh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yijiezh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yijiezh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yijiezh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yijiezh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yijiezh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yijiezh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yijiezh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-18T17:45:33Z","updated_at":"2017-05-18T17:45:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"If
