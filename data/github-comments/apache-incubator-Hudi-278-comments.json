At the time when I initially started developing these jobs (a long time back with the previous version of hudi connector - 0.5.x), I wasn't aware of the fact that s3 has strong consistency. I assumed it was eventual consistency. I can change the hudi config value to `'hoodie.consistency.check.enabled': 'false'` and test. But do you assume it might have a connection to this error ? I assume with `'hoodie.consistency.check.enabled': 'true'`, hudi would try to make sure that all files are available - as an extra check ? \r\nI have raised a support ticket with AWS.
