https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api/v1/objects/copy:\r\n\r\n>Use the copy method to copy between objects in the same location and storage class. When copying objects across locations or storage classes it's sometimes possible to use the copy method, but we recommend using the rewrite method instead because if the source and destination are in different locations or storage classes the copy method calls the rewrite method exactly once behind the scenes. The larger the object the more likely that multiple rewrite calls will be needed to complete the operation. If the single rewrite call made by copy doesn't complete the operation it will result in a Deadline exceeded error.\r\n\r\nI am curious to know the use of `copy` method in presence of `rewrite`

In this case, a small change to my PR would allow us to propagate job-specific failure messages into the Airflow task logs, which I think would be useful (the original PR already does this, but only when the top-level error field is not filled).

But for the python operator part, I feel opening another PR making changes to provide Airflow context in hive is missing some context and thus belongs to this PR more--updating the env var mapping is quite safe and I don't this worth losing the context to create another PR for it.\r\n\r\nAlso, would you elaborate a bit more on what checks do you have in mind please?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/395994839/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/395995423","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3432#issuecomment-395995423","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3432","id":395995423,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NTk5NTQyMw==","user":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-09T20:10:11Z","updated_at":"2018-06-09T20:10:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hopefully the PR https://github.com/dropbox/PyHive/pull/219 will be merged quickly and there will be a new release.

Currently the tests are failing because master is broken though (test_check_operators was broken a few commits ago it seems). In the meantime, I think this is ready. I would love if you guys can try it out.\r\n\r\nI'm concerned about documentation. A few days ago, Fokko introduced a little bit of documentation for [setting up a development environment using docker](https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/commit/7db18183677d96e37f4671aa846815d3ecc7e58c). It only adds a section to use a docker container for dev mode, but it doesn't address the rest of the contributor's documentation, e.g:\r\n\r\n* `./run_unit_tests.sh` is completely unusable\r\n*  There are lots of integration tests in the test suite, which need a more comprehensive setup (MySQL, krb5 tests) than just a single docker container with python\r\n* And of course, calling these \"unit tests\" is simply not accurate. These are integration tests as far as I can tell\r\n\r\nFor now, I decided to document [3 ways of setting up a dev environment](https://github.com/gerardo/incubator-airflow/blob/dd7a33ae4493b10332e76c85e000ea23274d89c8/CONTRIBUTING.md#development-and-testing). I think it might be better to just use this PR to address the CI environment, and create a separate one to document a development workflow properly.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/396094216/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/396111560","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3485#issuecomment-396111560","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3485","id":396111560,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NjExMTU2MA==","user":{"login":"imroc","id":7448852,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NDg4NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7448852?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imroc","html_url":"https://github.com/imroc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imroc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imroc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imroc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imroc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imroc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imroc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imroc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imroc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imroc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-11T03:16:02Z","updated_at":"2018-06-11T03:16:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@yrqls21  you're all right, the default value of autocommit should be False, my bad, I changed it back to False in this [PR](https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/3487)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/396111560/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/396111719","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3487#issuecomment-396111719","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3487","id":396111719,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NjExMTcxOQ==","user":{"login":"imroc","id":7448852,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NDg4NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7448852?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imroc","html_url":"https://github.com/imroc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imroc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imroc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imroc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imroc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imroc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imroc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imroc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imroc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imroc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-11T03:17:19Z","updated_at":"2018-06-11T03:18:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Fokko @yrqls21   PTAL.

This will be of the form \"Job step foo (jobId) failed\". This replaces the current message \"Job failed, see this log file gs:/...\". User can always fetch the workflow (via gcloud command) to see all errors; and also fetch the job by id which is now captured in the message.\r\n\r\nI feel strongly that Airflow should not _rewrite_ Dataproc error messages as this can only lead to confusion.
