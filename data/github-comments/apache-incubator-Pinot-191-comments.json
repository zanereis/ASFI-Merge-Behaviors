Even if the kafka topic is partitioned by the same user_id, there is not guarantee that all users will be part of same segment.\r\n> \r\n> I shared above a work in progress branch with more funnel count aggregation strategies, effectively equivalents to DISTINCTCOUNT, DISTINCTCOUNTBITMAP and DISTINCTCOUNTTHETASKETCH. These do not depend on partitioning.\r\n> \r\n> The strategy equivalent to SEGMENTPARTITIONEDDISTINCTCOUNT we have here is just a first version. When the column is configured as partition column we only have the same users across time boundaries between segments, which when grouping over time (eg per hour) to see funnel trends, gives good enough approximations. In the future it should be possible to incorporate a partition level (or server level?) phase so that we aggregate differently between segments within the same partition and segments across partitions. I will need more time for that though, for now I am adding different strategies so we can use the right one for each use case, as it will also depend on the sessionization window desired.\r\n\r\nHopefully these aggregation strategies address the concerns here?\r\n\r\nRegarding the other concern about sub-function arguments not being real transform functions, that will be addressed in a separate PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1632555378/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1632644587","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/10960#issuecomment-1632644587","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/10960","id":1632644587,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5hUC3r","user":{"login":"geekboood","id":23272969,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjcyOTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23272969?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geekboood","html_url":"https://github.com/geekboood","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geekboood/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geekboood/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geekboood/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geekboood/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geekboood/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geekboood/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geekboood/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geekboood/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geekboood/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-12T14:34:32Z","updated_at":"2023-07-12T14:35:10Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> When configuring xmx16G, java will use up to 16G heap and up to 16G direct memory, mapped memory is not tracked though.

Ex. `myTable` is a realtime upsert table with 8 kafka partitions.  Later, data volume has grown such that I really ought to be using 16 partitions to handle the volume.  Using this feature, I could go about adding `myTable_v2` which is populated from a new kafka topic with 16 partitions this time.  Then I could \"flip the switch\" so that queries would start using the new table instead of the original table.  There are similar parallels for OFFLINE tables as well, where I might want to rebuild the table in some backward incompatible or potentially dangerous way, and maintain the ability to swap to the new table immediately, and also swap back immediately if things don't go according to plan.\r\n\r\nIf this can be extended or re-used to be able to support what Jackie mentioned, i.e. \"fanout\" queries to all tables with the same alias, that would be great too.  I can think of many use cases where it would be helpful to have multiple tables sharing an alias.\r\n\r\nIf fanning out to multiple tables can be done via alias though, it feels like `UNION` might be even better to support?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1633182873/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
