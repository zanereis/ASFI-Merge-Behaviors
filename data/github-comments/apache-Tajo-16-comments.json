I think that this patch is ready for review.\n\nTo address @hyunsik's comment, I added a class called `FunctionInvoke`. This class describes how the functions are executed.\n\nOn executing Python scripts, I used the approach of using an external UDF controller that is responsible for executing python scripts as commented above. When a submitted query involves one or more python UDFs, several UDF controllers are executed to compute UDFs. Input/output tuples are transmitted via stdio. This approach may have an issue on performance, but I think it is inevitable without using Jython.\n\nCurrently, the controller is executed for each Python functions. That is, if a query involves 5 Python functions even some of them are same, at least 5 different controllers are executed during query processing. I chose this architecture due to its simplicity. \n\nHere are some highlights of changes.\n- `AnyDatum` is used to support Python's dynamic typing. \n- `PythonScriptEngine` is responsible for maintaining the external controller process. To reduce overhead, the controller should be forked only when UDFs are actually evaluated. In this patch, there are three points where the controller is forked.\n  - Constant folding optimization in Tajo master: During constant folding, some UDFs can be evaluated. If necessary, controllers are forked and immediately destroyed after evaluation.\n  - Non-from query execution in Tajo master. If the query involves Python UDFs, controllers are forked during query processing.\n  - Task execution in worker: If the plan of a stage involves Python UDFs, controllers are forked (destroyed) when a task starts up (shuts down). Due to the simplicity, I chose this architecture rather than sharing controllers among multiple tasks via `ExecutionBlockSharedResource`.\n- Refactoring the `EvalNode::bind()` function. This function now receives `EvalContext` in addition to `Schema`. `EvalContext` can contain some information given at runtime such as `ScriptEngine` started by each task.\n\nFor reviewers, I apologize for a large patch. But many changes are related to just refactoring of the bind() function and renaming some functions. \nThanks.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/91983935/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/92003200","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/430#issuecomment-92003200","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/430","id":92003200,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDkyMDAzMjAw","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-12T07:29:26Z","updated_at":"2015-04-12T07:29:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1\nThanks @navis.

Client Side Var is not working with ResultSet now.\n   Because, getCliSideVar() and getClientSideSessionVars() see different vairable map;\n2. in \"SET TIME ZONE 'GMT+1' case\n   It is parsed and executed in Server Side. but in tajo, There is no ability to set client side var from server.\n   so, currently, SET TIME ZONE commands just set TIMEZONE into Server Side Variable.\n\nThat's why I just change TIMEZONE as Server Side Var. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/92056624/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/92057398","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/503#issuecomment-92057398","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/503","id":92057398,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDkyMDU3Mzk4","user":{"login":"charsyam","id":439301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTMwMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/charsyam","html_url":"https://github.com/charsyam","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charsyam/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charsyam/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charsyam/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charsyam/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charsyam/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charsyam/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charsyam/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charsyam/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charsyam/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-12T13:06:20Z","updated_at":"2015-04-12T13:06:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@blrunner I updated testcases and code :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/92057398/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/92067696","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/453#issuecomment-92067696","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/453","id":92067696,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDkyMDY3Njk2","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-12T14:07:25Z","updated_at":"2015-04-12T14:07:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @blrunner.\nWith my laptop, `mvn clean install -Pparallel-test -DLOG_LEVEL=WARN -Dmaven.fork.count=2` is failed due to missing licences while testing on `Tajo Catalog Drivers`.
