Maybe we can judge via SPI to know XA transaction manager is existed.\r\n\r\n**yes, I'll refactor it like that.**\r\n\r\n> To be discuss:\r\n> \r\n> 1. Create XA data source will need 2 times for database connection, because we need to keep 2 types of data source map, any resolution to avoid it? If we use XA data source, but don't open XA transaction, is it possible work fine just like regular data source?\r\n\r\n**I have listed the task in `add switch controls within transaction type changes`, i'll resolve these issues later.**\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/434619445/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/434631278","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/1404#issuecomment-434631278","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/1404","id":434631278,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNDYzMTI3OA==","user":{"login":"terrymanu","id":5516298,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTYyOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5516298?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu","html_url":"https://github.com/terrymanu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-31T10:10:57Z","updated_at":"2018-10-31T10:10:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"**For
