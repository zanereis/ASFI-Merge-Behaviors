like there are some pep8 violations in the test fixtures that should be cleaned up at some point.  The way we have tox tests set up, they're not being surfaced, but when I applied the patch, I saw this output:\n\n``` sh\nApplying: Added support for HTTP(S) proxies with BackendServices.

Apologies for the delay getting back to you.\n\nI'm a little confused on the process you are running with the apache repo's and github repo as a clone. So will try and explain what I did and why.\n\nMy understanding is as follows, please correct me if I am incorrect.\n\nOriginally you was unable to merge in this change due to my repo being in a mess.\n\nI removed my messy repo, forked from the latest version at the time and re-applied my fixes, which as far as i can see are these two files. libcloud/common/azure.py libcloud/common/base.py, nothing else.\n\nThere is about 10 lines of changes in here total, some of which is Autopep8 to clean up.\n\nPlease can you clarify what you are seeing (maybe provide a diff) and I can review it.\n\nThank you for your assistance working through these issues,\nLuke\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/257260220/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/257267939","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/930#issuecomment-257267939","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/930","id":257267939,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NzI2NzkzOQ==","user":{"login":"pquentin","id":42327,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMzI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42327?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pquentin","html_url":"https://github.com/pquentin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pquentin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pquentin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pquentin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pquentin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pquentin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pquentin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pquentin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pquentin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pquentin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-31T11:11:23Z","updated_at":"2016-10-31T11:11:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tonybaloney

In view of support and maintainability, I think it's better to have version control.\n\nThe ideas behind this is\n- if no api version is specified, then the latest version is used. This will imply breaking changes if it occurs. But use will benefit from the latest release\n- Having specify a version, consistency is assured with no changes required until the version is out dated and no longer supported. \n- We will avoid breaking changes as much as we can. \n\nAn example of use of this version control for backward compatibility \nhttps://github.com/samuelchong/libcloud/commit/9cb7785e1707b7c688820a7a7a6a8a1df9c19597\n\nSome other benefit:\n-    oldest_api_version = 2.2\n-    latest_api_version = 2.4\n-    active_api_version = 2.3\n  - Deprecate a version when it is outdated, or give warning for a period of time warning user to upgrade before it fall out of support.\n  - Avoid complex logic to support X number of versions which will get messy when more versions are being released.\n  - Allow testing of beta version by using latest_api_version\n  - Default version (stable version) is set to active_api_version unless user specify one\n\nFurther feedback and comment welcome. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/259848237/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/259857013","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/940#issuecomment-259857013","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/940","id":259857013,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1OTg1NzAxMw==","user":{"login":"tonybaloney","id":1532417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzI0MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1532417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney","html_url":"https://github.com/tonybaloney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-11T01:24:22Z","updated_at":"2016-11-11T01:24:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"ah i see, yes if you're also planning on building logic into the driver around the models and behaviours of the API.\nthe `distutils` package has a `LooseVersion` class which has a `__cmp__` method for comparing values, this would be cleaner than using the `float(` converter all over the place\n\nhttp://epydoc.sourceforge.net/stdlib/distutils.version.LooseVersion-class.html\n\nI don't know if it's supported in 2.6, but work checking.
