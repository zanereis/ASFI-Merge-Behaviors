(In K8S, no container is paused.)\r\nNo matter which value we choose, if the incoming interval for activations is a little bigger than that, the action will suffer from this.

I asked about this recently in slack and it sounded like the only reason it was low was for the billing cycles being 100ms so public users would not get free compute from async processes after their function completes, but as a default I don't see that as necessary\r\n\r\nAnd understand totally now it works the same as the old scheduler where the scheduler makes a request to the invoker to create container which the invoker proxy will get and unpause the existing container, just the one additional step of the unpaused container then having to retrieve the activation from the scheduler\r\n\r\nI guess my follow up is is there any reason for pause to be less than the container eviction time, or in other words pause at all? Is pausing a strain on resources. To me it seems like constantly pausing and unpausing a container is a bigger strain on resources than just not doing it all if you don't care about billing and what you're users are doing once the function completes as long as the standard resource limits set for the container are still there to protect the vm i.e. the max memory of the container, max file limit, etc.\r\n\r\nI don't think the pause grace needs to be turned off as a default, but maybe we could advertise that if you don't care about user billing and there aren't concerns about performance to the vm and other functions; then maybe the most optimal thing would be to set that config greater than the container idle eviction timeout unless I'm missing something?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/1106747287/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/1106858499","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/5221#issuecomment-1106858499","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/5221","id":1106858499,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAxoOzc5B-VID","user":{"login":"bdoyle0182","id":11879547,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODc5NTQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11879547?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdoyle0182","html_url":"https://github.com/bdoyle0182","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdoyle0182/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdoyle0182/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdoyle0182/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdoyle0182/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdoyle0182/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdoyle0182/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdoyle0182/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdoyle0182/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdoyle0182/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-22T21:00:46Z","updated_at":"2022-04-22T21:00:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Important thing to note about the pause grace value is that the container eviction time is pauseGrace + idleTimeout at least in the old scheduler so increasing the pause grace value dramatically will also increase the time that containers sit around unless that behavior is decoupled","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/1106858499/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/1107151487","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/5221#issuecomment-1107151487","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/5221","id":1107151487,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAxoOzc5B_cp_","user":{"login":"style95","id":3447251,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDcyNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3447251?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95","html_url":"https://github.com/style95","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-23T01:33:13Z","updated_at":"2022-04-23T01:34:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Important thing to note about the pause grace value is that the container eviction time is pauseGrace + idleTimeout at least in the old scheduler so increasing the pause grace value dramatically will also increase the time that containers sit around unless that behavior is decoupled\r\n\r\nExactly. The value I see in this PR is to improve the development experience by increasing the default pause-grace.\r\nI think the default value is mostly used when people give it a shot with OW in their local.\r\nThey would test each feature, and try to run some actions by hand.\r\nSo even if they frequently invoke actions containers would be easily paused in turn the waitTime would increase.\r\n\r\nSince each downstream can freely change the default while deploying OW in production(and I believe they are already doing it), I think we can increase the default.\r\nToo small pause-grace is not well aligned with one of the main ideas behind the FPCScheduler and even it could harm the latency in the old scheduler too.\r\n\r\n10s looks good to me for the old scheduler too but I just wanted to know if there is any history that I am not aware of.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/1107151487/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/1107359298","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/5221#issuecomment-1107359298","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/5221","id":1107359298,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAxoOzc5CAPZC","user":{"login":"JesseStutler","id":38534065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTM0MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38534065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JesseStutler","html_url":"https://github.com/JesseStutler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JesseStutler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JesseStutler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JesseStutler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JesseStutler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JesseStutler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JesseStutler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JesseStutler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JesseStutler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JesseStutler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-23T04:35:30Z","updated_at":"2022-04-23T04:35:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I agree that there is no a priori default value for pause-grace.
