The change to the default properties will impact the Docker image.  It looks like some adjustments to the startup property configuration in the Docker image is going to be necessary.  I will look into it and evaluate potential changes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/841502727/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/841537814","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5077#issuecomment-841537814","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5077","id":841537814,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0MTUzNzgxNA==","user":{"login":"thenatog","id":38888042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg4MDQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38888042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog","html_url":"https://github.com/thenatog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-14T22:46:13Z","updated_at":"2021-05-14T22:46:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I checked the Accumulo page for release notes on this and checked the commits for the 2.0.1 tag, looks like there shouldn't be any compatibility issues with this patch version (as we'd expect).

Typically, most documentation refers to NiFi using 8443 for secure NiFi:\r\n> https://pierrevillard.com/2016/11/29/apache-nifi-1-1-0-secured-cluster-setup/\r\n> https://community.cloudera.com/t5/Community-Articles/Securing-NiFi-Step-by-Step/ta-p/244315\r\n> https://community.cloudera.com/t5/Support-Questions/NiFi-Cannot-replicate-request-to-Node-nifi-domain-net-8443/td-p/283664\r\n\r\nThanks for the testing and feedback @thenatog!  The Administration Guide had a note about 9443 being the default for HTTPS, but this seems like a good opportunity to bring that in line with other common examples, so I will update the default value and documentation to use `8443`.\r\n\r\nI am in the process of making some adjustments to the Docker scripts to enable HTTPS by default, so I will push these updates soon.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/842620761/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/842626077","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5068#issuecomment-842626077","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5068","id":842626077,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0MjYyNjA3Nw==","user":{"login":"thenatog","id":38888042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg4MDQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38888042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog","html_url":"https://github.com/thenatog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-17T20:44:45Z","updated_at":"2021-05-17T20:44:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hmm, yes, it does appear to be a bit of a mix between 8443 and 9443.

@matthew-formosa-gig - I know this is an old one, but happy to spend some cycles on this if you want to get this in. I tried to give the PR a try by running a local ignite instance on Docker but could not send any data in it and I noticed quite a lot of exceptions on the NiFi side. Also when you want to test the thin client, you need to define a cache name, any guidance on how to set this into the Docker container?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/845339872/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/845602211","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5087#issuecomment-845602211","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5087","id":845602211,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0NTYwMjIxMQ==","user":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-21T02:15:33Z","updated_at":"2021-05-21T02:15:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 LGTM, reviewed the code and ran a flow from the stateless assembly (vs the nifi.sh stateless from the top-level) successfully.
