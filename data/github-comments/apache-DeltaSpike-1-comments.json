Should I seperate ArticleController into ArticleBean and ArticleService ?\n\n2, I put @ViewScoped onto ArticleController, because from article list page(list.xhtml), we can click \"edit\" link to go to add.xhtml to edit the slelected article, so we must merge the article when click the save button, that is why I use @ViewScoped. It seemed that, WindowScoped or ViewAccessScoped should also works. I don't know how to make it work when used @RequestScoped, any idea?\n\nthanks!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/deltaspike/issues/comments/247539809/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/deltaspike/issues/comments/253984153","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/deltaspike/pull/65#issuecomment-253984153","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/deltaspike/issues/65","id":253984153,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1Mzk4NDE1Mw==","user":{"login":"johnament","id":108167,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODE2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnament","html_url":"https://github.com/johnament","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnament/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnament/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnament/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnament/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnament/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnament/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnament/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnament/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnament/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-15T13:25:56Z","updated_at":"2016-10-15T13:25:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi, sorry for the delay in looking at this.
