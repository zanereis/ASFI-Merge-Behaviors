commented by Arvind in the JIRA 2328, this single change in command line parser seems not a full solution? Introducing new parameter, but I don't see where it is used. Do you need to update dcscheck script as well?\nCould you explain how unit test of this is done? So maybe I can better understand the solution. \nAlso, I paste Arvind's comments from JIRA to here, you may need to take a look and feedback:\n\n> Thanks for working on this defect. Could you share how these new options ( la, lq, key ) will be used ?\n> For the problem seen when one of the zookeeper nodes/process among the quorum is down, I think we need to pass in the quorum information to the \"-server\" option. Currently we pick one server and port and pass that. With the change if we invoke \"dcs zkcli\" it should default to showing all servers of the quorum like hbase zkcli does:\n> \n> hbase zkcli\n> Connecting to wmstesting-1.novalocal:2181,wmstesting-3.novalocal:2181,wmstesting-2.novalocal:2181...\n> bin/dcs zkcli\n> Connecting to wmstesting-1.novalocal:2181\n> If you do make this change to -server, then note that dcscheck and dcsstart will need to be modified to pick the correct row/column.\n> Other suggestion - we could eliminate the configuration in dcs-site.xml by utilizing the following env variables that get set in a cluster environment:\n> [trafodion@wmstesting-1 dcs-2.2.0]$ env|grep ZOO\n> ZOOKEEPER=zookeeper\n> ZOO_PORT_NODES=wmstesting-2.novalocal:2181,wmstesting-1.novalocal:2181,wmstesting-3.novalocal:2181\n> ZOOKEEPER_PORT=2181\n> ZOOKEEPER_NODES=wmstesting-3.novalocal,wmstesting-1.novalocal,wmstesting-2.novalocal\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/259705009/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/259712867","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/828#issuecomment-259712867","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/828","id":259712867,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1OTcxMjg2Nw==","user":{"login":"selvaganesang","id":8702996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MDI5OTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8702996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang","html_url":"https://github.com/selvaganesang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-10T15:04:04Z","updated_at":"2016-11-10T15:04:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It is not clear what is the intent of moving ExpLobInterfaceInit method from fixup to work method.
