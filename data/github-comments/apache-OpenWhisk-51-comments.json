one of the earlier comments, @sjfink suggested returning \"null\" to indicate action success but abort a sequence. This has the advantage that we don't have to use an \"error\" convention but violates the json object in/out abstraction.\r\n\r\nHere's a proposal to admit \"null\" without necessarily changing the action's `Dictionary -> Dictionary` signature.\r\n\r\nSuppose the signature of the action was `Option[Dictionary] => Option[Dictionary]`. Then one has to check the input to determine if it's defined or empty (that is, check if there is a value provided or none).\r\n\r\nWe can reconcile this with our current action signature by allowing actions to return a `Dictionary` or `null`, where the former is conceptually boxed to `Some[Dictionary]` and the latter is boxed to `None`. Then, we guarantee that when you invoke an action it's always `Some[Dictionary]` and never `None`. That is, if the argument is `None` your action is not invoked. In this way, the action is only allowed to map over the defined value and not the empty value. Another way to understand this is that an action receiving `Null` returns `Null` by definition.\r\n\r\nFrom a composition point of view it's sound as in one can compose g(f(option)) as long as they only map on the option (in the Scala sense for example). From the sequence implementation point of view, the action returning `Null` aborts the rest of the sequence but the activation is recorded as having a successful status (and _not_ an error). (Somewhat formally our actions are `Try[Dictionary] => Try[Dictionary]` and this model changes the action signature to `Try[Some[Dictionary]] => Try[Option[Dictionary]]`.)\r\n\r\nSo the proposal (elaborating Steve's above) which is superior then using a convention on a reserved field:\r\n1. allow `null` as a valid return from actions (note that `null` is a valid JSON value, not a JSON object)\r\n2. modify the sequence scheduler so that it aborts execution (with status recorded as `success`) at the first action returning `null`\r\n3. record the result as null in the activation record\r\n4. actions must explicitly `return null` to indicate they are returning no value (that is a naked `return` otherwise continues to map to `return {}` for node actions).\r\n\r\nIn other words, I move to accept @sjfink's \"Proposal: if an action returns \"null\", it is considered \"success\", but terminates a sequence.\" Thumbs up in favor, comments to elaborate or refine.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/265589172/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/265589528","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/387#issuecomment-265589528","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/387","id":265589528,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NTU4OTUyOA==","user":{"login":"psuter","id":245547,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTU0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245547?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/psuter","html_url":"https://github.com/psuter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psuter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psuter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psuter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psuter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psuter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psuter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psuter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psuter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psuter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-07T22:11:02Z","updated_at":"2016-12-07T22:11:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"In my view #1539 addressed this through environment variables and by deferring to the `openwhisk` npm package.
