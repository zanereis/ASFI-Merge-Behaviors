For more current github projects, for instance, presto, they would like to split them into small sub repos, making each one clear.\n\nOn the other hand, looking at some popular open source projects, I could not see “contrib” folder: jQuery, MongoDB, Redis, Puppet, Ruby on Rails, Jenkins. Django has a contrib folder and the role of folder is already explained here: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/\n\n```\nDjango aims to follow Python’s “batteries included” philosophy. It ships with a variety of extra, optional tools that solve common Web-development problems.\n\nThis code lives in django/contrib in the Django distribution. This document gives a rundown of the packages in contrib, along with any dependencies those packages have.\n```\n\nSo, I am not convinced by the opinion that contrib folder is for experimental / getting started. I think it is more for tools building on top of the core part.\n\nTo summarize, it can be a good idea to move all scheduler-implementations and similar things to an individual repo (to an individual folder is debatable). But whether to move them bases on the nature of those projects, rather than the quality of those projects.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/232883403/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/232961234","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/1059#issuecomment-232961234","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1059","id":232961234,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMjk2MTIzNA==","user":{"login":"ajorgensen","id":509779,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTc3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/509779?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajorgensen","html_url":"https://github.com/ajorgensen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajorgensen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajorgensen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajorgensen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajorgensen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajorgensen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajorgensen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajorgensen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajorgensen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajorgensen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-15T14:12:04Z","updated_at":"2016-07-15T14:12:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@avflor I think aside from my initial comments it looks good to me.

@maosongfu \nI agree with @maosongfu now. I had a couple of conversations with some OSS developers here. A `contrib` directory is primarily used for \"add-on\" features. For e.g. scripts and tools for debugging. There are a few projects where the `contrib` directory is used for un-important and un-supported code. However that may result in hard to manage \"trash\" and may be discouraging for new contributors. A scheduler implementation is core to Heron. So I think the Mesos scheduler should be added to core. \n\nHowever, I am not sure how to manage \"not-for-production\" contributions. A experimental feature may starve for users if left in its own branch. So I would prefer merging them in master. But how will a user know if he is using a experimental feature? Should we print a warning on the console.\n\nWith respect to this patch, I think a few minor issues are pending in addition to fault tolerance cases. Also, I may not be able to deploy and test this on a mesos cluster.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/233023388/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/233026343","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1084#issuecomment-233026343","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1084","id":233026343,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMzAyNjM0Mw==","user":{"login":"avflor","id":18666312,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjY2MzEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18666312?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor","html_url":"https://github.com/avflor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-15T18:11:32Z","updated_at":"2016-07-15T18:11:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ajorgensen

I noticed when I run in local mode that the number of stream managers is picked based on the topology config. However, the binpacking algorithm decides on its own how many containers to use. The number of stream managers launched should be based on the result of packing algorithm. I enhanced the SchedulerMain.java code to take the value from the PackedPlan. I made the necessary change to the junit tests as well. I also changed the build files so that the Heron client can use the binpacking algorithm. Finally, I made the padding configurable and changed the binpacking algorithm to accommodate it.
