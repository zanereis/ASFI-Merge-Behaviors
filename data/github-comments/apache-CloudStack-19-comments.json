@rafaelweingartner \n\nThe XenServer plugin build failed:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5129209/8519478/443bd1f8-23d3-11e5-8aa1-51a7d7bca2c6.png)\n\nI'm trying to find out why it did so.\n\nA way to move forward would be for me, or someone else, to try to test your PR. I'm busy with another PR now, but if nobody picks your change, I might have a look later today.\n\nConcerning your comments about XcpServerNetworkUsageCommandWrapper and XenServer56NetworkUsageCommandWrapper being almost the same, that's due to the refactor I did on the CitrixResourceBase class. The refactor looked only at change the structure of the code, not behaviour. If 2 wrappers look/are the same, we need to do further work. I will take some time to look into it as well.\n\nCheers,\nWilder\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/118787549/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/118787879","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/560#issuecomment-118787879","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/560","id":118787879,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExODc4Nzg3OQ==","user":{"login":"wilderrodrigues","id":5129209,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMjkyMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5129209?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues","html_url":"https://github.com/wilderrodrigues","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-06T09:42:18Z","updated_at":"2015-07-06T09:42:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Travis jobs from 3591.1 to 3591.5 (inclusive) failed due to time out.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/118787879/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/118788393","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/560#issuecomment-118788393","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/560","id":118788393,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExODc4ODM5Mw==","user":{"login":"wilderrodrigues","id":5129209,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMjkyMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5129209?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues","html_url":"https://github.com/wilderrodrigues","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-06T09:45:44Z","updated_at":"2015-07-06T09:45:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @rafaelweingartner \n\nThe reason why the build failed can be found here: https://builds.apache.org/job/cloudstack-pull-requests/688/org.apache.cloudstack$cloud-plugin-hypervisor-xenserver/console\n\nTo sum it up: your changes did not pass the audit due to tab entries in the code. That's a code-style audit.\n\nDid you use Eclipse/IntelliJ to change the Java code? If so, you will need to change your code settings to cope with 4-spaces instead of 1-tab. After that, you will have to format your change and commit again to the same branch you used to create the PR. Jenkins should be fine and we can proceed with testing/merging your changes.\n\nCheers,\nWilder\n\nErros
