This means that an exception was thrown during the shutdown process.  Looking at the code the only exception that could have caused this is an InterruptedException or something caused by it (or else the entire processes would have exited).</p>\n\n<p>This means that the ProcessSimulator partially shut down the worker, then the worker threw the exception, and ProcessSimulator failed to remove the worker from the map.  That way when the follow on code to kill anything registered with the process simulator that might have leaked is called it ends up trying to shoot the process yet again, which the code we found does not like.</p>\n\n<p>Everything seems perfectly reasonable, except for the part where some of our data structures don't like to be shut down multiple times.  This seems against what most other software does.  Exactly once is hard so lets make sure at least once works.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612964291/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612964297","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/5957#issuecomment-2612964297","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/5957","id":2612964297,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI5NjQyOTc=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-28T20:01:15Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T16:46:35Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=srdo\">srdo</a>:</i>\n<p>Thanks for the explanation.

I'm running into the timeout for the test using the Kafka spout fairly consistently though. I've posted a small PR against the 1.x version of the branch to disable the timeout in local mode. Tests may fail spuriously due to a slow machine, or bolts/spouts being slow to close.</p>\n\n<p>Raising the timeout in shutdownAllWorkers isn't guaranteed to work for everyone, and making it configurable is fiddly in tests and irrelevant for distributed mode, due to the 1 second limit on worker suicide. Giving up on shutting down the worker properly leads to leaking resources in local mode, since we can't just kill the JVM. I think removing the timeout for shutdownAllWorkers in local mode is a decent fix. It's still very visible if a Slot is hanging for some reason, since the warning about a slow Slot shutdown is still printed, and we avoid dealing with issues like Slots being slow to shutdown due to tests with a high fork count, or tests on slow machines, or optimistic bolt/spout close functions that don't time limit themselves.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612964333/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/257481141","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1754#issuecomment-257481141","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1754","id":257481141,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NzQ4MTE0MQ==","user":{"login":"vesense","id":6711230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MTEyMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6711230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense","html_url":"https://github.com/vesense","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-01T03:34:25Z","updated_at":"2016-11-01T03:34:25Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This PR is on top of https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1751\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/257481141/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612655263","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/5115#issuecomment-2612655263","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/5115","id":2612655263,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI2NTUyNjM=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-01T10:50:43Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T14:24:54Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=abhishek.agarwal\">abhishek.agarwal</a>:</i>\n<p>The logic of deciding, whether to continue running a thread based on the return type of callable, is really bad.

And I can see the storm 0.9.6 has removed guava in the code.
