Critically, it includes any queued task, no matter how it was run. The problem is that the `subdag` is being run by a `BackfillJob` with its OWN loop checking for queued tasks. So:\n1. the `BackfillJob` running a CeleryExecutor puts the job in \"queued\" status\n2. the 'BackfillJob' running a CeleryExecutor submits the task to the executor\n3. near-simultaneously, the `SchedulerJob` running a different CeleryExecutor (because it's on a different machine or process) submits the task to its own executor\n4. Whichever task is run first flips the task from queued -> running. Normally, further run requests would be ignored, but the second request comes in and is followed, flipping the state back to queued.\n5. Repeat.\n\nSolution: `prioritize_queued` only considers tasks in the Scheduler's DagBag and ignores subdags on the  assumption they are being run on their own.\n\nThis isn't a complete solution -- the problem will crop up if someone is running a scheduler along any other kind of job because the scheduler will try to run all queued tasks (in fact I wonder if it's the cause of some of the weird backfill errors people have been seeing). To do this properly, I will make the scheduler only work with its \"own\" tasks -- but that will involve more work. Please let me know if this solution works for now.\n\np.s. if you want to really stress this scenario, set your scheduler_heartbeat to 0\n\nThanks!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/203626971/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/203645119","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1264#issuecomment-203645119","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1264","id":203645119,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwMzY0NTExOQ==","user":{"login":"landscape-bot","id":10010231,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDEwMjMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10010231?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/landscape-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-30T21:37:00Z","updated_at":"2016-03-30T21:37:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[![Code

are you running a Scheduler? \n\nThe scheduler uses the last run, not the `start_date`, when scheduling dags. So when you backfilled the dag, the scheduler observed the last run time and began scheduling. The clue here is that the Scheduler actually picks a starting date 5 days BEFORE the last run time. I'm not totally sure why -- perhaps @mistercrunch has a specific reason? In #1271, I added a check so that the scheduler won't schedule any runs prior to the `start_date` (though it still tries to go back 5 days), so that should clear up some of the confusion.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/204861026/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/204861252","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1271#issuecomment-204861252","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1271","id":204861252,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNDg2MTI1Mg==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-03T03:35:38Z","updated_at":"2016-04-03T03:35:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/builds/5642539/badge)](https://coveralls.io/builds/5642539)\n\nCoverage increased (+1.5%) to 68.593% when pulling **c1eb83adbf9d4371dab7dd545c593cc5a853fb8b on jlowin:subdag_pool_issue_1225** into **526e564ecb0859e50b7b8da31a31c0b61aa3ec3c on airbnb:master**.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/204861252/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
