We install them in the --user mode also. They will not be on the user PATH, so it is important to call them with their absolute paths. That should be: `$HOME/.local/bin/tox` for Jenkins. However note that this is platform dependent and for example on osx it will be `$HOME/Library/Python/2.7/bin/tox`. \n\nThe install path could be customized by setting the `PYTHONUSERBASE` environment variable. I have tried this only on linux and I am not sure how it will behave on other systems.\n\n```\nexport PYTHONUSERBASE=/somedirectory\npip install --user tox\n/somedirectory/bin/tox ...\n```\n\nCleanup of this is also easier.

The way you have it is fine to get unblocked. It would be even better to tag specific test methods with `@Category(StaticSideInputs.class)` (from the [capability matrix doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fICxq32t9yWn9qXhmT07xpclHeHX2VlUyVtpi2WzzGM/edit?usp=sharing) shared by @tgroh) and then use `<excludedGroups>` in your pom. This way you aren't eliminating the whole test class, just the method.\n\n**Test timeouts**: It may be infeasible to run all these `RunnableOnService` tests in the presubmit and in Travis. For Dataflow, we run just a couple in the presubmit and then the rest as a [post-submit Jenkins job](https://builds.apache.org/job/beam_PostCommit_RunnableOnService_GoogleCloudDataflow). It probably makes sense to do this for many runners, so that is also no problem. Do you know whether it is just overheads or whether there is a real performance problem?\n\nFor right now, there's a [RAT plugin failure](https://builds.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_MavenVerify/2177/org.apache.beam$beam-parent/console) in the `runners-parent` module. If we fix that, then then Jenkins should be willing to run your tests to completion even if it takes a long time.\n\nFrom there, since traffic on the branch will be low enough, I think we can probably check it in to a feature branch and then set up the postsubmit job and try to see if we can speed up the

I have spent some time trying to figure out what is happening to no luck. I have been hitting into the same problem you mentioned. I am not a maven expert, I am guessing it is tripping off when it is trying to execute verify phase from the parent pom.xml where a partially define exec:java goal is used.. Presumably this change will require some changes there too.\n\nAt this point you can either do a partial submit. By removing the parent dependency in pom.xml and therefore not triggering jenkins runs at all. Or shelve this change for now. \n\nI can spend more time on this in about 2 weeks. Depending on your preference I can take over this change or help you fighting the maven.
