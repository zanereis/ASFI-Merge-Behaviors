made hive storage handler via approch (1). Because current hive does not provide opportunity to change DAG in planning stage(which is possible in Spark), I've used select query with filters and projections. The bottom line is that it was too slow. If hive takes 100msec for processing n rows, historical node can make them in less than 50msec. But json serde + network takes 100~300msec which ruins overall performance. it's sub second for single query but retrieving lot's of rows via hundreds of queries(1G tez task throws OOM for 3000+ rows) was not the right way to be done. I have some ideas to improve this but it's low priority job and seemed not be done in a month or two.\n\nps. But still my colleagues like it because simple select SQL is not ran on MR or TEZ, which means the result is returned in sub-second, of course. Some uses it loading druid datasource into hive table by using CTAS or insert

that sounds great, is that public?
