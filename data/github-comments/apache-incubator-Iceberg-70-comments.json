Sort orders are attached to table metadata, so loading the order should be a simple hash map lookup.\r\n\r\nI guess in order to do that, we may need to add the file's sort order map in `FileScanTask`, as it seems like in readers (e.g. `RowDataReader`) we rely on it for reading rows, meanwhile we don't have the table available for metadata lookup?\r\n\r\n> Engines must specify which sort order was used to write a file explicitly.\r\n\r\n(Sorry for the naive question) I guess the sort order needs to be decided when building the writer (e.g. add a `sortOrder` parameter in [`SparkWriter` writer factory](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/master/spark3/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/spark/source/SparkWrite.java#L518)), and how does the engine know which sort order to use when writing files? Maybe the sort order could be an optional thing to specify when a job is created (e.g. as part of the the sql command for ingesting data) , and thus the engine will already know the sort order to use when it creates the writer, although some validations might need to be done against table metadata before that (e.g. check for such sort order exists, create one or abort if not); and if nothing is specified for this job/command, the engine will look for table's default sort order, and use it for creating the writer?

The reason that we have designed the flink specific manifests is https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1185/files#r478772412 . When committing the iceberg transaction during completing checkpoint,  the iceberg-files-committer will read all data files from this flink specific manifest file to construct a new __iceberg__ manifest files.   You could see more details in this issue https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/1959. \r\n\r\nFor your issue,  I'm pretty sure that flink did not commit any iceberg transaction after you enabled the version feature in S3 bucket.  But I'm not sure what's the reason causing this.  Did you have any logs indicating the flink job was failover  (error log or stacktrace ? ) .

Additionally, is there any more stacktrace that was left off? It seems like there might be something after the `Caused by: java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException`. As an example, I found this in the twitter `Chill` issues:\r\n\r\nExample stack trace with helpful info after the UnsupportedOperationException: https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/kryo/issues/472\r\n```\r\ncom.esotericsoftware.kryo.KryoException: java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: ConfigObject is immutable, you can't call Map.put\r\n[error] Serialization trace: ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn general, the `Caused by` portion of the stack trace is likely to be the most informative. It's not exactly straight forward to tell what's happening here, as there's some code that seems to maybe be commented out for `registerSerializer` that could very well be very important to this serialization issue.\r\n\r\nSerializability issues of this sort are not an uncommon problem with both Kryo and Flink. In Flink, if one does not provide a custom type serializer, then it falls back to kryo. Kryo has limitations on its ability to (de)serialize objects, such as the mentioned limitation on serializing immutable objects (as well as some issues around fields that are or are not marked as final etc).\r\n\r\nIf I had to guess, based on quickly poking around the code, specifically the `org.apache.iceberg.Metrics` class, I would say that likely the `Metrics` are being instantiated with an immutable map for that field. Kryo likely does not like this. If you're looking to take up this issue and don't have background in Kryo / Flink serialization, this stack overflow question might help you get a better understanding of the issue (as well the the above linked issue from the kryo repo):\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/14499670/serializing-and-deserializing-object-arrays-in-kryo\r\n\r\nI can follow up with more information if need be, but it would be helpful if you provided any further stack trace after the `Caused by java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException` as well as any information about types that you register with the flink runtime (as it appears there is a registerSerializer() function that's probably highly relevant here).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/756072537/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/756073479","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2031#issuecomment-756073479","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2031","id":756073479,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1NjA3MzQ3OQ==","user":{"login":"rymurr","id":2022305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMjIzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2022305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr","html_url":"https://github.com/rymurr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-07T11:58:55Z","updated_at":"2021-01-07T11:58:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I am not a Flink expert but my reading of the [javadoc](https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/master/flink-table/flink-table-common/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/table/factories/TableFactory.java#L54) is that we could accept everything but it seems like its not recommended.

I didn't see this until today.\r\n\r\nRight now, we have a fixed set of transforms because we want to have consistent support across engines. To do that, we want a small set of transforms that are well-defined so that there isn't a huge cost to implementing support. Otherwise, we'd end up with inconsistent features across processing engines, which we really want to avoid.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to add new transforms and possibly even to provide a way to customize transforms, but we would need a way to plug in code that is used by Iceberg. The hardest thing to implement is projection, which takes a predicate for rows in a table and converts it to a predicate that matches partition values. That's difficult to write and can cause problems if you get it wrong, but I think we can generalize it into two cases: monotonic transforms (like year, month, day, hour, truncate) and other transforms (like bucket). Then you'd only have to supply the `apply` implementation and a few booleans and Iceberg could handle the rest.\r\n\r\nI think it is reasonable for users to need additional partition functions, but I hope that we can add functions to Iceberg when they are needed so that everyone benefits.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/756492770/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/756495523","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2048#issuecomment-756495523","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2048","id":756495523,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1NjQ5NTUyMw==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-08T01:49:37Z","updated_at":"2021-01-08T01:49:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for working on this, @holdenk!

Similarly, `bytes` is part of the thing being configured and we would not expect to see other properties nested within `size`.\r\n\r\nOther projects use a convention where all words are separated by `.` regardless, but I think it is easier to understand the context hierarchy if things described by more than one word are kept together.\r\n\r\nAlso, `lock.impl` vs `lock-impl` is a fuzzy case since `lock` _is_ a group, but I think this should match the others, like `io-impl`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/756931684/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/756933941","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1893#issuecomment-756933941","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1893","id":756933941,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1NjkzMzk0MQ==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-08T18:50:24Z","updated_at":"2021-01-08T18:50:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'll
