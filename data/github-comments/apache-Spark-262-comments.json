I'll soon send a PR. \nThe problem of the original implementation is that the config(host:port) is static and allows only one host:port. Once host or port changed, the flume agent should be restarted to reload the conf.\nTo solve it, one solution is to set a virtual address instead of a real address in the flume conf. Meanwhile, a address router was introduced that can tell us all the real addresses are bound to a virtual address and notify such events that a real address is added to or removed from the virtual address.\nI found the router can be easily implemented by the zookeeper. In such scenario:\n1. A spark receiver selects a free port and creates a tmp node with the path /path/to/logicalhost/host:port to zookeeper when started. \nIf three receivers started, three nodes (host1:port1, host2:port2, host3:port3) will be created under /path/to/logicalhost;\n2. On the side of flume agent, the flume sink gets the children nodes (host1:port1, host2:port2, host3:port3) from /path/to/logicalhost and buffers them into a ClientPool.\nWhen append called, it selects a client from ClientPool in a round-robin manner and call client.append to send events.\n3. If any receiver crashed/started, the tmp zk node will be removed/added, and then ClientPool will remove/add the client from the buffer since it watched those zk children events.\nIn my implementation:\nLogicalHostRouter is the implementation of the address router. You know, the spark or flume should not know the existence of zk. \nThe ZkProxy is an encapsulation of the zk curator client.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50851611/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50851677","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1712#issuecomment-50851677","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1712","id":50851677,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwODUxNjc3","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-01T06:00:03Z","updated_at":"2014-08-01T06:00:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA

He had feedback on a few things which I'll summarize here. There are a couple orthogonal issues going on here. Here were his suggestions:\n1. _Scripts like start-thriftserver.sh should expose one coherent set of options rather than distinguishing between spark-submit and other options. _ The idea was to make this more convenient/less confusing for users. So this would mean that the scripts would have to match on the more specific options and make sure those are delivered separately to `spark-submit`. This makes the internals more complicated, but for the users it's simpler. Also, because we control the total set of options for internal tools, we can make sure there is no collision in the naming.\n2. _ If we implement `--` as a divider, it should be fully backwards compatible. _ For instance, we need to support users that were doing this in Spark 1.0:\n\n```\n./spark-submit --master local myJar.jar --userOpt a --userOpt b -- --userOpt c\n```\n\ni.e. user programs that used `--` in their own options. The way to fully support this is to make the use of `--` mutually exclusive with specifying a primary resource. So this means a user can _either_ do:\n\n```\n./spark-submit --master local --jars myJar.jar -- --userOpt a --userOpt b\n```\n\nor they can do \n\n```\n./spark-submit --master local myJar.jar --userOpt a --userOpt b\n```\n\nSo basically, when the parser arrives at an unrecognized option (which we assume to be a resource) we always treat the rest of the list as user options, even if the user options happen to have a `--` in them.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50854779/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50855070","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1525#issuecomment-50855070","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1525","id":50855070,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwODU1MDcw","user":{"login":"kayousterhout","id":1108612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDg2MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1108612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout","html_url":"https://github.com/kayousterhout","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-01T07:02:22Z","updated_at":"2014-08-01T07:02:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I will take a look at this tomorrow.\n\nOn Thu, Jul 31, 2014 at 10:37 PM, Zhihui Li notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> @tgravescs https://github.com/tgravescs @kayousterhout\n> https://github.com/kayousterhout can you close this PR before code\n> frozen of 1.1 release?

Each job launches a many short-lived tasks, each of which persists a single block. The minimality of each task allows the listener bus to keep posting events very quickly while placing a lot of stress on the listeners on consuming the events.\n\n```\nsc.parallelize(1 to 20000, 100).persist().count()\n```\n\n**Before:** The max queue length observed reaches 10000 at around the 65th job, and finally reaches 16730 after the last job. Before this PR, this is enough to cause the queue to start dropping events. The average time spent in `StorageUtils.updateRddInfo` (this was renamed) is 176.25ms.\n\n**After:** The max queue length never went above 130, and the average time spent in `StorageUtils.updateRddInfo` is 15.47ms, more than 10 times faster than before. As a baseline for comparison, running the same job 100 times without persisting anything yields a max queue length of 55.\n\nThe dark side of the story (there is always a dark side), however, is that this improvement is only observed for RDDs with not too many partitions. Although the new code iterates through only a few RDDs' blocks instead of all RDD blocks known to mankind, it is still slow if say a single RDD contains all the blocks, in which case we still have to iterate through all the RDD blocks. For instance, this will be just as slow as before if we had executed `sc.parallelize(1 to 20000, 10000).persist().count()` once.\n\nLong story short, we have reduced this from _O(blocks)_ to _O(blocks in the updated RDDs)_, which is a significant decrease for many but not all workloads. Maybe we can do better.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50857283/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50857406","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1147#issuecomment-50857406","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1147","id":50857406,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwODU3NDA2","user":{"login":"chenghao-intel","id":2367031,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjcwMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2367031?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel","html_url":"https://github.com/chenghao-intel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-01T07:37:41Z","updated_at":"2014-08-01T07:37:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you @marmbrus I've updated the code as suggested.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50857406/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50857528","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1313#issuecomment-50857528","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1313","id":50857528,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwODU3NTI4","user":{"login":"mateiz","id":228859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODg1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz","html_url":"https://github.com/mateiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-01T07:39:14Z","updated_at":"2014-08-01T07:39:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Awesome, looks like this passes now!
