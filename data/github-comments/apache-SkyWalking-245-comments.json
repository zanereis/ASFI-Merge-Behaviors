Do you mean Istio.1.10 not support skywalking for tracing? Thanks for your replying.\r\n\r\nWe don't have that support. Tracing in Istio is really very fancy, it just activates tracer in envoy.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/874702277/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/874741431","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/7235#issuecomment-874741431","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/7235","id":874741431,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3NDc0MTQzMQ==","user":{"login":"whl12345","id":36367435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MzY3NDM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36367435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/whl12345","html_url":"https://github.com/whl12345","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whl12345/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whl12345/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whl12345/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whl12345/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whl12345/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whl12345/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whl12345/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whl12345/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whl12345/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-06T13:04:37Z","updated_at":"2021-07-06T13:04:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Your plugin test case doesn't pass, please check the logs and verify locally.\r\n\r\nIt's my problem and I have fixed it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/874741431/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/874751456","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/7235#issuecomment-874751456","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/7235","id":874751456,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3NDc1MTQ1Ng==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-06T13:16:59Z","updated_at":"2021-07-06T13:16:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> > Your plugin test case doesn't pass, please check the logs and verify locally.\r\n> \r\n> It's my problem and I have fixed it.\r\n\r\nStill failing.

If you want to do service based sample rate setting, the first step should make it supported in static configuration. Sample rate is a static configuration in the `application.yml`, you should make it separate in another `trace-sample-rate-setting.yml`, then, make the dynamic configuration works. Also, this should not be a different configuration than existing logic, otherwise, the users would be very confused, which sample rate would take effect if they set both.\r\n> > \r\n> > \r\n> > Like that configure sampling rate by the same configuration in the `application.yml`?\r\n> > ```\r\n> > agent-analyzer:\r\n> >   selector: ${SW_AGENT_ANALYZER:default}\r\n> >   default:\r\n> >     #sampleRate: ${SW_TRACE_SAMPLE_RATE:10000} # The config had moved to 'traceSampleRateSettingFile' and had been replaced by 'global.sampleRate' that the config in 'traceSampleRateSettingFile'.\r\n> >     #slowTraceSegmentThreshold: ${SW_SLOW_TRACE_SEGMENT_THRESHOLD:-1} # The config had moved to 'traceSampleRateSettingFile' and had been replaced by 'global.duration' that the config in 'traceSampleRateSettingFile'.\r\n> >     traceSampleRateSettingFile: ${SW_TRACE_SAMPLE_RATE_SETTING_FILE:trace-sample-rate-setting.yml}\r\n> > ```\r\n> > \r\n> > \r\n> >     \r\n> >       \r\n> >     \r\n> > \r\n> >       \r\n> >     \r\n> > \r\n> >     \r\n> >   \r\n> > And `trace-sample-rate-setting.yml`:\r\n> > ```\r\n> > global:\r\n> >   sampleRate: 10000 # the replace the old config `sampleRate` in  the application.yml.\r\n> >   duration: 10000 # the replace the old config `slowTraceSegmentThreshold` in  the application.yml\r\n> > services:\r\n> >   - name: serverName # the server name which show skywalking-ui\r\n> >     sampleRate: 1000 # endpoint latitude.

Only service sampling rate would be accepted if this PR is ready.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/875324729/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/875326417","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/7253#issuecomment-875326417","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/7253","id":875326417,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3NTMyNjQxNw==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-07T06:33:29Z","updated_at":"2021-07-07T06:33:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> 1.
