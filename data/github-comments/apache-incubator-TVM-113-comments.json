There are 2 reasons why I am hesitant to do it\r\n> \r\n> * In case of your suggestion, we will directly return default schedule i.e. tvm compute function. If we put the check outside as done in the PR, we can atleast use the schedule_conv_NCHWc schedule, which gives better performance than the default schedule.\r\n\r\nMy previous context of assert error is here: https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/4f10a90e3e2ec18071612bed657108b219bc6796/topi/python/topi/x86/conv2d.py#L278-L288 Current your PR restrict kernel dtype must be `int8` for NHWC int8 computation.\r\n\r\nIf we restrict `NCHWc`, I looked more. I think it is ok, we could use FP32 schedule for it and should have better performance than current schedule. Personally I suggest we should write int8 schedule for non-skylake haraware in the future. i.e.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    if check_skylake(target):\r\n        int32_lanes = 16\r\n    else:\r\n        # new schedule for non-skylake int8 computation\r\n        #return s\r\n```\r\n\r\nI find we only write the schedule for skylake haraware for int8, I think it doesn't make sense in fact.

I think in future as LLVM gets more mature for int8 Intel instructions, we can refine this schedule.\r\n\r\nI think it is not only about HW-supported int8 instructions but also no HW-supported int8 instructions, For example Haswell. I think it is ok to use Tensorize for skylake. My point is for no HW-supported int8 cpu architecture, we also should have one int8 schedule, not just `return s` or use FP32 schedule.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/512134489/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/512192598","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/3163#issuecomment-512192598","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3163","id":512192598,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMjE5MjU5OA==","user":{"login":"FrozenGene","id":7287321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyODczMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7287321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene","html_url":"https://github.com/FrozenGene","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-17T10:12:00Z","updated_at":"2019-07-17T10:12:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@kparzysz-quic After reading https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/introducing-hexagon-backend/2421/13 again, about IDL preprocess, I think we could add one option like `USE_HEXAGON_SDK`.

So given that, all shapes are static - and indeed in our use-case we also experimented with 'inlining' the sparsity structure (i.e. specifying the sparsity pattern as a `const_matrix` and unrolling the outer loops, so there were zero data-dependent branches at runtime) - this helps a bit for smaller MMs, but hurts for larger MMs (probably icache bound).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/512611046/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/512611113","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/3562#issuecomment-512611113","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3562","id":512611113,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMjYxMTExMw==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-17T23:54:14Z","updated_at":"2019-07-17T23:54:14Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This seems to be indeed a mistake. @zacario-li can you send in a patch?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/512611113/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/512611351","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/3240#issuecomment-512611351","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3240","id":512611351,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMjYxMTM1MQ==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-17T23:55:29Z","updated_at":"2019-07-17T23:55:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"it depends on the type.
