In JMLC we can have inputs which are not cleaned up by `rmvar` but for which `isCleanupEnabled = true`. So these pointers end up being freed by `guardedCudaFree` in `clearTemporaryMemory`, but the associated GPUObject remains in `GPUMatrixMemoryManager.gpuObjects`. We then try to free this pointer again the next time the script is invoked and we get an exception. An example would be the feature vector for prediction. These change each time a prepared script is invoked (so `isCleanupEnabled = true`), but are not cleaned up by an `rmvar` instruction. \r\n\r\nThis causes a single `Pointer` to be associated with several different `GPUObjects` which can cause us to try and free a pointer twice leading to an exception. We could fix this issue by adding a method which removes non-dirty, unlocked, GPUObjects for which cleanup is enabled from the memory manager as part of the logic for `GPUContext.cleanupTemporaryMemory()`. However, this will add a performance cost as we need to do an extra scan of the list of GPUObjects. Note that it's not clear to me why these variables are not cleaned up by `rmvar` in JMLC.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/431697179/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/431697781","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/837#issuecomment-431697781","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/837","id":431697781,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMTY5Nzc4MQ==","user":{"login":"mboehm7","id":13721609,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzIxNjA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13721609?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7","html_url":"https://github.com/mboehm7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-21T19:42:00Z","updated_at":"2018-10-21T19:42:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"well, although I don't know the details here, if the prediction vectors are passed from outside into JMLC then we can't compile a rmvar because a user might still want to use the variable afterwards (or even pass it into another prepared script invocation). \r\n\r\nIf the GPU cleanup is an issue, you might want to think about something like Spark's ContextCleaner, which simply registers a weak reference on the object and listens on its queue - if the weak reference is cleared, you know the application program can't reach the object anymore and hence it can be lazily cleaned up from the GPU memory manager.

However, `nvprof` indicates that the most costly operations are convolution followed by device to host transfer, so there may still be some unnecessary copying going on.

We can continue to support older Spark 2.1 version and can get away with warning on Spark 2.3 in the following setups:\r\n- Invoked without any Spark SQL code\r\n- Part of Scala/Java pipeline (for example: if invoked via spark-shell)\r\n- With PySpark if and only if we recommend our users to not provide any jars in the `driver-class-path or jars` (see setup 5 and 6)\r\n2. If we are uncomfortable with the above restriction, we should consider merging this PR.\r\n- Though I have validated that above Python code works with Spark 2.2.3 with a warning, I did not run exhaustive testing to guarantee backward compatibility support for older Spark 2.1 and 2.2 (with the exception of warning).\r\n   ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/475413637/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/477330666","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/745#issuecomment-477330666","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/745","id":477330666,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NzMzMDY2Ng==","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-27T20:16:58Z","updated_at":"2019-03-27T20:16:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"HI Niketan, can you review this once. \r\ncc @niketanpansare ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/477330666/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/477335070","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/745#issuecomment-477335070","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/745","id":477335070,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NzMzNTA3MA==","user":{"login":"niketanpansare","id":11686380,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjg2Mzgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11686380?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare","html_url":"https://github.com/niketanpansare","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-27T20:29:52Z","updated_at":"2019-03-27T20:29:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I ran this test on my local cluster and it completed successfully:\r\n```\r\nRunning org.apache.sysml.test.integration.functions.codegenalg.AlgorithmPCA\r\nTests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 50.276 sec - in org.apache.sysml.test.integration.functions.codegenalg.AlgorithmPCA\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet's give wait for a day in case @bertholdreinwald or @mboehm7 have additional suggestions.
