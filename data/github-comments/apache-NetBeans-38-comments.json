It would be great if you could update the PR with that change.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/497076997/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/497079150","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/1269#issuecomment-497079150","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/1269","id":497079150,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NzA3OTE1MA==","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-29T19:34:32Z","updated_at":"2019-05-29T19:34:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Unfortunately their branding rules are very strict about color tweaking (i.e. none allowed at all).\r\n\r\nThis raises the question: The logos, where do they come from and how are they licensed?

Hopefully it addresses some of your concerns.\r\n\r\n> I have some doubts, that the Scripting API module is helpful though. \r\n\r\n`Scripting` API allows anyone to plug in their preferred engine of choice.\r\n\r\n> If other engines are used, the user will have a false sense of security, that is not in place. \r\n\r\nThe `ALLOWED_PAC_ENGINES` API allows vendor of a NetBeans Platform based application to restrict which engine is used for PAC resolution and thus guarantee the security is in place.\r\n\r\n> I see, that the ClassLoader magic is helpful here, but is that enough to make it worth it? \r\n\r\nThere is a lot of `JavaScriptEngineTest`s that check and compare the behavior of all the known engines - `Nashorn`, `Graal.js` and `GraalVM:js` - all of them behave more or less identically and seem to be sufficiently secure. True, the security of `Nashorn` and `Graal.js` is achieved by special configuration of the engines via properties, reflection and `ClassLoader` magic. On the other hand `GraalVM:js` is configured via public API method calls only. As such I trust it the most and I made it the first choice for PAC resolution in the NetBeans IDE.\r\n\r\nHowever I don't want to restrict freedom of NetBeans Platform vendors. They are encouraged to provide  other engines and configure their security before enabling their usage in the `ALLOWED_PAC_ENGINES` branding API.\r\n\r\n> I'm ok with merging this\r\n\r\nGreat. I'll give you guys few more days and then finally close this eight months long endeavor of mine, hopefully.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/497223020/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/497248722","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/1237#issuecomment-497248722","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/1237","id":497248722,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NzI0ODcyMg==","user":{"login":"vikasprabhakar","id":32299100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjk5MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32299100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikasprabhakar","html_url":"https://github.com/vikasprabhakar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikasprabhakar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikasprabhakar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikasprabhakar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikasprabhakar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikasprabhakar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikasprabhakar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikasprabhakar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikasprabhakar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikasprabhakar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-30T08:23:12Z","updated_at":"2019-05-30T08:23:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> [NETBEANS-2583](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NETBEANS-2583) and [NETBEANS-2584](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NETBEANS-2584)\r\n\r\nWe will provide fix for these issues in separate PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/497248722/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/497259939","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/1266#issuecomment-497259939","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/1266","id":497259939,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NzI1OTkzOQ==","user":{"login":"peedeeboy","id":44434629,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NDM0NjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44434629?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peedeeboy","html_url":"https://github.com/peedeeboy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peedeeboy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peedeeboy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peedeeboy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peedeeboy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peedeeboy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peedeeboy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peedeeboy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peedeeboy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peedeeboy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-30T09:02:29Z","updated_at":"2019-05-30T09:35:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the feedback @matthiasblaesing ! \r\n\r\nAway for a few days.

For startup / loading performance, I would still advice compiling images into something vector-ish without the overhead of XML parsing at *compile time*, having the loader look for that first, and if that fails, *then* fail over to parsing SVG.  That's not a blocker, as it could be added transparently later, but probably a good idea.  Parsing XML is not cheap, and since icons are loaded on demand, it's not going to be predictable what it slows down, but it will slow down something.\r\n\r\n2. In GraphicsNode, you probably want to use the rendering hints for the specific screen type, so SVG icons use subpixel antialiasing if the user's screen does (this should also be incorporated into CachedImageKey, since the value may be different on one monitor and another, e.g. RGB vs. BGR).  You can get the screen settings like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhintsMap = (Map<RenderingHints.Key, Object>)\r\n    (Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().getDesktopProperty(\"awt.font.desktophints\"));\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. I would go beyond in-memory caching, and actually use the IDE's cache dir to write out rasterized versions of the generated images, and attempt to load from there first - particularly if not doing any precompiling.  Just make the image size and other properties part of the path from your cache folder, e.g.  $CACHE_ROOT/svgimg/$WIDTH/$HEIGHT/$TEXT_AA/org/openide/resources/actions/redo.png - then let the original ImageUtilities raster image caching take care of it from there.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe way you'd do that \"compiling\" would be to load the SVG and paint it into something like this:  https://github.com/timboudreau/imagine/blob/master/Imagine/vector/src/main/java/net/java/dev/imagine/api/vector/painting/VectorWrapperGraphics.java - and then have a simple way to serialize the list of objects that represent paint operations to disk;  and load those at runtime.  Or perhaps Batik's internal representation could be used in some tighter, more lightweight serialized form (but I doubt it, and it would be nice, under normal circumstances, not to load Batik at all).\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/498695420/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/498707033","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/1215#issuecomment-498707033","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/1215","id":498707033,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5ODcwNzAzMw==","user":{"login":"lkishalmi","id":1381701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODE3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1381701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi","html_url":"https://github.com/lkishalmi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-04T14:54:06Z","updated_at":"2019-06-04T14:54:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Let's have this on the master.

Thank you so much for working on this, I've seen this brought up a couple of times so I'm sure quite a few people will be happy to see SASS support working again :)  Apologies I haven't got around to testing until now!\r\n\r\nI've tested on Windows with the dart-sass batch file, and with the .js implementation running through node.  Both worked ok including adding additional parameters via the Project properties.\r\n\r\n@matthiasblaesing Yes - this definitely makes things better and I think you are right to merge.   I was a bit apprehensive as I saw in the old bugzilla that these parameters had already been removed in the past, then re-added later (probably for the reasons I mention - there is an incomplete class specifically for libsass implementations). See here: https://netbeans.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=271126\r\n\r\nThere is still a bit of work to do in the long run, as the SassExecutable class was designed for Ruby SASS, some of the other methods such as checking version won't get the results they expect. \r\n\r\nThe only downside to this that I found in testing is that the Generate Sourcemaps flag in NB Options won't have any effect (due to the logic in the version check above not working with as expected with libsass implementations). \r\n\r\nHowever, this can be worked around by adding the `--no-source-map` parameter in the Project Properties, so I think it is probably more important to get @maxcuttins fix in for NB11.1 and we can open a new Jira ticket for the tidy up work?

Results:\r\n\r\nAverage size of SVG icon file is 2959 bytes (max was 5244 bytes)\r\nAverage size of PNG icon file is 363 bytes (max was 652 bytes)\r\nLoading and painting SVG took 2161.02 microseconds per icon +/- 4.49%\r\nLoading and painting PNG took 267.02 microseconds per icon +/- 15.87%\r\n\r\nSo loading an SVG image is about 8 times slower than loading a PNG. Though it's still only about 2 milliseconds per icon, so delays shouldn't be noticeable until we've redrawn at least 100 icons. Also note that for HiDPI screens, the PNG file will have to be loaded twice, one at the standard resolution, and one at twice the resolution (4x the number of pixels). In this scenario, I estimate that the PNG approach is only about 4x faster than the SVG approach.\r\n\r\nI kind of like the store-PNG-in-cache-dir approach--saves us from having to bundle generated PNG files. I'm more sceptical of the \"store as log of Graphics2D operations\"--that's a _lot_ of code and complexity for a small performance enhancement.

I dislike bloat, but remember a full NetBeans build is 1GB!\r\n\r\nIt would also make sense that when a 2nd equally good HiDPI icons solution arrives, *then* we take the time to invent a SPI and have both solutions implementat that SPI, etc.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, Eirik is free to do however he decides, I reviewed the patches, they looked OK to me.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/500139107/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/500182476","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/1278#issuecomment-500182476","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/1278","id":500182476,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMDE4MjQ3Ng==","user":{"login":"JaroslavTulach","id":26887752,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODg3NzUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26887752?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach","html_url":"https://github.com/JaroslavTulach","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-09T03:41:42Z","updated_at":"2019-06-09T03:41:42Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> There is nothing holy about the platform/lib folder? \r\n\r\nThere are three kinds of `ClassLoader` in NetBeans Runtime \r\n- `platform/lib` JARs are loaded by application classloader\r\n- `platform/core` JARs are loaded by enhanced NetBeans classloader, but fixed\r\n- `platform/modules` JARs are loaded by enhanced NetBeans classloader and fully dynamic\r\n\r\nTo benefit from enhanced classloading features like [compatibility patching](http://wiki.netbeans.org/BackwardCompatibilityPatches) or [fast startup](http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/CacheForModularity), then it is essential to avoid placing JARs into `platform/lib` (and/or `platform/core`) folder.\r\n\r\n> As a desktop platform, NetBeans Platform must support vectorial icons out of the box\r\n\r\nMaybe, if desktop is your only focus, but ...\r\n\r\n> I'm curious which apps use the platform and would use a modern Apache NetBeans Platform\r\n> version but wouldn't want to support HiDPI screens?\r\n\r\n... we are talking about  the [NetBeans Runtime Container](http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/NetBeans_Runtime_Container).
