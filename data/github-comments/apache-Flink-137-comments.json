Using `ScalarOperators.generateCast()` for casting BigDecimal to double can fix this problem. It can support BigDecimal for `power` in SQL. But if we support for `power`, we should also support BigDecimal for `log10`, `ln`, `exp`, etc. \n\nSo I there are 2 approaches:\n\n(1). Bind BuiltInMethods.POWER_DEC to the new created `power(double, BigDecimal)`, no other code involved. This will lose BigDecimal support for power and sqrt in SQL. Users can call an explicit cast.\n(2). Support BigDecimal for  `log`,`ln`,`exp` too. This can be done in a separate JIRA.\n\nI prefer approach (2). What do you think ? \ncc @fhueske @twalthr \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/257287972/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/257305305","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2439#issuecomment-257305305","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2439","id":257305305,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NzMwNTMwNQ==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-31T14:17:27Z","updated_at":"2016-10-31T14:17:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think this is getting into good shape, we can almost merge it.\nTwo things remaining:\n1.

for the update @kenmy. We are trying to keep the Java and Scala APIs as close as possible. Could you convert the Scala `FlinkHadoopEnvironment` into a `HadoopInputs` class as well?\n\nI also noticed that there are quite a few Hadoop-related tests in the `flink-tests` module. I think it would be good to move the tests from the `org.apache.flink.test.hadoop` and `org.apache.flink.api.scala.hadoop` packages of `flink-tests` to `flink-hadoop-compatibility`. \n\nIn fact, there might be a bit of overlap with other tests in `flink-hadoop-compatibility`. It would be great if you could check for tests with overlapping test coverage. Then we could drop some of these tests.\n\nThanks for your work,\nFabian\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/257330577/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/257330704","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2686#issuecomment-257330704","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2686","id":257330704,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NzMzMDcwNA==","user":{"login":"tonycox","id":15128562,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTI4NTYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15128562?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonycox","html_url":"https://github.com/tonycox","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonycox/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonycox/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonycox/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonycox/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonycox/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonycox/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonycox/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonycox/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonycox/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-31T15:46:26Z","updated_at":"2016-10-31T15:46:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@wuchong if choosing second option, why not to solve this issue https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-1468 instead of solve on flink side ?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/257330704/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/257344220","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2712#issuecomment-257344220","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2712","id":257344220,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NzM0NDIyMA==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-31T16:31:36Z","updated_at":"2016-10-31T16:31:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks good to me, except the name `ignoreUnmappedState` ;-)\nAs usual, the three most difficult things in computer science are (1) finding good names, and (2) off-by-one errors.\n\nWhat do you think about calling something like `allowUnresumedState` or `allowNonRestoredState`?

Can't you easily achieve the same by `val evaluateDS = labeledVectorDS.map(x => (x.vector, x.label))` and then using `evaluateDS` for the `evaluate` operation?\n\nIn general I think it would be better to write a generic `EvaluateDataSetOperation` which can take a `ValueExtractor` which can extract the value from the `Testing` type. Then we could offer a `ValueExtractor` for the `LabeledVector`. That way we could extend it easily for different types as well.\n\nA general remark: It's always helpful to write a PR description and format the title according to the contribution guidelines [1]. Furthermore, your code does not adhere to the existing code style. Even though Flink does not have a strict code style, it is always good to stick to the code style of the existing code.\n\n[1] http://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute.html\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/257930702/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/257931991","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2658#issuecomment-257931991","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2658","id":257931991,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NzkzMTk5MQ==","user":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-02T17:10:36Z","updated_at":"2016-11-02T17:10:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for your contribution @thvasilo.

I suppose that the comment that it does not work, implies that it does not work when rescaling right? Not in general. If I am right, then this is expected. As you can see I have not even changed the implementation of the snapshot/restore cycle, as we first have to figure out how to solve more important design issues of the sink. This is the reason why I also mention in the jira that this is just a first step.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/258168355/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/258176487","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2094#issuecomment-258176487","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2094","id":258176487,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1ODE3NjQ4Nw==","user":{"login":"mbalassi","id":5990983,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5OTA5ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5990983?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi","html_url":"https://github.com/mbalassi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-03T15:28:31Z","updated_at":"2016-11-03T15:28:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"As @fhueske and @StephanEwen has suggested I have refactored @ggevay's code and now instead of adding two methods to the `TypeInformation` I have moved the functionality to a `FieldAccessorFactory` class.\n\nTo achieve this I had to move the code back to `flink-streaming-java` as the static factory needs to import `scala.Product` to implement the functionality for case classes.

[Here's](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.2/dev/libs/ml/standard_scaler.html) a simple example for another pre-processing algorithm. I see you already have extensive ScalaDoc's we could prolly replicate those in the docs.\n- Have you tested it in a relatively large scale dataset? Ideally in a distributed setting where the input files are on HDFS. This way we test the scalability of the implementation, and problems usually arise.\n- Have you compared the output with a reference implementation? My knowledge of word2vec is not very deep but as far as I understand the output is non-deterministic, so we would need some sort of proxy to evaluate the integrated correctness of the implementation.\n- Finally I see this introduces a new nlp package. I'm not sure how to treat this (and relevant algorithms, say TF-IDF), as they are not necessarily NLP specific, even though they stem from the field you could treat any sequence of objects as a \"sentence\" and embed them. I would favor including them as pre-processing steps and hence inheriting from the `Transformer` interface, perhaps by having a feature pre-processing package.\n\nRegards,\nTheodore\n\nEDIT: Do you mind adding the [ml] tag to the PR title? It helps with filtering oustanding FlinkML PRs.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/258209011/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/258211079","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2684#issuecomment-258211079","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2684","id":258211079,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1ODIxMTA3OQ==","user":{"login":"thvasilo","id":9048995,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNDg5OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9048995?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo","html_url":"https://github.com/thvasilo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-03T17:17:33Z","updated_at":"2016-11-03T17:17:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hello @tillrohrmann I think you make some valid points.

The implementation worked well as the scale of the data increased - although I was experiencing some frustrating memory issues as I increased the number of iterations performed.\n- I can show that the vectors generated show good results along the lines of the original paper - that they show semantic similarity in line with cosine similarity and that difference vectors can be used to create 'analogy' relationships that make sense. But you're right that it's non-deterministic and surveying how it's tested in other libraries is inconclusive. I've included some toy datasets in the integration tests that show good results and exercise these qualities.\n- I know what you mean about the new package.

This combination is meaningless, of course. Maybe an error can be printed out and the graph generator stops compiling the graph if  `UNORDERED` mode and `Watermark` are enabled at the same time?\n\nBoth of these two modes are guaranteed by `AsyncWaitOperator`. While doing checkpoint for the chained operator and making the snapshot for the `AsyncWaitOperator`, it will first try to  get all elements in the  `AsyncCollectorBuffer` by calling `getStreamElementsInBuffer()`, which will try to get the lock first to block `Emitter` thread and set a flag named `isCheckpointing` to idle `Emitter` thread. So any finished `AsyncCollector` will not be transferred to the next operator. Calling the `snapshotState()` method is from the head operator to the tail operator, making sure that all states can be taken correctly since `Emitter` threads in parent operators have stopped working.\n\nI used to consider about using checkpoint lock in `Emitter` thread, but after testing with the case chaining multiple `AsyncWaitOperator` together, all `Emitter` thread can not fully utilize the the parallelism since they have to get the same lock while collecting outputs. One way to optimize this is to put a conditional statement at `performCheckpoint()`, if there is an `AsyncWaitOpeartor` in the chained operator, then it should broadcast barriers later after `checkpointState()`, otherwise, we can use original design.\n\nAt last, I will add more test cases based on the `OneInputStreamTaskTestHarness`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/258332087/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/258378715","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2094#issuecomment-258378715","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2094","id":258378715,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1ODM3ODcxNQ==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-04T09:15:25Z","updated_at":"2016-11-04T09:15:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the update @mbalassi.

The only thing which one has to do respect is that only those elements in the queue from the beginning to the first watermark element are allowed to be processed in an `UNORDERED` fashion. Only they have been emitted, the watermark can be emitted. After the watermark has been emitted, the next batch of stream records can be processed `UNORDERED`. An example:\n\nGiven `queue = s1, s2, s3, w1, s4, w2, s5, s6, w3` we can process `s1, s2` `s3` `UNORDERED`. After they have been emitted, `w1` has to be emitted. And only after the emission of `w1`, we can start emitting `s4`. After `w2` we can process `s5` and `s6` `UNORDERED`. And so on...\n\nConcerning the exactly once processing guarantees. The problem is the following with the current implementation. When you call `AsyncWaitOperator.snapshotState` it will call `AsyncCollectorBuffer.getStreamElementsInBuffer` which will block the `Emitter` thread. However, after `getStreamElementsInBuffer` has completed, the `Emitter` thread is again allowed to emit new elements, right? Thus, this can happen before the `StreamTask` has actually send the checkpoint barrier to downstream operators because it is not guarded by the checkpoint lock. So you might have an element `x1` contained in the checkpoint of the `AsyncWaitOperator` and in one of the downstream operators. That's the reason why you only have at-least once processing guarantees.\n\nI fear that the hand-tailored solution for the `AsyncWaitOperator` in the `StreamTask.performCheckpoint` method won't solve the problems with the exactly once processing guarantees because of the afore-mentioned problems. I don't see another way to solve the problem at the moment other than using the checkpoint lock. Have you measured the performance penalty for multiple chained `AsyncWaitOperators` when using the checkpoint lock?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/258382006/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/258383942","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2747#issuecomment-258383942","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2747","id":258383942,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1ODM4Mzk0Mg==","user":{"login":"kl0u","id":2405800,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDU4MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2405800?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u","html_url":"https://github.com/kl0u","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-04T09:40:52Z","updated_at":"2016-11-04T09:40:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @aljoscha .

After the checkpoint has completed, there won't be any other `StreamRecords`, `Watermarks` (because we haven't activated them) and `LatencyMarkers` coming on the input. This would imply that the pending elements in the `AsyncCollectorBuffer` will never be emitted, won't they?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/258407093/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/258408022","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2680#issuecomment-258408022","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2680","id":258408022,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1ODQwODAyMg==","user":{"login":"uce","id":1756620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTY2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1756620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce","html_url":"https://github.com/uce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-04T11:26:48Z","updated_at":"2016-11-04T11:26:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"OK, cool.
