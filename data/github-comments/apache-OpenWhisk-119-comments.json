job! Couple of thoughts:\r\n1) I wonder whether you have considered leveraging Marathon rather than Mesos directly? Obviously there might be non-technical reasons (e.g., marathon is not apache), but I am curious  whether technically it could make sense to take advantage of some of the nice properties that Marathon provides on top of Mesos (also comparing this to the k8s factory). \r\n2) Also, have you assessed the performance/scalability of the 'naive' implementation without pooling resource offers?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/369329528/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/369335995","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/3219#issuecomment-369335995","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/3219","id":369335995,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2OTMzNTk5NQ==","user":{"login":"glikson","id":1607861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDc4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1607861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glikson","html_url":"https://github.com/glikson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glikson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glikson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glikson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glikson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glikson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glikson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glikson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glikson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glikson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-28T18:29:48Z","updated_at":"2018-02-28T18:29:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"should

\r\n1. Marathon has a different notion of lifecycle for containers than openwhisk, so I don't think that using it is a good option; although it was discussed amongst my colleagues at Adobe. Generally marathon adds a layer of container durability, so that if a container stops it will be restarted indefinitely, but this is not really something openwhisk action containers do at all - they are started, and then explicitly stopped. \r\n2. I think it depends on what you mean exactly by \"pooling resource offers\" - do you mean \"holding resource offers\"? FWIW, we haven't thoroughly tested the mesos-actor library in a multi-framework deployment, but our deployment is multi-framework (marathon, kafka, and openwhisk), so we need the frameworks to be good citizens that don't agressively hold resources without using them. So that is where we start. It may be good to make this tunable for different envs, where if someone does NOT have other frameworks in play, they could turn up the retention of offers, or use dynamic reservations at startup to preemptively reserve resources - but using the prewarm containers in openwhisk will already accomplish this indirectly, so it hasn't been a priority to expose it at the framework level.

Ohhhh ofcourse. It's an array in PHP because PHP has associative arrays 🤦‍♂️. Good one!\r\n\r\nTo follow up on this for completeness, PHP's JSON decoder can decode to associative arrays (dictionaries) or to objects (PHP's stdClass). However, PHP's associative array handling is so strong that decoding JSON to associated arrays is more common and so that's what I made PHP Runtime do. \r\n\r\nAs this came up, I've doubled checked by looking at a few major PHP frameworks and they all decode JSON to associative arrays. I also asked a few PHP developers that I know about what they would expect JSON decoding to look like on the PHP side and they all confirmed that associative arrays is what they would expect rather than stdClass objects.\r\n\r\ni.e. we're doing it right for PHP, even though it's not necessarily what other languages would do.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/369869445/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/369878147","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/3363#issuecomment-369878147","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/3363","id":369878147,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2OTg3ODE0Nw==","user":{"login":"cbickel","id":13397688,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzk3Njg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13397688?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel","html_url":"https://github.com/cbickel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbickel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-02T10:02:11Z","updated_at":"2018-03-02T10:02:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks a lot for your contribution :)\r\nFrom my side, this PR looks good.
