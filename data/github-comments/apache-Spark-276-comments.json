Actually `bin/spark-sql` doesn't output lots of logs by default. Did you set something like `hive.root.looger=INFO,console` in your `hive-site.xml` or elsewhere (similar to what `shark-withinfo` does in Shark)?\n2. Hmm... I'm not very sure about this. Usually people just copy their `hive-site.xml` and `hive-log4j.properties` from their existing Hive installation. Maybe we can do it in another PR. One thing to note, [`hive-default.xml.template` in Hive 0.12 isn't a valid XML](https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/release-0.12.0/conf/hive-default.xml.template#L2000), needs some minor tweak before being added.\n3. Need some more time to investigate this one. We can discuss this offline.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51299909/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51300042","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1513#issuecomment-51300042","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1513","id":51300042,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMzAwMDQy","user":{"login":"scwf","id":7018048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMTgwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7018048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scwf","html_url":"https://github.com/scwf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scwf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scwf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scwf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scwf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scwf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scwf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scwf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scwf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scwf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-06T06:56:04Z","updated_at":"2014-08-06T06:56:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"it's becaude [SPARK-2260] update Command.scala, i will fix it\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51300042/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51300053","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1799#issuecomment-51300053","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1799","id":51300053,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMzAwMDUz","user":{"login":"mateiz","id":228859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODg1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz","html_url":"https://github.com/mateiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-06T06:56:15Z","updated_at":"2014-08-06T06:56:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"test this please\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51300053/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51300244","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1799#issuecomment-51300244","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1799","id":51300244,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMzAwMjQ0","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-06T06:59:30Z","updated_at":"2014-08-06T06:59:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA tests have started for PR 1799.

the problem is that the dependency is already there. Spark core uses Zookeeper classes directly in `SparkCuratorUtil`. If you remove Curator, the code no longer compiles. Now, granted, if you removed Curator, you'd be removing this class too. So it's kind of OK to let the transitive dependency happen in practice in Spark Core. \n\nHowever, it is not pulling in the version declared in `zookeeper.version` (necessarily). In fact, that property is not used at all.\n\nIt exists I think for the benefit of vendors who are building the whole thing for a system that uses a particular zookeeper version, as evidenced by its presence in the MapR build. I think the intent is to control the version Curator depends on. So I think there is an intent for Core to depend directly on ZK for this reason?\n\nI wouldn't agree that letting the transitive dependency happen to cover this is a good idea for the Kafka test though. There, it uses Zookeeper independently of Curator. It's a test dependency too so doesn't affect the non-test artifacts.\n\nIt would be more correct/robust to simply express the dependency on zookeeper in this case. I'll open a PR that shows what that looks like.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51303742/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51303827","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1801#issuecomment-51303827","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1801","id":51303827,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMzAzODI3","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-06T07:51:09Z","updated_at":"2014-08-06T07:51:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA

for text feature extraction counts you'd want only positive values \n(scikit-learn has a non-negative flag: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.FeatureHasher.html#sklearn.feature_extraction.FeatureHasher)\n\nNot suggesting any change of `HashingTF` now - just considering the more general use cases this opens up (ie VW-style hashing, including namespaces etc).\n\nThis can be revisited perhaps for 1.2+ - the default could be as is (non-negative features), with an option to use the signed approach. `HashingTF` then becomes a more general-use feature hasher (name could change, or depending on how `HashingTF` evolves it could become a `HashingVectorizer`-like thing)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51380681/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51380803","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1744#issuecomment-51380803","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1744","id":51380803,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMzgwODAz","user":{"login":"nchammas","id":1039369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzkzNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1039369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas","html_url":"https://github.com/nchammas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-06T19:01:12Z","updated_at":"2014-08-06T19:01:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've
