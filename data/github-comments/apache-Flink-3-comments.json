one!\nI'd prefer to use a ReduceFunction instead of a GroupReduceFunction because it is automatically combinable (which is usually important if you do a Reduce without groupBy) and shorter.\nHowever, you would need to add another MapFunction for the final division.\n\nYou could also replace the first MapFunction by a FilterFunction and emit only a record if the test is passed. This would mean that no records with 0-valued ints are emitted and therefore the summing becomes cheaper.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/50073451/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/50126545","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/78#issuecomment-50126545","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/78","id":50126545,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMTI2NTQ1","user":{"login":"mariemayadi","id":5619024,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MTkwMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5619024?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariemayadi","html_url":"https://github.com/mariemayadi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariemayadi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariemayadi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariemayadi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariemayadi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariemayadi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariemayadi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariemayadi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariemayadi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariemayadi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-25T09:18:35Z","updated_at":"2014-07-25T09:18:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I really like the filter suggestion.

you everyone for the terrific feedback. Lambda detection is changed to use SerializedLambda as Stephan suggested (that was grant!).\n\nIn terms of naming, I do like Mapper, Reducer, FlatMapper, and CoGrouper. The problematic ones are \"Filterer\", \"Joiner\", \"Crosser\", and \"FlatJoiner\". We can live with those, or call them simply \"Filter\", \"Join\", etc, thus having an inconsistent naming scheme (we should probably not use the name \"Map\" as it would cause frequent conflicts with Java Maps). \n\nA previous thought was MapFunctional, ReduceFunctional, etc, referring to functional interfaces. Any thoughts on this?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/50726582/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/50731057","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/85#issuecomment-50731057","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/85","id":50731057,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNzMxMDU3","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-31T08:25:36Z","updated_at":"2014-07-31T08:25:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I don't find Joiner, Crosser, and FlatJoiner too bad.

If not all the header lines are in the first split, it will not work - worse, the behavior changes with the DOP.\n\nOne line is safe, because it is always in the first split, but any successive one is not safe.\n\nOnly sure way to do this for more than one line is run code on the master and modify the splits.\n\nThere is a hook for something like that in the FileOutputFormat: The `InitializeOnMaster` interface. We can make sure such a hook exists for input formats as well.\n\nBTW: When do you ever have more than one header line?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/52231599/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/52232837","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/71#issuecomment-52232837","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/71","id":52232837,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMjMyODM3","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-14T19:39:28Z","updated_at":"2014-08-14T19:39:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks good to me.\n\n@warneke Have you tested it with a MapR file system?
