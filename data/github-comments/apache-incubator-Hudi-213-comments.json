@guanziyue thank you for taking the time to troubleshoot this concurrency issues and implement the fix!\r\n> \r\n> I echo @vinothchandar concerns and i think we're taking a step a bit too far -- `ParquetWriter` is not assumed to be thread-safe, neither do i believe we should make it such.\r\n> \r\n> Instead, i believe we should just resolve the problem with its concurrent access (which you already did) and make sure we make it clear that `ParquetWriter` is not thread-safe so its usage need to be properly guarded externally.\r\n\r\nHi @alexeykudinkin, may I know if your concern is \"adding a lock to parquetWriter\" or \"adding a lock to hot path\"? I'm afraid that it is difficult to come up with a method to guarantee this problem is totally solved except adding a signal to hot path. Producer need to check if current thread is interrupted and response to it in a reasonable time or consumer need to immediately reject any writing just after close method is called, which also need a lock on hot path. For producer solution, we can have a lock-free check. For consumer, we may use volatile rather than a lock? But either of them is adding something to hot path.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1064821297/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1064849682","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/4969#issuecomment-1064849682","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/4969","id":1064849682,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM4_eFES","user":{"login":"wangxianghu","id":49835526,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5ODM1NTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49835526?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu","html_url":"https://github.com/wangxianghu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-11T07:32:40Z","updated_at":"2022-03-11T07:36:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"hi @nsivabalan  can we add this processor ? it is very useful in scenarios with diversified data requirements.\r\nIn our comany, we have use this feature to add multiple processors to our pipeline:\r\n1. maxwell post processor : extract data from maxwell json string. this is a standard processor\r\n2.

The master branch just changed soon after my last rebase operation. \r\nAll in all, this PR initially want to solve the concurrent use of mergeHandle which is equivalent to using parquet writer concurrently. I applied two changes before. \r\n1. Add a graceful exit for BoundedInMemoryExecutor + change the order of method call in SparkMergeHelper.\r\n    Cons: a. will add a check of thread status on hot path.  b. Any other future use of Parquet writer may have risk to suffer same problem.\r\n2. Add a lock in ParquetWriter.\r\n    Pros: reduce the risk of misuse in the future.\r\n    Cons: add a lock on hot path which may influence perf. (I did a simple profiling. It is hard to observe a negative impact actually)\r\nEither one can totally solve this problem. But both of them may have drawback.\r\nAnd I will focus on this problem and make rename of executor another PR if needed.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1065290731/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1065321854","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/4962#issuecomment-1065321854","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/4962","id":1065321854,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM4_f4V-","user":{"login":"yihua","id":2497195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTcxOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2497195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua","html_url":"https://github.com/yihua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-11T17:21:34Z","updated_at":"2022-03-11T17:21:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> @yihua if you have free time， could you pls help review this pr， thanks\r\n\r\nI'll review it today.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1065321854/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1065477568","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/5015#issuecomment-1065477568","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/5015","id":1065477568,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM4_geXA","user":{"login":"hudi-bot","id":79415918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDE1OTE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79415918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/hudi-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-11T20:15:27Z","updated_at":"2022-03-11T20:15:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\nMeta data\n{\n  \"version\" : 1,\n  \"metaDataEntries\" : [ {\n    \"hash\" : \"16c497f48a922830b3fbcb833bca203c292158da\",\n    \"status\" : \"DELETED\",\n    \"url\" : \"https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=6818\",\n    \"triggerID\" : \"16c497f48a922830b3fbcb833bca203c292158da\",\n    \"triggerType\" : \"PUSH\"\n  }, {\n    \"hash\" : \"4b26887037e9d07801fc95b1040ec5ca8498bd17\",\n    \"status\" : \"SUCCESS\",\n    \"url\" : \"https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=6846\",\n    \"triggerID\" : \"4b26887037e9d07801fc95b1040ec5ca8498bd17\",\n    \"triggerType\" : \"PUSH\"\n  } ]\n}-->\n## CI report:\n\n* 4b26887037e9d07801fc95b1040ec5ca8498bd17 Azure: [SUCCESS](https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=6846) \n\n<details>\n<summary>Bot commands</summary>\n  @hudi-bot supports the following commands:\n\n -

Those two are totally different and it could be problematic if we use the hive and impala for the same table. \r\nWould you try this, create an external impala table pointing to the hudi hdfs path, run impala query to recover partitions and refresh table.
