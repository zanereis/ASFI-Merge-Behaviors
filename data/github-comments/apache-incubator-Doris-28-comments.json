User can't query the `sequence_column` hidden in table ,  but can add one column which value is equal to `sequence_column`.  like this\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE `test_2` (\r\n`pin_id` bigint(20) NOT NULL COMMENT \"\",\r\n`date` date NOT NULL COMMENT \"\",\r\n`group_id` bigint(20) NOT NULL COMMENT \"\",\r\n`sequence_visiable` int NOT NULL,\r\n`keyword` varchar(128)  NOT NULL\r\n) ENGINE=OLAP\r\nUNIQUE KEY(`pin_id`, `date`, `group_id`)\r\nPROPERTIES (\r\n\"function_column.sequence_type\" = \"int\"\r\n);\r\n```\r\nColumn names are not necessarily \"sequence_visiable\", this is just an example. The user ensures that the values are same by specifying parameters at LOAD time\r\n\r\n## LOAD\r\n### Stream Load\r\n`curl --location-trusted -u root -H \"columns: pin_id,date,group_id,source_sequence,keyword\"  -H \"function_column.sequence_col: source_sequence\" -T test_load  http://127.0.01:8030/api/test/test_1/_stream_load`\r\n\r\n### Broker Load\r\n```\r\nLOAD LABEL test.test11\r\n(\r\n    DATA INFILE(\"hdfs://path/to/load_file\")\r\n    INTO TABLE `test_1`\r\n    FORMAT AS \"parquet\"\r\n    (pin_id,date,group_id,source_sequence,keyword)\r\n    ORDER BY source_sequence\r\n) with BROKER broker_name (...)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Routine Load\r\n```\r\nCREATE ROUTINE LOAD test_1_job ON test_1\r\nCOLUMNS TERMINATED BY \",\",\r\n(pin_id,date,group_id,source_sequence,keyword)\r\nORDER BY source_sequence\r\nPROPERTIES\r\n(\r\n    \"desired_concurrent_number\"=\"3\",\r\n    \"max_batch_interval\" = \"30\",\r\n    \"max_batch_rows\" = \"1000000\",\r\n    \"max_batch_size\" = \"509715200\"\r\n) FROM KAFKA\r\n(\r\n    \"kafka_broker_list\" = \"...\",\r\n    \"kafka_topic\" = \"...\",\r\n    \"property.client.id\" = \"...\",\r\n    \"property.group.id\" = \"...\"\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI added a parameter `sequence_col` to identify the source data for the sequence column at load,  because it's hidden column, user need to identify the source column in `columns_mapping`. \r\n\r\nFor table `test_2` which has column `sequence_visiable`, user can set \"sequence_col\" = \"sequence_visiable\" at properties,  which means the hidden column \"sequence_col\" is same with the \"sequence_visiable\" in table, user can query the the column \"sequence_visiable\" instead of \"sequence_col\"","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/654853902/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/654919279","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/issues/3930#issuecomment-654919279","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/3930","id":654919279,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1NDkxOTI3OQ==","user":{"login":"morningman","id":2899462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTk0NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2899462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman","html_url":"https://github.com/morningman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-07T14:52:32Z","updated_at":"2020-07-07T14:52:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"If

<center>Doris 支持批量删除设计文档</center>\r\n\r\n## 背景\r\n\r\n​\t\t目前Doris 支持broker load， routine load， stream load 等多种导入方式，对于数据的删除目前只能通过delete 语句进行删除，使用delete 语句的方式删除时，每执行一次delete 都会生成一个新的数据版本，如果频繁删除会严重影响查询性能，并且在使用delete 方式删除时，是通过生成一个空的rowset来记录删除条件实现，每次读取都要对删除跳条件进行过滤，同样在条件较多时会对性能造成影响。对比其他的系统，greenplum 的实现方式更像是传统数据库产品，snowflake 通过merge 语法实现。\r\n\r\n​\t\t对于类似于cdc 数据的导入的场景，数据数据中insert 和delete 一般是穿插出现的，面对这种场景我们目前的导入方式也无法满足，即使我们能够分离出insert 和delete 虽然可以解决导入的问题，但是仍然解决不了删除的问题。\r\n\r\n## 设计目标\r\n\r\n### 功能层面：\r\n\r\n增强导入功能，使其能够支持如下场景：\r\n\r\n* ~~单纯的批量导入，目前已经支持~~\r\n* 批量点删除\r\n* 导入和删除混合的数据导入\r\n* 只支持unique_keys 表\r\n\r\n### 易用性方面：\r\n\r\n尽量减少对导入语法的修改，并且能够兼容目前的导入语法 \r\n\r\n### 性能方面\r\n\r\n导入和读取的性能要和目前的导入方式基本持平，不能有太大的性能损失\r\n\r\n## 详细设计\r\n\r\n导入语法方面为在导入是增加一列标示当前行是导入还是删除，如果没有默认所有行为插入行，实现层面本次升级的功能只在segmentV2上实现，v1 暂不考虑，在segment 文件的`IndexRegion` 中增加一个类似于null bitmap 的bitmap 索引用于标示需要删除的行。\r\n\r\n### 数据结构设计\r\n\r\n需要在segment 结构中增加一个bitmap 索引(delete_index_page)来标示哪一行被标记为删除，PagePointerPB 结构和之前定义的相同，使用bitmap 作为索引。\r\n\r\n```\r\nmessage SegmentFooterPB {\r\n    optional uint32 version = 1 [default = 1]; // file version\r\n    repeated ColumnMetaPB columns = 2; // tablet schema\r\n    optional uint32 num_rows = 3; // number of values\r\n    optional uint64 index_footprint = 4; // total idnex footprint of all columns\r\n    optional uint64 data_footprint = 5; // total data footprint of all columns\r\n    optional uint64 raw_data_footprint = 6; // raw data footprint\r\n\r\n    optional CompressionTypePB compress_type = 7 [default = LZ4F]; // default compression type for file columns\r\n    repeated MetadataPairPB file_meta_datas = 8; // meta data of file\r\n\r\n    // Short key index's page\r\n    optional PagePointerPB short_key_index_page = 9;、\r\n    // Use bitmap index to indicate which row is marked for deleting\r\n    optional PagePointerPB delete_index_page = 10;\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 导入语法\r\n\r\n导入的语法设计方面主要是增加一个指定删除标记列的字段的column 映射，并且需要在导入数据中增加这一列，各个导入方式设置的方法如下\r\n\r\n#### stream load\r\n\r\nstream load 的写法在在header 中的 columns  字段增加一个设置删除标记列的字段， 示例\r\n` -H \"columns: k1, k2, label_c3\" -H \"merge_type: [MERGE|APPEND|DELETE]\" -H \"delete: label_c3=1\"`\r\n\r\n#### broker load\r\n\r\n在`PROPERTIES ` 处设置删除标记列的字段\r\n\r\n```\r\nLOAD LABEL db1.label1\r\n(\r\n    [MERGE|APPEND|DELETE] DATA INFILE(\"hdfs://abc.com:8888/user/palo/test/ml/file1\")\r\n    INTO TABLE tbl1\r\n    COLUMNS TERMINATED BY \",\"\r\n    (tmp_c1,tmp_c2, label_c3)\r\n    SET\r\n    (\r\n        id=tmp_c2,\r\n        name=tmp_c1,\r\n    )\r\n    [DELETE ON label=true]\r\n\r\n)\r\nWITH BROKER 'broker'\r\n(\r\n    \"username\"=\"user\",\r\n    \"password\"=\"pass\"\r\n)\r\nPROPERTIES\r\n(\r\n    \"timeout\" = \"3600\"\r\n    \r\n);\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### reoutine load\r\n\r\nroutine load 在`columns` 字段增加映射 映射方式同上，示例如下\r\n\r\n```\r\n   CREATE ROUTINE LOAD example_db.test1 ON example_tbl \r\n    [WITH MERGE|APPEND|DELETE]\r\n    COLUMNS(k1, k2, k3, v1, v2, label),\r\n    WHERE k1 > 100 and k2 like \"%doris%\"\r\n    [DELETE ON label=true]\r\n    PROPERTIES\r\n    (\r\n        \"desired_concurrent_number\"=\"3\",\r\n        \"max_batch_interval\" = \"20\",\r\n        \"max_batch_rows\" = \"300000\",\r\n        \"max_batch_size\" = \"209715200\",\r\n        \"strict_mode\" = \"false\"\r\n    )\r\n    FROM KAFKA\r\n    (\r\n        \"kafka_broker_list\" = \"broker1:9092,broker2:9092,broker3:9092\",\r\n        \"kafka_topic\" = \"my_topic\",\r\n        \"kafka_partitions\" = \"0,1,2,3\",\r\n        \"kafka_offsets\" = \"101,0,0,200\"\r\n    );\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 导入\r\n\r\n数据导入时流程如下：\r\n\r\n当导入数据包含 删除标记 并且删除标记是true 时写入数据的同时记录次行在segment 中的行号，并记录在delete index 中，否则直接写数据，这里可以有一个优化就是当标记为删除时这一行的value 列可以都设置成相应类型的最空间占用最小的值， 比如varchar 类型我们可以把值都设置成空字符串以节省空间。\r\n\r\n```flow\r\nst=>start: Start Load\r\nflag_cond=>condition: delete flag is true\r\nwrite_rowdata=>operation: write data \r\nwrite_rowdata_opt=>operation: write Data with minimum values\r\nwrite_delete_index=>operation: write delete index\r\ne=>end\r\n\r\nst->flag_cond\r\nflag_cond(yes)->write_rowdata_opt->write_delete_index->e\r\nflag_cond(no)->write_rowdata->e\r\n```\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9098473/86886470-8fe21600-c129-11ea-93f5-f2ce692572c1.png)\r\n\r\n假设有表\r\n\r\n```\r\n+-------+-------------+------+-------+---------+---------+\r\n| Field | Type        | Null | Key   | Default | Extra   |\r\n+-------+-------------+------+-------+---------+---------+\r\n| k1    | INT         | Yes  | true  | 0       |         |\r\n| k2    | SMALLINT    | Yes  | true  | NULL    |         |\r\n| k3    | VARCHAR(32) | Yes  | true  |         |         |\r\n| v1    | BIGINT      | Yes  | false | 0       | REPLACE |\r\n+-------+-------------+------+-------+---------+---------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n导入数据为\r\n\r\n```\r\n0,1,foo,3,false\r\n0,1,foo,2,true\r\n1,2,bar,3,true\r\n0,1,foo,5,false\r\n```\r\n如果为UNIQUE_KEYS ，只记录最新的结果即可，因此第一行和第二行都没有意义，在导入聚合时会被忽略。则记录到rowset 中数据区的数据为\r\n\r\n```\r\n1,2,bar,3\r\n0,1,foo,5\r\n```\r\n\r\ndelete_index 为bitmap 中记录[1,0]， 标示这批导入数据中第1行被标记为删除。\r\n\r\n### 读取\r\n\r\n#### UNIQUE_KEYS表\r\n\r\n目前UNIQUE_KEYS 表读取时已经是从高版本向地板版本合并数据，由于unique_keys能保证每个segement中只有一条记录，只需读取第一个版本即可，如果是标记删除的则全部跳过，否则直接返回第一行，剩余跳过。\r\n\r\n### Compaction\r\n\r\ncompaction时 cumulative compaction和 base compaction 的功能方式有所不同cumulative compaction需要保存delete index，base compaction结束后可以删除delete index。\r\n\r\n#### Cumulative Compaction\r\n\r\ncumulative compaction 是从低版本向高版本合并，类似于读取的操作，但是需要遇到删除的行需要读取出来合并并且还需要添加到新的delete index 中。由于delete index 是一个bitmap索引，存在于每个segment 文件中，\r\n\r\n#### Base Compaction\r\n\r\nbase compaction 也是和读取类似的操作，但是因为是全量读取因此不需要记录delete index，直接把数据读取出来过滤掉要删除的行按之前compaction 逻辑处理即可。\r\n\r\n# 详细流程\r\n\r\n## 方案一\r\n\r\n### FE端\r\n\r\n在导入是通过fe 在导入的数据生成tuple 中增加了一列`__DORIS_BATCH_DELETE_COL__`，这一列的表达式就是删除条件，这一列的值就是delete 条件的结果，这样这列就会在broker scannode的中 自动计算出来并返回\r\n\r\n### BE 端\r\n\r\n1. 在be 的 tablet writer 中通过fe发过来的参数判断是否存在delete列来初始化 memtable\r\n\r\n2. 在tuple 被插入memtable 时将删除属性带入，在memtable merge 时对这个属性处理类似于 replace聚合, 这里修改 `ContiguousRow`增加一个属性`_is_delete`\r\n3. 在memtable 将内容刷入segment 文件时 将delete 信息写入segment footer 中的一个类似索引结构中，这里只记录需要删除的行的行号\r\n4. 在读取是将这个索引信息由segemt iterator 带入读出 传入 `RowBlock` 最终写入`RowCursor`中（`RowCursor` 也需要增加相应的delete 属性），之后就是在reader.cpp处理删除逻辑\r\n\r\n## 方案二\r\n\r\n方案二主要工作在fe端， 通过增加一个隐藏列`__DELETE_SIGN__`实现，因为我们只是在unique 模型上做批量删除，因此只需要增加一个 类型为bool 聚合函数为replace 的隐藏列即可。在be 各种聚合写入流程都和正常列一样，读取方案有两个：\r\n\r\n1. 在fe遇到 * 等扩展时去去掉`__DELETE_SIGN__`，并且默认加上 `__DELETE_SIGN__` != true 的条件\r\n2. be 读取时都会加上一列进行判断，通过条件确定是否删除\r\n\r\nbase compaction 时将标记删除的行去掉\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# 折衷考虑\r\n\r\n在上面的实现在FE端给broker 读出的数据生成了一个隐藏列，而在对应实际数据存储时没有在最终数据上也是用隐藏列 主要考虑如下：\r\n\r\n1. 如果在doris 里增加隐藏列比如需要更改表的结构，这样就会出现需要新建表才能使用，旧表需要schem change 后在能用，这样对用户不是很友好，对于用户数据的修改处于谨慎考虑不宜自动做schema change；\r\n2. 增加隐藏列后对于查询、删除设计列名的操作都需要过滤隐藏列的情况，在be 层除了存储层在segment 层面不感知这一列的存在其他层面都需要感知，改动处仍然比较多。\r\n3. 如果我们不在fe 建表时增加隐藏列 仅在be 增加，则会在构建 memtable 时需要修改biao 的tablet_schema 中的列信息，这里会涉及许多tupleid 和slot ID， 这些id 均由FE 生成，在be 修改增加因为没有全局信息有较大的风险可能会重复或者冲突，而且这些结构的代码大多没有提供修改和增加列的接口，修改成本也比较大。\r\n\r\n两种实现方案的却别就在于，隐藏列的方式除了segment 层不感知以外 FE， 计算， 除了segment以外的存储层其他部分都需要感知，而通过删除标记 只有存储层感知，其他层均不感知这种变化。从开发时间和复杂度角度来看目前采用删除标记的方案比较好，而且就只功能而言使用隐藏列和删除标记并没有性能上的区别。\r\n\r\n但是就更广泛的层面考虑doris 也应该支持隐藏列功能，个人觉得这一功能可以单独作为一个功能点单独开发（如果咋doris 已经支持隐藏列的情况下，批量删除功能则应使用隐藏列实现）这样也有利于以后的功能扩展（比如事物的支持）。\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/655317768/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/655332494","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/issues/4051#issuecomment-655332494","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/4051","id":655332494,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1NTMzMjQ5NA==","user":{"login":"morningman","id":2899462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTk0NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2899462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman","html_url":"https://github.com/morningman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-08T07:09:14Z","updated_at":"2020-07-08T07:09:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The
