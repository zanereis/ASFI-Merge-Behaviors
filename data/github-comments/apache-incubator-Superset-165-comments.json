I have updated the description above to describe the logic. In short this PR forces quotes around column aliases using native SQLAlchemy constructs for affected databases, which aligns the column names in the query and result. I was able to contain all oracle-like logic within `db_engine_specs.py` and `connectors/sqla/models.py`, i.e. there is no longer any need for dataframe column renaming downstream e.g. `viz.py`.\r\n\r\nFYI @HectorLira @minh5 @mmuru: This PR attempts (yet again) to improve stability for Redshift, Oracle, Snowflake (beware, you must use `snowflake-sqlalchemy==1.1.0`). Any testing help to verify whether or not it works would be valuable, especially Redhshift, as this was mainly validated against Snowflake during development.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/416031841/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/416041550","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/5679#issuecomment-416041550","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/5679","id":416041550,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNjA0MTU1MA==","user":{"login":"yamyamyuo","id":8351385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNTEzODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8351385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yamyamyuo","html_url":"https://github.com/yamyamyuo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yamyamyuo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yamyamyuo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yamyamyuo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yamyamyuo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yamyamyuo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yamyamyuo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yamyamyuo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yamyamyuo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yamyamyuo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-26T14:09:05Z","updated_at":"2018-08-26T14:09:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"#5566 do you mean the metric order problems?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/416041550/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/416041924","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/5656#issuecomment-416041924","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/5656","id":416041924,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNjA0MTkyNA==","user":{"login":"yamyamyuo","id":8351385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNTEzODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8351385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yamyamyuo","html_url":"https://github.com/yamyamyuo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yamyamyuo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yamyamyuo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yamyamyuo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yamyamyuo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yamyamyuo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yamyamyuo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yamyamyuo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yamyamyuo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yamyamyuo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-26T14:14:23Z","updated_at":"2018-08-26T14:14:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I have  wrote the tutorial to use AUTH_REMOTE_USER. https://github.com/yamyamyuo/superset-development.

I am not sure we want to expose too many libraries in the sandbox. One thing to consider is it also adds a constraint for us when upgrading or switching library because there is no easy way to check if this will break these js code in sandbox.
