Perhaps its easy to relabel some fields on the form. Personally I think using the username & password is a good idea, because at least then the secret can use the fernet encryption in the meta DB and not be visible in the UI.\r\n\r\nGenerally with boto/boto3 and other aws sdk's there is a hierarchy of places to retrieve credentials. First check if they are provided as arguments, then check environment variables, then check config file and then fall back to IAM role. I personally use IAM role here because it's the easiest to provision and maintain, and is transparent to the application. The airflow documentation for s3 connection should recommend IAM, assuming the server is in an AWS VPC. IAM is magic.\r\n\r\nFor this solution, I would recommend following a similar fallback, i.e. use the username & password field, otherwise fall back to the \"extra params\" field, otherwise let boto do the remaining fallback options and bubble up any exceptions.\r\n\r\nI've personally been hacking at the s3hook and saved it as a plugin in my environment because I am running server side encryption (kms) on my s3 buckets and a policy enforcing use of encryption, and the existing s3hook doesn't cater to that. I have it working well, but given current hook uses original boto, and this PR is pending there's no point in me making a PR for this yet.\r\n\r\nI've exposed the \"headers\" parameter of the load_files method which will accept a dict of extra API headers. My approach to this is to let de_json pop all the expected extra params (region, key etc) and then whatever is left throw into the \"headers\". Specifically I am looking at the 3 that start with \"x-amz-server-side-encryption\" but theres a whole bunch of possible headers you can send with s3 requests e.g. custom metadata. Hopefully this PR will accommodate that, if not I will wait till it gets merged and look at submitting a change after that.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/335401939/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/335414150","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2673#issuecomment-335414150","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2673","id":335414150,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNTQxNDE1MA==","user":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-10T09:23:35Z","updated_at":"2017-10-10T09:23:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 Let the tests pass on Windows","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/335414150/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/335415618","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2673#issuecomment-335415618","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2673","id":335415618,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNTQxNTYxOA==","user":{"login":"NielsZeilemaker","id":3777585,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3Nzc1ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3777585?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NielsZeilemaker","html_url":"https://github.com/NielsZeilemaker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NielsZeilemaker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NielsZeilemaker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NielsZeilemaker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NielsZeilemaker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NielsZeilemaker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NielsZeilemaker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NielsZeilemaker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NielsZeilemaker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NielsZeilemaker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-10T09:28:55Z","updated_at":"2017-10-10T09:28:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Not really, as the unit-tests don't run on windows.

Where it ends up pulling personal or work creds from my home directory when I want the other one.  I like the idea of falling back from args to environment variables as long as the fallbacks are explicit and documented.  The fallback to AWS creds in the home directory has been confusing to me though. \r\n\r\nWe currently use a forked version of S3Hook that pulls the access key and secret from login and password as well as discussed above.  That said, I modified it to fall back to login / password and still use extras first to maintain backwards compatibility.  Personally I think we should strive for the same here, but I could see the argument for best practices replacing the backwards compatible version.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/335501985/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/335539916","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2553#issuecomment-335539916","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2553","id":335539916,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNTUzOTkxNg==","user":{"login":"moe-nadal-ck","id":28959205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTU5MjA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28959205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck","html_url":"https://github.com/moe-nadal-ck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-10T16:58:33Z","updated_at":"2017-10-10T16:58:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Just rebased another time to stay sync with master, and removed the change in salesforce_hook (line removing) as it was only noise.

Thanks for the link.\r\n\r\n@mrkm4ntr @criccomini \r\nI like the ability to parse connection details from URI, it unfortunately breaks when scheme contains '_'. Instead of making every connection field accept cmd args (as in #2525), shall we just make conn-type overwritable? My concern is that It might be confusing when conn details can be set in multiple ways. I can also revise my PR to take conn_type only when scheme is None.
