I was experiencing the problem and the topology could not write out any profile measurements. \r\n\r\nI updated the Profiler lib with these changes and restarted the topology.  After the restart, I was able to successfully write out measurements to HBase. I also ensured that the `ProfileBuilderBolt` and `HBaseBolt` were running on different workers during this test.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/416998873/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/417015392","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1178#issuecomment-417015392","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1178","id":417015392,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNzAxNTM5Mg==","user":{"login":"JonZeolla","id":1385510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODU1MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1385510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla","html_url":"https://github.com/JonZeolla","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-29T16:24:20Z","updated_at":"2018-08-29T16:24:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Yeah that would explain why I wasn't hitting it in full-dev, but I did hit it in my test deployment.

While this is in the spec/RFC and sent on the network, it is standard practice to not write this to disk, but instead it is used by syslog software to choose which file to write it to, and strip it before writing to disk so the first component of the log is the date/timestamp.  Situations where syslog is pulled from disk and sent into Metron will all fail with a syntax error.  I would suggest that you work with the upstream lib (yourself) to make the PRI field optional =)\r\n\r\nSome evidence of my claims:\r\n * rsyslog documentation explaining that PRI fields are sent but not recorded [here](https://www.rsyslog.com/doc/v8-stable/tutorials/recording_pri.html).\r\n * The rsyslog built-in templates for writing to disk exclude PRI ([details](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/6/html/deployment_guide/s2-templates#brid-template-examples)).  Note that they are retained in some cases, but in situations such as forwarding to another syslog server or in the still-draft ietf-syslog-protocol-23 format.\r\n * Even legacy file formats only include PRI when forwarding ([details](https://rsyslog-doc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration/templates.html#legacy-string-based-template-samples)).\r\n * [Back in 2010](https://serverfault.com/questions/110678/syslog-ng-how-to-log-severity-facility) the SUSE syslog-ng format defaults to writing without

They get stability, while the new feature release code line proceeds as fast as the community wishes.\r\n>\r\n> When needed, and with community discussion, create a Maintenance Branch for the previous Metron release by incrementing the *third* digit of the previous release like so 0.[FR].[*MR++*].  All patches to the previous Metron release will be checked in under the MR branch and where it makes sense also under the master branch.  All new features will be checked in under the master branch.\r\n\r\nMaybe we can address at least the majority of cases for both of these by adding an option for a commit/branch to use as the basis of the RC?

The script changed around a lot, but is largely relocating + making input easier/more valid.  Couple bit and pieces here and there left to do, but it will currently produce separate repos which artifacts as expected, but not push them.\r\n\r\nMade some changes to make life easier.\r\n- It's more like some of the other scripts, in that it prompts you for info rather than requiring a bunch of flags.  Might be worth putting the flags back in case we want to script this into Maven or something?  I thought it made it a bit clearer what was happening during testing\r\n- More input validation. E.g. version is x.y.z., signing key is reasonably constructed, etc.\r\n\r\nOutstanding questions\r\n- What do we do about the KEYS file? Right now it lives entirely in the Metron repo, It'd be a rare issue, but things could be weird under the following circumstances.\r\n    1. There's a new release manager without their key in the KEYS file\r\n    2. We're releasing the Bro plugin before Metron.\r\n\r\nShould this repo have it's own KEYS file? Pull it from the Metron repo? Ignore/document the problem since it's presumably rare? <Other ideas here>?\r\n\r\nMisc\r\n- The pushes are currently commented out. Yes, there's practice run mode, but I was not going to even slightly depend on that during a refactoring while a release was going on.\r\n- Nope, this isn't handling non-master branches.
