I would expect Jakarta 9 to change and they might (or even have?) decide to change packages, so will this impact us?\r\n> \r\n\r\n\r\nYou are right about this, JakartaEE 9 change the packages names from javax to jakarta:\r\n- [Jakarta EE 9 API Docs](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/platform/9/apidocs/)\r\n- [Jakarta EE 8 API Docs](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/platform/8/apidocs/)\r\n\r\nThis is the [Backwards Compatibility](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jakartaee-platform/jakartaee9/JakartaEE9ReleasePlan) statement for Jakarta EE 9\r\n\r\n> \r\n> Backwards Compatibility\r\n> \r\n> Jakarta EE 9 WILL NOT impose any backward compatibility requirements for compatible implementations to support the Jakarta EE 8 release. This is aligned with our goal of enabling new implementations to enter the ecosystem. However, we strongly believe that many products and tools will provide backwards compatibility and migration solutions for enabling older applications to run on Jakarta EE 9.\r\n\r\nSo I think the new module 'jakartaee.platform' should be renamed to 'jakartaee8.platform' and remove the revision number?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/670993729/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/671017197","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2302#issuecomment-671017197","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/2302","id":671017197,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3MTAxNzE5Nw==","user":{"login":"jlahoda","id":124144,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDE0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/124144?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda","html_url":"https://github.com/jlahoda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-09T07:16:22Z","updated_at":"2020-08-09T07:16:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Regarding nb-javac, looks reasonable to me.
