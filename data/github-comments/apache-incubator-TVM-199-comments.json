Can you please point me to one or give an example how to do it. Thanks!\r\n\r\n@ANSHUMAN87  Ah...yes. Latest change of this pr doesn't contain this part. The main reasons  is our compiler doesn't be ready for it. For example, imagine we have one resnet18 model and resnet50 model for CPU, our compiler will not generate unique name for them. Both models will have the same function name like `fused_nn_contrib_conv2d_NCHWc_add`. So when our compiler is ready for this, we could enable multi model support. Current pr has considered this situation and we could add this support easily. Previous pr you see the multi model support is one model for CPU, one model for GPU, it just work around and bypass this issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/658014208/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/658023640","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/5753#issuecomment-658023640","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5753","id":658023640,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1ODAyMzY0MA==","user":{"login":"ANSHUMAN87","id":32511895,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNTExODk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32511895?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANSHUMAN87","html_url":"https://github.com/ANSHUMAN87","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANSHUMAN87/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANSHUMAN87/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANSHUMAN87/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANSHUMAN87/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANSHUMAN87/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANSHUMAN87/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANSHUMAN87/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANSHUMAN87/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANSHUMAN87/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-14T07:39:23Z","updated_at":"2020-07-14T07:39:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@FrozenGene : Thanks a lot!

@t-vi  @masahi , @liangfu \r\n\r\nThanks for the review, following  are my comments\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nHua\r\n\r\n#1 about use case and why copy_ ,  from my understanding copy_ is not only a shortcut of .to,  the biggest difference between  copy_ and .clone , .to is that the in place variable would keep it's stride&storage and size, for example for following use case, .clone and .to would cause b lost it's stride/storage information,  running environment is pytorch 1.5.\r\n         a = torch.from_numpy(np.array((11.0,12.0, 13.0)).astype('float32'))\r\n         a = a.expand(2)\r\n         b =

@jcf94 and @merrymercy thanks for all the hard work! Can I request that we put another unresolved issue? In my opinion the written English parts i.e comments, explanations, etc could still use some improvement with both content and grammar and I would propose in general that we do some at least 1 or 2 rounds of full documentation polish (comments, examples, tests, tutorials, etc) before we officially release a feature (in this case when all of Ansor is landed in master). We tried to do this with Relay but I think we should continue to strive to do a better job with new features like this.\r\n\r\nI do appreciate and support the proposal. Let's move forward with the feature upstream process and after the major features being merged into master we can work together to refine the documentation.

What's motivated that instead of just having the codegen itself run the optimizations it needs?\r\n\r\nThe most important reason has been demonstrated in #5915. Since the codegen should return a runtime module without mutating the graph (e.g., run transpose), running optimizations inside the codegen results in inconsistency between the module Relay/TVM processed and the module codegen processed. In the ACL case, it cannot use the unified weight serialization mechanism from MetadataModule but has to deal with by itself. This is not only tedious but also increasing the binary size, because MetadataModule still maintains the original weights that will never be used by ACL runtime.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/659059599/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/659070859","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6065#issuecomment-659070859","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6065","id":659070859,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1OTA3MDg1OQ==","user":{"login":"abergeron","id":1002504,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDI1MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1002504?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron","html_url":"https://github.com/abergeron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-15T23:42:08Z","updated_at":"2020-07-15T23:42:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It seems the mac build actually succeeded but there was a fluke failure.

Thanks for the PR! I have two questions other than the comments:\r\n> \r\n> 1. How to trigger this change (i.e., `to_batch=false`) for an end user? It seems to me that you can configure it only by manually modifying the build_module or VM compiler and rebuilding TVM.\r\n> 2. IIUC, the reason that `ParallelDenseFlatCombiner` derived from `ParallelOpCombiner` instead of `ParallelOpBatchCombiner` is it requires special processes to almost every function, so it seems no benefit to derive from `ParallelOpBatchCombiner`. Now the class hierarchy becomes:\r\n>    \r\n>    * `ParallelDenseBatchCombiner` <- `ParallelOpBatchCombiner` <- `ParallelOpCombiner `\r\n>    * `ParallelDenseFlatCombiner ` <----------------------------------|\r\n>    \r\n>    Since I didn't find any other classes derived from `ParallelOpBatchCombiner`, should we simplify `ParallelOpBatchCombiner` class if we cannot make both `ParallelDense*Combiner` derive from it?\r\n\r\nThanks for your comments !\r\n- In our practice we  just manually call Python api `mod = relay.transform.CombineParallelDense(3, False)(mod)`. \r\nBecause this pass will change the shape, currently we have to manually call it (or relay.optimize(mod) for default optimization) before any auto-tuning step to consider the combined kernel shape and then build.\r\n\r\n- How about improve to make `ParallelOpBatchCombiner` as an exposed optional pass (maybe in another PR)? It can be used like `mod = CombineParallelOpToBatch(\"op_name\", \"batch_op_name\", 3)`. This may serve the original idea of this class and users can combine various kinds of op flexibly. Of course, the use case may be rare in common network structures.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/659137025/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/659141089","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6040#issuecomment-659141089","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6040","id":659141089,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1OTE0MTA4OQ==","user":{"login":"merrymercy","id":15100009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAwMDA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15100009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy","html_url":"https://github.com/merrymercy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-16T03:48:55Z","updated_at":"2020-07-16T04:08:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I added a python version.

What I want is to make a model with operators all on gpu and dynamic input can compile and execute as expected. Such as this network:\r\n```python\r\ndebug_graph = tf.Graph()\r\nwith debug_graph.as_default():\r\n    input_1 = tf.placeholder(dtype=tf.int32, shape=[None], name='input_1')\r\n    result = tf.nn.relu(input_1, name='result')\r\ntarget = \"cuda\"\r\ncontext = tvm.gpu()\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter the compilation of the above network, the shape function for `relu` is located on cpu but the output tensor for the shape function is located on gpu, which causes the `Argument arg1.device_type has an unsatisfied constraint` error. By creating a temporary cpu tensor for outputs of shape function and then copying back to the tensor on gpu, the compilation and execution of the above network can currently work.\r\n\r\nBesides, is it reasonable to deal with shape functions separately, like adding a `Opcode::InvokeShapeFunc` or something else?

That is to say, we still have to generate random numbers and copy to device. However, we should accomplish the goal we could generate random numbers on the remote cpu (if we are in rpc mode) and copy the data from remote cpu (like arm) to remote GPU (like mali) directly, not the path `x86 cpu -> arm cpu -> mali gpu`.
