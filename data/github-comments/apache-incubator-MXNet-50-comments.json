I love this elegant io system that makes the data loading much much easier!!!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/182779916/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/182940345","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/1444#issuecomment-182940345","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1444","id":182940345,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4Mjk0MDM0NQ==","user":{"login":"lukemetz","id":1248454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDg0NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1248454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukemetz","html_url":"https://github.com/lukemetz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukemetz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukemetz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukemetz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukemetz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukemetz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukemetz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukemetz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukemetz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukemetz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-11T16:18:41Z","updated_at":"2016-02-11T16:18:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I was thinking something similar.

Basically, the original `DataParallelExecutorManager` is refactored into two part: a `DataParallelExecutorGroup` is a group of executors living on different devices. All executors in a group correspond to the same symbol. The original  `DataParallelExecutorManager` now keeps reference to a `DataParallelExecutorGroup`. The _current_ group is switched every time a data batch is loaded. Executor groups are created for different configuration (`bucket_key`), and they will be sharing memory with existing executor groups. The created executors are cached in a dict.\n\nThe current modifications are compatible with the existing API -- the existing code that does not use bucketing API could continue to run without any problem.\n\nThe examples are currently buried in corners. I'm planning to write some doc about how to use the bucketing API.\n\nSeveral issues:\n- Currently Travis CI seem to be broken, it has been claiming that gcc-4.8 is not found.\n- The current ptb rnn example runs rather slowly. It is still quite slow after disabling bucketing and using trivial data loading. I'm not sure whether it is due to the weird computing environment in our lab cluster or because of some slow code.\n- The `Monitor`s are installed in executors. For the current case, we will have a lot of executors, some of them will be executed more frequently than the others. I just raise an NotImplemented exception currently if the user attempt to install monitors when bucketing is used.

Once we compile it with CUDA option, whenever we are loading libmxnet.so, it has to find libcuda.so.1, in other words it must be run on a node with GPU on it. We can still use CPU mode to let it runs on CPU only, but must on a machine that has GPU installed. That's might be a potential flaw, can we open another issue or PR stating this problem and close this
