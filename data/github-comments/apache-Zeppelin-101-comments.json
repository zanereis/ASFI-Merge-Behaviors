I made \"clear paragraph output\" in main page for the case that note's output data is too big so it causes Zeppelin fail to load note and hang. \nHere are tickets reporting this issue: [ZEPPELIN-1564](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1564), [ZEPPELIN-1491](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1491)\n\nThe more optimal solution would be improving data loading and rendering itself. We might not need \"clear paragraph output\" button once we improve this performance issue.\n\nI believe having delete button on the main page is beneficial in terms of UX in case user wants to delete multiple notes. They won't need to navigate into each note to delete them.

@minahlee :) This is a cool feature!

(I saw you are planning this after coding, sorry 😢) This is a really good example for implementing it!\n\nSo, the question is this:\nMy branch is based on your PR's branch.

It will speed up merging process if you can review it (I am also going to review it as soon as all the tasks are done).\n\nAbout the jira, there is nothing stops you from creating one so feel free to create a ticket on Jira. And make sure that you assign your self on that task, and put `PROGRESS` label so everyone can see that you are working on it. And for the PR,  I suggest you to do the cherry pick after #1567, #1565 merged, otherwise it will cause some confusion for the ones who don't know the
