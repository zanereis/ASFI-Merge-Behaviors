First the dashboard view should be upfront about which dashboard filters are applied / not applied to each widget as there can be complex logic and conditions at play (`filter_immune_slices` configuration on the dash, and whether the underlying datasource has the field set as \"filterable\" for instance)\r\n\r\nI'm thinking a `text-primary` colored filter icon on the widget header (should be always visible, not only on-hover like other widget-header icons). By hovering the filter icon we'd show clearly which dashboard-level filters are applied and which ones are disregarded.\r\n\r\nNow about the explore view. When the explore view derives from the original slice, we should be very clear about this. So say the saved slice has a certain metric, and I change that metric to another one, then we need to surface that this is an altered version of this slice, and ideally provide context as to the exact diff between the original slice and the current view. This could be done with an `altered` style=\"danger\" label right of slice title, and with a tooltip on that label with the diff list of each control label along with its value-before, value-after.\r\n\r\nIn the case where we'd navigate from a filtered dashboard, you'd land on the explore view with that `altered` label showing loud and clear.\r\n\r\n@graceguo-supercat  is \"reactifactoring\" the dashboard view here https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/3581 and wouldn't start the dashboard view changes until that's landed. The work for the `altered` tag on the explore view could probably start anytime though.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/334962093/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/334962453","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/3611#issuecomment-334962453","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/3611","id":334962453,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNDk2MjQ1Mw==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-07T20:07:16Z","updated_at":"2017-10-07T20:07:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"agreed with @Mogball , the rewrite of the dashboard app taking place now would require rewriting most tests as well anyways.

Since you work on a mac, I assume Nginx and Superset run on the same \"local\" machine. \r\n\r\nHere is the config on my local machine : \r\n\r\nin /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/superset.conf:\r\n```\r\nserver {\r\n    server_name superset.local;\r\n    location /analytics/ {\r\n        proxy_pass         http://superset.local:8088;\r\n        proxy_set_header Host $host;\r\n        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;\r\n        proxy_set_header X-Scheme $scheme;\r\n        proxy_set_header X-Script-Name /analytics;\r\n\r\n    }\r\n    location  ~ ^/(static|superset|sqllab|savedqueryview|druid|druiddatasourcemodelview)/ {\r\n\ttry_files $uri /analytics/$uri;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIn /etc/hosts:\r\n`127.0.0.1 superset.local`\r\n\r\nAbout the trailing slash : it depends on what you need. The behavior is different whether you add a trailing slash or not. \r\n\r\nOn the second location, without trailing slash:\r\n` location  ~ ^/(static|superset|sqllab|savedqueryview|druid) {`\r\n- http://superset.local/druiddatasourcemodelview/list/ is OK\r\n\r\nwith trailing slash : ` location  ~ ^/(static|superset|sqllab|savedqueryview|druid)/ {`\r\n- http://superset.local/druiddatasourcemodelview/list/ is KO \r\n\r\nOn the first location, since the requests are processed by proxy_pass, the behavior is special:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlocation /analytics/ {\r\n        proxy_pass         http://superset.local:8088;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nand go to http://superset.local/analytics, nginx will automatically redirect to http://superset.local/analytics/","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/335272079/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/335287976","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/3533#issuecomment-335287976","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/3533","id":335287976,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNTI4Nzk3Ng==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-09T21:02:43Z","updated_at":"2020-01-28T19:33:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\n[![Coverage
