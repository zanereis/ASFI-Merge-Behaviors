And put them into the directory like `/host/path/to/bigdata`\r\n- Add volume `- /host/path/to/bigdata:/opt/soft/bigdata` for `dolphinscheduler-worker` in `docker/docker-swarm/docker-compose.yml`\r\n- Modify the environment variables in `docker/docker-swarm/dolphinscheduler_env.sh`, such as `HADOOP_HOME`, `SPARK_HOME` or `FLINK_HOME`. For example, modify `HADOOP_HOME` to `/opt/soft/bigdata/hadoop-2.8.3` and `HADOOP_CONF_DIR` to `/opt/soft/bigdata/hadoop-2.8.3/etc/hadoop`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/826325507/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/826326182","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/5378#issuecomment-826326182","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/5378","id":826326182,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyNjMyNjE4Mg==","user":{"login":"chengshiwen","id":4902714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MDI3MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4902714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengshiwen","html_url":"https://github.com/chengshiwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengshiwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengshiwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengshiwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengshiwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengshiwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengshiwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengshiwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengshiwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengshiwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-25T13:38:14Z","updated_at":"2021-04-25T13:38:14Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"In next 1.3.6 release, you can refer to the readme https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/blob/3f47bd8425/docker/build/README.md#how-to-support-hadoop-spark-flink-hive-or-datax.

In the case of **one-click deployment**, such as **docker/k8s**, the first time `alert-server` is started, it often fails because `t_ds_plugin_define` is not created. This will affect the experience of the first deployment of new users. So it would be better to add this judgment.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/826465573/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/826469730","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/pull/5384#issuecomment-826469730","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/5384","id":826469730,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyNjQ2OTczMA==","user":{"login":"ruanwenjun","id":22415594,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDE1NTk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22415594?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun","html_url":"https://github.com/ruanwenjun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-26T03:05:54Z","updated_at":"2021-04-26T03:05:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> This looks like a webhook, maybe the existing HTTP plug-in can meet your needs.\r\n\r\nYes, this is not a requirement, it can be implemented directly using `Http`. However, the disadvantage of the current `Http` method is that it is impossible to judge whether the transmission is successful by the response content return.
