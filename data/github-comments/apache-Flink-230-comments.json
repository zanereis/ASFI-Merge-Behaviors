Even when the assigner returns invalid index, the modulus will ensure that the shard gets assigned.\r\n\r\nThis is exactly what I think the test should be verifying, assuming no knowledge of the implementation details. Using a different custom assigner across executions and restores should not result in any state lose / change.\r\n\r\nAlso, I think this change does touch the part of the code that restores previous state.\r\nOn restore, we get the whole list of all Kinesis shard states (via union list state), and we use the assigner to filter out which shards each subtask should subscribe to.\r\n\r\nSo, it should make sense to add such a test.

The num of the window need to be skipped is according to the degree of the out of order\r\n2.

A subsequent restore may or may not occur.\r\n\r\nAssuming we like this approach, let's discuss how to make it work purely with `restoreLatestCheckpointedState`.   The `restoreLatestCheckpointedState` method is not called by the ExecutionGraph (EG) upon initial execution, which we would want to support the new `initializeState` method.   Would there be any issue with calling `restoreLatestCheckpointedState` on initial execution?
