I need to tweak the script that determines if the dependency:go-offline stage should run or not.  It's checking to see if there's an .m2 directory, but it needs to also check if there are directories within .m2, since the cache step creates .m2 even if there isn't anything in it.\r\n\r\nThe way that Travis creates caches is based on a few factors/settings, and one of them is the JDK being used by the job/stage.  Since the builds either specify a JDK, or use a custom JDK with no label, two separate caches are created by Travis.  I could specify that all the build stages should use the same cache, but I'd like to avoid messing with the cache functionality.  On my branch (before I created the PR) the builds were working because the dependencies were cached.  After tweaking the caching stage jobs, the builds should complete successfully.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/520229809/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/520319514","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3644#issuecomment-520319514","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3644","id":520319514,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMDMxOTUxNA==","user":{"login":"jtstorck","id":19271493,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjcxNDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19271493?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck","html_url":"https://github.com/jtstorck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-12T07:13:58Z","updated_at":"2019-08-12T07:13:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@pvillard31 To get all the builds to finish in time, I had to exclude the nar and assembly modules, which is not optimal, but we can remove the exclusion once we break up the repo.\r\n\r\nThe non-default bundles, from the quick look in the pom I did before, are still compiled and tested without referring to their profiles.

I recently ran into the same problem and was going to post a PR (it's not quite ready yet) with a slightly different solution when I came across this. I took a slightly different approach and wanted to discuss here.\r\n\r\nWhile we could leverage the user/group mappings to transform the values for this use case within the `LdapUserGroupProvider`, the mappings are meant to be applied to the identities and names that come out of a given (any) provider and the identity of the user upon authentication. The comparison happening in this scenario is happening within the `LdapUserGroupProvider` only. The value that associates a user with a group and/or a group with a user comes from an attribute in the group or user respectively. The directory server will not be performing any mappings to associate these two entries. The reason why this is problematic today is that the directory servers may or may not enforce case.\r\n\r\nI would like to suggest that we do not use the mappings to transform the values to support this scenario. If a user did not care to map the user identities or group names, but the did have this problem, they would need to create mapping entries in `nifi.properties` just to support their `LdapUserGroupProvider` configuration. This could potentially affect other providers (if configured to possibly use a composite provider) and when users authenticate. I would like to consider introducing a new property for the `LdapUserGroupProvider` that can conditionally set whether group membership decisions are case sensitive or not. This should hopefully lessen the already confusion configuration and limit the potential effects of this change.\r\n\r\nI should have a PR ready for consideration soon. When I do, I'll link it here.

You're quite right. While my change to the application of transformations does provide a fix for that specific problem, in reality there shouldn't be any need for transformations in the first place. In my case I made use of transformations as a work around for the situation where user certificate DNs, LDAP user DNs and LDAP group unique member DNs were all considered equal based on LDAP's matching rules, but not based on the Java String equality checks that NiFi performs.\r\nDelegating the checks user existence and group membership to the LDAP server would be a reliable approach, but would break NiFi's current behaviour of only hitting the LDAP server once for each refresh of its cache.\r\nAs I understand it, an LDAP server should support being queried to establish which matching rules are applied for each attribute. Specific OIDs are defined for each matching rule (e.g. OID 2.5.13.2 for case-ignore-match, OID 2.5.13.5 for case-exact-match) so is it possible that no extra configuration would be required at all and the provider could simply establish the correct behaviour for itself?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/522275057/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/522624357","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3628#issuecomment-522624357","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3628","id":522624357,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMjYyNDM1Nw==","user":{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-19T15:18:33Z","updated_at":"2019-08-19T15:18:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @bbende.

I like more self-descriptive variable naming like you did in the PR. Now the PR has conflict, if you can address conflict, I'm happy to keep reviewing so that your change can also be merged.

If I expand a group, and then the dialog refreshes (for instance, goes from all steps 'pending' to all steps complete), the group that I have expanded collapses back down, showing just the groups and not the components below them.\r\n> \r\n> I also see that when the request completes, that the dialog shows all steps with a green checkmark, and the JSON coming back shows `\"percentComplete\": 100` and `\"complete\": true` but the dialog still shows a 'Cancel' button instead of an OK. Once I click Cancel, it changes to OK. On a related note, when I do click Cancel, I do not see a DELETE request fired off for the appropriate `update-request`. When I do update the Parameters, I also see the 'spinning circle of death' and a JavaScript error. In Chrome Dev Tools, it shows:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> slick.dataview.js:359 Uncaught Error: Invalid or non-matching id\r\n>     at DataView.updateItem (slick.dataview.js:359)\r\n>     at aj (nf-canvas-all.js?1.10.0-SNAPSHOT:50)\r\n>     at Object.<anonymous> (nf-canvas-all.js?1.10.0-SNAPSHOT:50)\r\n>     at c (jquery.min.js:2)\r\n>     at Object.fireWith [as resolveWith] (jquery.min.js:2)\r\n>     at l (jquery.min.js:2)\r\n>     at XMLHttpRequest.<anonymous> (jquery.min.js:2)\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> Of course, this is minified so may not be very helpful.\r\n\r\n@markap14 I have updated the UX such that the groups of referenced components in the parameter usage section is expanded by default. I don't believe this solves the issue since now a user could still collapse a group and then if they apply an update to the parameter each poll for the update complete will re-render the groups of 'twisties' fully expanded. However, it does seem to alleviate the issue and the implementation is functionally correct.
