To use the same InferType function for different types, we can template them. But the default implementation should be in the header file. Or we can have specializations in different source files.\r\n\r\nSo there are two major discussions here\r\n- Move the code of xxRel for the targeted ops to the header file. This may introduce some confusion because some of them are in the source, but a few are in the header. However, in the future, we only need to change one place of this function (which is the default implementation). This reduces chances for bugs.\r\n\r\n- Have the same implementation for the interested ops under qnn namespace. This has slightly better readability, but it may introduce some extra maintenance burden for XXRels, particularly for conv2d.\r\n\r\nWhile all folks in the discussion don't have strong preference between these two approaches, it looks that the first former is more favorable to more ppl here. \r\n\r\nI would suggest we go the first approach and move forward.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/526272978/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/526274094","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/3840#issuecomment-526274094","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3840","id":526274094,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNjI3NDA5NA==","user":{"login":"merrymercy","id":15100009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAwMDA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15100009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy","html_url":"https://github.com/merrymercy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-29T17:00:06Z","updated_at":"2019-08-29T17:00:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks @apivovarov!
