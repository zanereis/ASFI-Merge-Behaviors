Come on guys you cant stop the testing the first time it runs :)\r\n\r\nAlso Im not sure why the phython.log file is gone and now all the error are being logged in to the main  nifi-app.log. I think having them separated was better and easier to find python errors instead of getting buried in the nifi-app.log.\r\n\r\n\r\n**UPDATE:**\r\nI think I know why this is happening and under what circumstance. I notice that whenever this happens actually the bin folder is getting created upon downloading the dependencies. For example if you look at the log above I'm creating python processor that reads an excel table and converts into array of json records. This processor uses the following dependencies:  \r\n['pandas','numpy','openpyxl']\r\nWhen they get downloaded a bin folder is getting created  with the following file insde:\r\nf2py.exe\r\n\r\nI think this confuses Nifi and once its find the bin folder it thinks thats where venv files are therefore the processor goes into invalid state when it cant find them there.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2163860870/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2164001768","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/8510#issuecomment-2164001768","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/8510","id":2164001768,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM6A_Avo","user":{"login":"bobpaulin","id":1699558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTk1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1699558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobpaulin","html_url":"https://github.com/bobpaulin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobpaulin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobpaulin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobpaulin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobpaulin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobpaulin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobpaulin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobpaulin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobpaulin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobpaulin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-12T22:27:11Z","updated_at":"2024-06-12T22:27:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This is a nice find.

It requires force since it would have a new head.\r\n\r\nBut generally see the first comment.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2173622914/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2173663886","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/8964#issuecomment-2173663886","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/8964","id":2173663886,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM6Bj3qO","user":{"login":"jrsteinebrey","id":155680611,"node_id":"U_kgDOCUd_Yw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/155680611?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrsteinebrey","html_url":"https://github.com/jrsteinebrey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrsteinebrey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrsteinebrey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrsteinebrey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrsteinebrey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrsteinebrey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrsteinebrey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrsteinebrey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrsteinebrey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrsteinebrey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-17T15:06:12Z","updated_at":"2024-06-17T15:06:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@joewitt Yes I was trying to tidy up the PR to the latest main before I made the code change that @exceptionfactory recommended.

for the feedback @exceptionfactory.\r\n\r\nI was aware of that limitation. The current solution works for all of the Python processors currently present  in the NiFi codebase, except for ChunkDocument LANGUAGE property's allowable values where None is returned.\r\nMy feeling was that it is somewhat allowed / tolerated in the Python processor world, as the comment says on the related Java interface:\r\n```\r\n    /**\r\n     * A list of property descriptions for the known properties. Note that unlikely Java Processors, Python-based Processors are\r\n     * more dynamic, and the properties may not all be discoverable\r\n     *\r\n     * @return a list of descriptions for known properties\r\n     */\r\n    List<PropertyDescription> getPropertyDescriptions();\r\n```\r\n\r\nRegarding a more generic solution, it might be more complex and demanding.\r\nI'm not a Python expert, and maybe there are already answers, but I came across the following difficulties:\r\n* Retrieving values with AST gets complicated when the assignment is an ast.Call (eg object creation) or an ast.Name (eg assignment by name). For the former we need to implement the creation logic for each object type, for the latter we need to create a lookup map containing the name and the references to get the actual object not just the name. Creating the lookup map has the same difficulties\r\n* Python is super permissive - as the Javadoc comment says correctly. For example we can define constants outside and inside classes. Another example is the syntax.\r\nGiven we defined a class:\r\n```\r\nclass Descriptor():\r\n   def __init__(self, name, description):\r\n        self.name = name\r\n        self.description = description\r\n```\r\nWe can instantiate the object in three different ways:\r\n```\r\nDescriptor(\"name1\",  \"desc1\")\r\nDescriptor(\"name2\",  description=\"desc2\")\r\nDescriptor(name=\"name3\",  description=\"desc3\")\r\n```\r\nFrom AST perspective these are all different cases, which had to be handled from code. Usually classes are more complex which will result in a rather complex code, or specific to each class.\r\n* Evaluating functions: assignments can be more complex than assigning a constant value or instantiating new object. For example it can be a list comprehension just like in ChunkDocument. Processing expression like this is possible with AST, although it's rather complex, and hard to make it generic.\r\n* Definitions spanning across multiple Python modules. An AST tree is built for single Python module, and does aware of it's dependencies. Although it seems to be possible to process import statement while traversing the AST tree, it will again lead to complex and hard to maintain codebase.\r\nA bigger problem is: at manifest build time not all Python dependencies are guaranteed to be there, as Python processors are async loaded, and are downloading their dependencies after the processor being started as part of a flow. Instead a manifest is created during startup, where a flow is not necessarily present.\r\n\r\nIn summary my intention was to provide a good enough solution to make \"allowable values\" present in the manifest, while considering the current limitations we have.\r\n\r\nFor the dependency download issue https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12959 can be an answer. If the dependencies are self contained, it should be possible to also contain a extension-manifest.xml in the NAR which could be the just picked up by StandardRuntimeManifestService, making the whole parsing logic unnecessary.\r\n\r\nStill, for Python processors without self encapsulated NARs would require a way to provide information for the manifest. \r\nBesides \"allowable values\", \"relationships\" and \"property dependencies\" are also missing function\r\nGiven the above reasons, I'm not confident that AST is the best tool to achieve this.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?

Full run of all integration tests look good.  Scanning through the code changes looks good.\r\n\r\nThis makes me think of our sensitive properties key construct in general.  We should formalize that the purpose of that is simply to help protect accidental distribution of sensitive values outside the bounds of a given nifi cluster.  The better answer and one we didn't have then that we do now is the usage of real vault stored parameters which thanks to parameter contexts and now be handled correctly.  It seems worthwhile to formalize and push to that answer and reduce usage of otherwise locally protected sensitive values.\r\n\r\nI suppose we cache locally such vault values today.  We should not.  They should be retrieved on-deman/in memory only and we keep the protection of them as a function of the vault and the applications permission to access them.  Nothing to do with our sensitive key.\r\n\r\nThis also feels like it helps us make big progress https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13080 on this one at some point.\r\n\r\nANyway long way of saying this is really wonderful to get this cleaned up.  A good step on continuing to make nifi more secure, more maintainable, and allows us to amplify and mature features like vault based parameter providers that we did not have when we made decisions that led to this stuff.  \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nI'm +1 but lets see if other input arrives.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2177243428/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2178074938","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/8959#issuecomment-2178074938","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/8959","id":2178074938,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM6B0sk6","user":{"login":"pvillard31","id":11541012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTQxMDEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11541012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31","html_url":"https://github.com/pvillard31","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-19T08:27:01Z","updated_at":"2024-06-19T08:27:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Merged into 1.x, thanks @turcsanyip ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2178074938/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2178944298","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/8979#issuecomment-2178944298","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/8979","id":2178944298,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM6B4A0q","user":{"login":"joewitt","id":3057465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTc0NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3057465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt","html_url":"https://github.com/joewitt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-19T15:11:07Z","updated_at":"2024-06-19T15:11:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1.  As discussed in NIFI-13414 the property protection mechanisms as-is only offer one-hop misdirection and therefore their scope of protection is limited and we should not imply it is stronger than it otherwise is.

We dont do a different build per runtime environment so that seems tough as-is.

The current version of the pull request includes support for Linux and macOS on x86_64 and aarch64, which should cover the most common use cases. This doesn't make the build specific to the runtime, but instead makes the native dependencies available to those runtime platforms. If the runtime OS and architecture match one of those supported libraries, that support should be enabled automatically according to this initial implementation.\r\n\r\nahhh yeah i see now.
