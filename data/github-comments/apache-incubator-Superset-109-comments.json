We have two diff√©rent datasources: ds1 and ds2, both are Druid datasources, and their columns / dimensions are identical. Only the content (rows) is different. For privacy reasons, we cannot keep the two content in the same datasource. \r\n2. There are 3 groups of users: g1 that may see/access ds1 ONLY, g2 that may see/access ds2 ONLY, and, g3 that may see/access both g1 and g2. \r\n\r\nThe problem is stated with just 2 datastores, but in reality we have some ~100 datastores. Hence, our objective below.\r\n\r\nObjective: To avoid duplication of dashboards and slices, as much as possible. i.e. To have a single dashboard with same / identical slices, which, \r\n- when viewed by group g1 will show the contents of ds1, \r\n- when viewed by group g2 will show the contents of ds2, and,\r\n- when viewed by group g3 (at login) will show as 2 accessible dashboards - with content from ds1 and ds2 respectively, (or at worst, a single dashboard that shows the combined content of ds1 and ds2).\r\n\r\nOur questions to the community:\r\nQuestion 1 - feasibility: Is this first of all possible to do in some way or the other ?\r\nQuestion 2 - how: If feasible, how would you go about doing this ? Please give us some concrete guidelines to work on.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if the problem is clearly understood.\r\n\r\nWe are happy to share the results (either blog or a merge request - as necessary).\r\n\r\nFor us (a big data labs) Superset stands out clearly as an advanced DataViz/Reporting framework, far ahead of notebook-based or traditional tools. \r\nWe are trying to evangelise it within our users.

Curious, why is there a branch to specifically handle a single dimension (which can't be a spec), with no having_filters and order_desc = True?\r\n\r\nI can bring some light into this. [TopN](http://druid.io/docs/latest/querying/topnquery.html) queries in Druid are much faster than [groupBy](http://druid.io/docs/latest/querying/groupbyquery.html) queries, which is why if you could use either one, your definitely want to use `TopN` (it gets mentioned in the `groupBy` spec).\r\n\r\n`TopN` queries are much more limited than `groupBy` queries and also don't guarantee correctness. Their main limitations are that they can only handle a single dimension and you cannot specify the sort order.\r\n\r\nThe much better performance and the broad use case of `TopN` queries justify their use case. We run a very large Druid cluster (>300 machines) with very large individual datasets (>30TB) and it makes a huge difference.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/346372377/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/346377215","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/3821#issuecomment-346377215","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/3821","id":346377215,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NjM3NzIxNQ==","user":{"login":"rpwils","id":7575244,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NzUyNDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7575244?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpwils","html_url":"https://github.com/rpwils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpwils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpwils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpwils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpwils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpwils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpwils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpwils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpwils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpwils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-22T15:06:01Z","updated_at":"2017-11-22T15:06:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I agree this is a nice feature, we want to role this out to 2000 people and the more we can group the better. \r\nHas anyone done any more design on limiting view of slices and dashboards besides the default with data sources?
