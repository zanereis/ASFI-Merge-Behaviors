Maybe there are other linters that operate on this level.\n\nI know about SHACL, and used it a tiny bit, but I am nowhere deep enough into that stuff to be able to raise issues yet. I wrote a small tool to convert OWL ontologies to SHACL shapes. I know that is not logically valid and people like you that know al the ins and outs of the two, will pull out their hair, but for people like me, who use a sub-set of OWL to write kind of data schemas for distributed databases, the two encode mostly the same data, just using different terms. I only use a hand full of properties (range, domain, sub-class, sub-property, type, cardinalities).\nIt seems to basically work how I want it to, with the very limited testing I did so far.\n\nEyeball-NG ...\nWe got funding, and some of it is dedicated to make a basic linter for RDF& OWL.\nWhen organizing the funding, I was not aware that linters already exist (even though I searched in the past). Now I am aware, and decided it makes more sense to raise (one of them) from the grave.\nReally, we are more interested in OOPS, but the issue there is, that it is not open source (which is a requirement of the funding we got, and also one we have personally). The optimal scenario for us, would be to be able to raise eyeball from its (quasi) grave, _and_ convince the OOPs authors to make their tool Open Source, and then provide some cleanup/touch-up/general coding help after that.\nWe are currently (today actually) an argument for that. If you have something to say regarding that that we might forward to them.. please do!\n(Note: we had almost no personal contact with them so far, but I am a big fan of their work (OOPS, LOV, and some other things))\n\nI am mostly a software dev, and not so much an academic. for me, RDF OWL are IT tools, not so much what Biologists, philosophy people, pharma/medical people and what not, see in it. I don't write papers and such ... you get the idea. I would love for them and me to be able to work together on this stuff, as I think we would be much better off this way, as I am weak on the theory, specs and deep intrinsics, but could improve their code quality (they are acedemics, foremost) some, I think.\n\nI plan to actively use eyeball myself, regularly (CI), for all of our ontologies and at least one of a friend.\nIn the best case, it could also be integrated into LOV, or even into OOPS (as they are both written in Java), and then it could benefit all ontologies on/users of LOV.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/2612251795/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/2612288690","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/issues/2975#issuecomment-2612288690","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/2975","id":2612288690,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec6btFyy","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-24T11:22:58Z","updated_at":"2025-01-26T11:20:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"`checkValidIriAndNotAReference` -- yes \"checkValidIriForRDF\"\n\n`jena-iri3986` is general IRI processor - it does not apply or check RDF rules.\n\n`IRIx3986` is the adapter from jena-iri3986 to `IRIx` (which Jena uses everywhere).\n\nA parser will always resolve a IRI against the base (there is always a base):\n\n```java\n    public static void iriProcess(final String iriStr) {\n        IRIx iri = IRIx.create(iriStr);\n        System.out.println(\"Argument: \"+iri);\n        IRIx base = IRIs.getSystemBase();\n\n        IRIx iriResolved = base.resolve(iri);\n\n        System.out.println(\"iriResolved =\"+iriResolved);\n        System.out.println(\"Reference: \"+iriResolved.isReference());\n    }\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/2612288690/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/2612330938","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/issues/2975#issuecomment-2612330938","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/2975","id":2612330938,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec6btQG6","user":{"login":"hoijui","id":42907,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42907?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hoijui","html_url":"https://github.com/hoijui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hoijui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hoijui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hoijui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hoijui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hoijui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hoijui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hoijui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hoijui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hoijui/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-24T11:44:14Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T11:44:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"aHA!\n`isReference` means exactly the opposite of what I though it means.. doh!

When run as a command line tool, that could be acceptable; run as a library, then it is not.\n\nThe rest of the system assumes language tags are unique.\n\nA better way that should work:\n\nThere is a way to tap into exactly what is coming out of a parser before `NodeFactory`. \n\nA parser run has a `FactoryRDF` object. It is settable with `RDFParserBuilder factory`. All nodes creation should be via this route.\n\n`ParserProfile` is the interface of events coming out of the parser including node creation - it includes line/column in the parser.It calls an  `FactoryRDF` \n\nOne method of `FactoryRDF` is `createLangLiteral(String lexical, String langTag)` so it is seeing the language tag before going to `NodeFactory` that canoicalizes it.\n\nBy inheriting or wrapping, you could test the language tag, and pass it on to usual `FactoryRDF` method having noted any issues.\n\nIt is only at NodeFactory.createLiteralLang/createLiteralDirLang that the language tag is manipulated. The `equals` and `hashCode` of Node_Literal are case sensitive so they don't get in the way.\n\nConstructors for `Node_Literal` are package-scoped to prevent apps creating such bad literals.\n\nTo get the line/col number needs a `ParserProfile` but it is harder to set a custom one (possible, but it may need to be per language).\n\n```java\n   static class FactoryRDF2 extends FactoryRDFStd {\n\n        List<String> unwiseLangTags = new ArrayList<>();\n\n        @Override\n        public Node createLangLiteral(String lexical, String langTag) {\n            if ( langTag != null ) {\n                String langTag2 = LangTag.canonical(langTag);\n                if ( ! langTag.equals(langTag2) )\n                    unwiseLangTags.add(langTag);\n            };\n            return super.createLangLiteral(lexical, langTag);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String... args) throws IOException {\n\n        String PREFIX = \"PREFIX : <http://example/>\\n\";\n        String data = PREFIX+\"\"\"\n                :s1 :p1 'abc1'@en .\n                :s2 :p2 'abc2'@en-GB .\n                :s2 :p2 'abc3'@en-gb .\n                  \"\"\";\n\n        FactoryRDF2 factory = new FactoryRDF2();\n        RDFParser.fromString(data, Lang.TTL).factory(factory).toGraph();\n        System.out.println(factory.unwiseLangTags);\n    }\n```\n\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/2616377581/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/2616385165","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/2806#issuecomment-2616385165","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/2806","id":2616385165,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec6b8t6N","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-27T17:05:23Z","updated_at":"2025-01-27T17:05:23Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"They are not in RDF 1.2 - they are ARQ extensions for people who want to explore the EXISTS space.\r\n\r\n`MINUS` is `ANTIJOIN` except `MINUS` has a special case for disjoint domains.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/2616385165/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/2620162548","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/issues/2980#issuecomment-2620162548","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/2980","id":2620162548,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec6cLIH0","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-28T22:12:41Z","updated_at":"2025-01-28T22:12:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This  is different to the CONSTRUCT case.\n\n`CONSTRUCT { GRAPH ... }` is different, extension syntax.

I will put my findings here in the hope that it will be more useful than annoying :)\n\n- Better compression doesn't necessarily mean more CPU time has to be used. In Jelly at some point I've found that by for example de-duplicating the data to be serialized, you also save the CPU that would be normally needed to encode the duplicated data (allocating objects, encoding strings, transfers in/out the memory). So, by spending some time in compression, you save more time later. These kinds of optimizations were key to making Jelly what it is. Of course, this only works to a certain degree.\n- Dictionary sizes (and in general memory usage) must be strictly bounded, while the data may be unbounded. The only solution to this problem is to design your compressor as a stream compressor that only looks at one triple/quad at a time and updates its dictionaries incrementally, while evicting old entries. RDF4J Binary also does this, but it also does a look-ahead in the stream to better estimate frequency statistics. This hurts latency, so Jelly doesn't do the look-ahead part.\n- Wide support among many implementations is hugely important. Jelly supports equally Jena and RDF4J (the core is generic classes) via the respective plugin infrastructures. We are working on implementations for Python and Rust. I consider this the highest priority.\n- Jelly doesn't currently support SPARQL results. I will be working on that in the coming months.\n- Node caching in the parser helps with performance a lot, especially if the format already indexes the nodes in some way. Jelly parser eliminates most node duplicates on the heap with its size-limited node cache that is allocated per-parser. A global node cache for Jena would help with multi-parser scenarios and could potentially boost the in-mem performance a lot, but I currently have no idea how to implement that efficiently.\n- It is possible to get better compression ratios with binary + gzip than N-Triples + gzip. In a test on a diverse mix of datasets ([RiverBench 2.1.0](https://riverbench.github.io/v/2.1.0/datasets/)):\n  - N-Triples (baseline): 100% size\n  - N-Triples + gzip: 1.59%\n  - Jena Thrift + gzip: 1.65%\n  - Jelly: 1.04%\n  - but this is beaten by Turtle + gzip, with 0.97% compression.\n  - This mostly comes down to gzip being a format that doesn't handle binary data that well. If you use zstd, Jelly gets down to 0.87%, versus 0.89% for Turtle. Marginally better.\n  - But yeah, in general the issue is that while you can do cool RDF-specific compression, the additional entropy from field tags and whatnots will be detrimental to the ratio.\n- I tested Jelly with end-to-end streaming on Kafka and it was the fastest thing, regardless of whether compression was used or not. I don't have the nice results yet, as I'm in the middle of massaging them into something that the scientific committee would accept as a \"worthy dissertation\". But I admit that getting to this point is rather hard.\n\nI realize this is a closed thread, so if you'd like to continue the discussion, I guess you probably should contact me in private or open an issue in the Jelly repo. If anyone here also wants to collaborate on Jelly, I'm always open to that :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/2631354887/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/2633318489","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/issues/2987#issuecomment-2633318489","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/2987","id":2633318489,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec6c9UBZ","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-04T09:20:48Z","updated_at":"2025-02-04T09:20:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi @ziodave \n\nA vocabulary does not have to registered with the Jena core system to be used. \n\nThe files in \"vocabularies/\" aren't special - the code does not react to their presence and a constants file can be in any java package,\n  \nMostly, they are W3C related or Jena-specific (W3C vocabaularies are usually quite stable).\n\nThe files provide convenience constants in Java, but they don't contain java for any domain/range declarations or any labels, or (as in the GS1 case) the `owl:sameAs` declarations.\n\nTo use in data, simply use the URIs, with or without a prefix declaration.

The use of SERVICE <loop:> is essentially only justified in combination with bulk requests, such as SERVICE <loop:bulk+5:>.\n> Also note, that the semantics of loop: and LATERAL differ: the former substitutes variables **regardless of scope**, whereas the latter substitutes only in-scope variables. Another difference is, that loop: creates a new execution context for each request (even for local ones) such that the NOW() function will yield increasing timestamps as query execution progresses.\n> Currently, the SE plugin does not support bulk requests under LATERAL semantics.\n\nA note on the background: The reason for this difference is, on the one hand, the service enhancer plugin predates the formalization and implementation of LATERAL and on the other hand the goal was to add the bulk and caching features without requiring changes to jena's core machinery.\n\nIf for some reason this behavior is a blocking issue for you, the best I can offer is to try out the service enhancer from this branch (my working copy of jena):\n\nhttps://github.com/Aklakan/jena/tree/se-fixes-2023-11-29\n\nThis one should allow for writing `SERVICE <loop+scoped:bulk+5:...>` which mimics LATERAL semantics more closely, as substitution is then only performed on in-scope variables. This should behave more in expected ways, but because of the basic substitution there are still corner cases where results will differ from LATERAL.\n\n(Should you try out my working copy, then please report any related issues at https://github.com/Aklakan/jena/issues)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/2642948889/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/2642990345","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/issues/2996#issuecomment-2642990345","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/2996","id":2642990345,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec6diNUJ","user":{"login":"galgonek","id":10591815,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTkxODE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10591815?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/galgonek","html_url":"https://github.com/galgonek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galgonek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galgonek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galgonek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galgonek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galgonek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galgonek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galgonek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galgonek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galgonek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-07T13:46:20Z","updated_at":"2025-02-07T13:46:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you for the explanation, and I apologize for not reading the documentation thoroughly enough.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/2642990345/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/2642996106","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/issues/2996#issuecomment-2642996106","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/2996","id":2642996106,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec6diOuK","user":{"login":"Aklakan","id":839608,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzOTYwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/839608?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan","html_url":"https://github.com/Aklakan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-07T13:47:54Z","updated_at":"2025-02-07T13:47:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"No worries -
